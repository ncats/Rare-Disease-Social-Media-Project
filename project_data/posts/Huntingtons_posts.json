He was abusive to my mum when I was a kid and still hates her and makes up insane lies about her. I understand its partially his illness but I'm not strong enough to not let it get to me. But not living with him means I'm forever worried and anxious that he's going to hurt himself, not to mention the risk of someone breaking in, and just his overall lack of hygiene. He's convinced he has 'just a touch' of Huntingtons, and while his is mild compared to other people I've met he 100% needs care I cannot and will not give him. I've spoken to his GP several times but he insists my dad isn't eligible for care because I'm looking after him. I'm sure if my dad asked then he'd be more likely to get help, but even if the GP was compliant my dad is very resistant. I have no idea what to do, and I doubt I'll get any replies let alone real advice, but I'm desperate.

My dad has HD, stopped working at probably about 35 yrs old, still lives. He's 53 yrs old, and progressively getting worse, but he's not really too bad. He gets a bit restless when stressed, but he's got very light visible symptoms still. For him the symptoms so far has been mental. \n\nSo, back to me. I'm recognizing more and more of my fathers symptoms in myself. Things he's said, and things I've seen. The problem is that most early HD symptoms are things that most people experience at times, so many of them can be interpreted as stress or a normal depression. \n\nSome detail (these are things that I feel have been getting worse):        \n\n* I forget stuff. ALL THE TIME! I suppose most people have walked into the kitchen and wondering why did go there. And most have probably looked for something that they have been holding in their hand, and stuff like that. But to me I feel like this is getting worse. I'm loosing focus and short term memory. Mostly things works fine as long as I'm focused on that one thing, but if anything disrupts my flow, I loose it. Like in conversations. We're talking about something, and someone changes the subject, and one minute later I have NO idea what we were talking about before.          \nBut the really difficult things are the future things (Next day/next week/next month) that I have to do. For example, for probably 4 months I have been supposed to deliver a urine sample to my doctor, and at the same time take a blood sample. This is for something totally unrelated. To deliver the urine sample I have to first go to the drug store to get a container of some sort (don't know what it's called) to piss in. This is fucking impossible. The drug store closes early. I have to remember it during my workday when I drive past it. The doctor have ordered a morning piss. So I have to remember do the following when I wake up: *First get clean and shower. Then first piss goes into the toilet. Then into the container.* Then, during my workday before the doctor closes his office I have to remember to deliver it to him.        \nI went probably two months without remembering to buy the container. During that time I was at the drug store many times, but I bought other stuff. (A normal working brain would connect probably remind me to buy the container when I'm there.) Then, finally I remembered it. I had the container at home for  probably a month without remembering to take use it. Then, one day I smarted up enough to set a reminder on my phone. Finally I would be able to take the sample to the doctor, I thought. The next morning I went through the procedure. Pissed in the glass, and even brought it with me. Then my workday ended, and I had forgotten to deliver it!!         \nI still haven't made it, a month later. \n\n* Also related to memory is \"blackouts\". (not really, but that's what I call it.) It's something that might be happen when I'm talking or writing something, without getting interrupted, I suddenly just freeze. I can't figure out what I was saying or what I'm going to say, it all just stops for several seconds. But more often it happens when I suddenly do something different. Typically when I pick up my phone to check something, (like facebook, the time, reddit, or whatever). I hold the phone in my hand, and just stare at it, not remembering the icon that I'm looking for, or why I'm holding the phone. It usually comes back to me if I sit down, take a deep breath, and focus away from the phone for a moment. \n\n* I'm also having an impossible time with routines. I moved into a new apartment 10 months ago. I still open the wrong drawers in the kitchen. \n\n* I feel like I'm getting more clumsy. Walking into stuff. Kicking my toes into stuff that hurts. At work I'm slipping things out of my hands, and I accidentally throw things. (Like picking up a screwdriver from the floor, and somehow while picking it up I throw it a meter along the floor. \n\n* Socially.. Well, I am introverted, but also this is getting more difficult. I used to be better at getting friends, inviting people, etc. But nowadays I never know what to talk to people about, and like my dad have been complaining about, I have problems keeping focus and paying attention to what people are talking about. \n\nI'm thinking that I might have early symptoms, and I've started the test procedure. \n\nHow does this sound to you? \n\nIf this is actually early symptoms, I don't want to continue working until I get so sick that I need help with everything. I want to stop working, and experience things. Travel, spend more time with friends and family, etc. In my country there's a really good welfare system, and in addition to that I have gotten a very good insurance that secures me enough money should I become permanently sick. I'm afraid though, that since I don't have any visible symptoms that I even if I have HD, they're not gonna let me stop working because I'm not \"sick yet.\" ", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Early HD?

She is slow to take some info in although it really depends on the information. She's been able to pass her classes with all A's since I met her in 8th grade and she's still able to do it. She is having more difficulty in some classes but this is rather because they are AP classes than the fact that her learning skill is deteriorating. She shows symptoms of anxiety and depression frequently, and she does have frequent thoughts involving death and suicide. I think these may be attributed to the fact that she's been bullied and alone a good portion of her life, and she's been made fun of for her Tourette's.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed which helps me feel better about it is that she's shown no very noticeable changes in the past 4 years; She has changed of course, but her learning skill is about the same, her involuntary movements haven't gotten much worse, and her depressive thoughts have actually gotten better since I've started being around her.\n\nI know asking this won't really prove or change anything; Her doctor suggested she may have it and that she gets a blood test, which she is and the results will be in on the twenty second of September.\n\nBut considering that her involuntary movements can be attributed to her Tourette's, her slow learning can be attributed to her mother's poor care during pregnancy, and her depressive thoughts can be attributed to her past, does it sound more like she does or doesn't have it? Please help me out. And please give me honesty.\n\nWe know nothing about her family history and whether or not it involves Huntington's Disease.

It all started with me and a friend talking about why I was unwilling to seriously date any of the girls I met. He was worried about me, and I decided to share what all of us at some point have or will have experienced.\n\nI told him about how my mother died because of HD when I was twelve. About how she was in a home for six years prior to her death. I told him I had a 50% chance of having the disease myself. I told him how I didn't want to put anybody I cared about in a position where they had to take care of me. I told him I would never want to have kids until I was certain I didn't have the disease. I told him I would euthanize myself before the disease could take complete hold of me should I have it. I told him everything, and for the first time I had a serious discussion about my life and the uncertainty of my future.\n\nWe talked about it, and we both agreed I was living my life like I already had the disease. I was holding back on everything in life, and distracted myself by practically living in the gym. We assessed that considering I was already living as if I had it, there'd be no loss in knowing if I had the disease. At this point I knew, and accepted it was time to contact my doctor. \n\nMy doctor was understanding, and helpful. He referred me to the right department at the hospital (sorry I don't know how to put this in English properly, so it's a department). Unfortunately I couldn't just get tested. I had to talk to a psychologist first to assess my state of mind (I'm assuming). Fortunately it only took one conversation. I was sure of what I wanted, and aware of all the risks that came with knowing. The only prerequisite to taking the test was that somebody I trusted would go with me to get the result of the test. After this talk I got the green light to get the test. They took my blood, and the waiting began.\n\nThis part was by far the most stressful. To protect myself, and to protect my job, I decided to tell a colleague I trusted about what was going on. He was the senior of our department, and he helped me through a tough period where I honestly wasn't doing as good a job as I should have been doing. I didn't tell management or HR about what was going on, out of fear of being denied promotions or raises due to the potential risk of my health. The senior had my back, and kept any mistakes I made on a low, and nudged me on them so I could fix them before anybody noticed.\n\nYesterday was the big day. My friend (from the first paragraph) and I went to the hospital, and were both completely nervewrecked about the possible outcome. We waited for what felt like an eternity, until the doctor finally came over. As soon as I saw her heading over the nerves dissappeared, as if my mind was saying it was willing to accept whatever outcome:\n\n***Doctor: Hello.***\n\n*She was holding a big stack of folders as she attempted to reach out her hand to shake mine.*\n\n***Me: Hi.***\n\n***Doctor: Please follow me.***\n\n*We followed quietly...*\n\n***Doctor: Please have a seat.***\n\n*We took our seats, as she closed the door and sat down...*\n\n***Doctor: ...I have good news.***\n\n\nAll I remember is a giant weight falling off my shoulder. I remember asking her if she was sure I didn't have it. She said something about the length of the genes being a good 17 in length, and how this is the fun part of her job. Anything else she said I can't remember.\n\nToday, after my first good night of sleep in weeks (10 hours), my mind is clear. I'm able to process my thoughts properly, and for the first time I feel sure of myself. As if a part of me healed overnight. I'm ready for the future. For the first time, my mind is clear and my will is absolute.\n\nFor those struggling with the same 50/50 chance, who are living their lives as if they are already dying from this disease, I urge you to take the test. I know it's easy for me to say this now, but I would have said the same thing a week ago, and I did the same thing yesterday. Only once you know can you truly set out a future for yourself, be it five or fifty years, you can plan ahead.\n\n\n\n&gt; TL;DR Started with the predictive test process roughly half a year ago, and heard I didn't have the disease yesterday. My advice if you live your life as if you already have the disease without knowing, is to take the test. Inform someone you trust at work so they have your back at work, and someone from your private life so they can support you from the beginning until the end of the testing process. Only once you know can you truly plan for the future without that voice in the back of your head casting uncertainty.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hello everybody, I'm a 29 year old male from the Netherlands, and I just finished going through the predictive test.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/3gunwo/hello_everybody_im_a_29_year_old_male_from_the/"}, {"author": "possibletesting90", "author_created_utc": 1438896854, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_pd4qe", "created_utc": 1438897051, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/3g20eo/in_an_odd_position_should_i_get_tested/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3g20eo", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/3g20eo/in_an_odd_position_should_i_get_tested/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "H4A2nzAO5gX5Sr2j77DgfsuO3RQWYZjhCzz0trt7nzw", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/R8D787VIDKDzoj8Yxvhj-KEWcZLZd0E1sMusFQHihO4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=bd7d81199df3401e7432c798e5d202a7", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/R8D787VIDKDzoj8Yxvhj-KEWcZLZd0E1sMusFQHihO4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=6b5a1bdcd826aaa17e27c42623db78a8", "width": 216}], "source": {"height": 225, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/R8D787VIDKDzoj8Yxvhj-KEWcZLZd0E1sMusFQHihO4.jpg?s=4094c5c894b9445848bf6405cce11ae6", "width": 300}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1440564491, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi There.\nI\u2019m in an odd position, and I think some of you might be able to give me some insight on what to do. My grandfather passed away in his early 80\u2019s when I was 15. Our family always thought he had some sort of mental issue, although I never knew anything conclusive. I\u2019m 24 now, and this past year my father told me that before his death, my grandfather was tested as part of a trial program of sorts. He was positive for Huntingtons. My dad couldn\u2019t remember the full details - I believe he was diagnosed into the \u201cgrey area\u201d [described here](http://en.hdbuzz.net/027). \n\nI obviously very anxiously asked my dad if he was tested. He said he was tested. I pressed further asking if he was positive for it. He didn\u2019t give me a straight \u201cno\u201d. He danced around it a bit by saying something like, \u201cYou have nothing to worry about. Put it out of your mind - you shouldn\u2019t worry about passing it to your future kids or you yourself getting Huntingtons\u201d\n\nI have a odd relationship with him, and I didn\u2019t press him any further. It\u2019s left me with a very uneasy feeling, and after seeing *Into the Lions Mouth*, I\u2019m thinking again about the possibility of my dad having lied to me. He is very much the type of person that would try to avoid hurting me, and It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he said what he said while he tested positive in that \u201cgrey area\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t want my life\u2019s decisions to be made for me. I\u2019m debating on just getting tested so I can know for sure. I want to make informed decisions if I do have Huntingtons. It would change how I live my daily life sure, but it would also greatly change my expectations for starting a family with my wife. Thoughts? I don\u2019t even know if I *can* get tested without proof of a relative being positive. Is that true? Also, any ideas on how expensive it can be? I know it won\u2019t be covered by insurance.

If any of you are in the Chicago area, I'd like to invite you to join Team Run for HD on January 30th as we host a free movie screening of The Lion's Mouth Opens at Columbia College's Film Row Cinema.\n\nThe Lion's Mouth Opens is a documentary that focuses on Marianna Palka (actress, writer, and director of Good Dick) as she bravely faces a life-defining moment as she finds out her results from genetic testing for Huntington's disease. It\u2019s a film about courage, fear, friendship, family, adapting, hope, and knowing something profound about your fate that cannot then be unknown. Two-time Academy Award nominated Lucy Walker (The Crash Reel, Wasteland) captures what unfolds in a way that is raw, honest, and without pretense. This film is especially relevant for those interested in medicine, biology, cinema, psychology, or sociology, as well as those affected by HD, documentary lovers, and the general public. Run-time is 28 minutes.\n\nDoors will open at 6pm for hors d'oeuvres, mingling, and a raffle. Screening begins at 7pm, followed by a discussion with a panel of experts from the HD and medical community. \n\nPlease reserve your general-admission tickets [here](http://eventbrite.com/e/the-lions-mouth-opens-documentary-screening-discussion-tickets-15214355547).

About 2 weeks ago my wife found out that her mother has tested positive for HD. The tests confirmed that she received it from her father but her dad never showed any symptoms or they just didn't know any better to think anything of it. With this new knowledge my wife is now stuck with the decision of what to do. We both kind of feel like we are in limbo until we come to some sort of decision. We were trying to have kids up until we found out about her mom but have put that on hold. If my wife is HD positive then we don't think we want to have our own biological children and adopt instead.(We were always going to adopt at least one anyway.)\n\nMy wife and I have talked a lot about this and I am trying to understand how she feels and where she is at as much as I can. I understand what kind of burden this could be. You can chose not to be tested and just live your life but then always have that suspicion that this or that might be a symptom. Or you can decided to get tested and maybe you turn out positive for HD and she'll be able to see first hand thee effects and symptoms through her mom and think \"That will be me soon.\"\n\nBasically I have come here because I want to help her as much as possible, I can only offer support and encouragement but I would love for her to be able to hear from people in her situation. Did you get tested? Why or why not? How did you come to that conclusion? Any advice you could offer my wife as we try to navigate through this new territory?\n\nThank you for your help and for listening!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons",

First time on here so I thought I'd post a wee something about myself. 26f in New Zealand, father with positive result but no onset yet. My great aunt suffered badly from quite a young age, but I never realised the significance growing up.\n\nDad told us when I was maybe 10 so I've known about the risk for a long time. Older brother and sister haven't been tested.\n\nThought abut getting tested when I turned 18 but the genetic counseling sounded like a drag. I'd always rather know than not. \n\nWhat have been your experiences with the testing process, esp the counseling if you had to.

During my first visit I was asked a series of questions one of them being if I have any uncontrolled movements. I've noticed nothing that I believe to be out of the ordinary but in this area it's hard to detect what would be an emerging symptom to what other people may experience from day to day.\n \nThe main reason for this post is that recently I've been noticing slight tremors in my calves as I fall asleep. I'm a runner and I work out regularly and I know muscles can behave differently when stressed. I've also done me research up and down and I know the symptoms of HD front to back but what seems to be lacking in data is a patient perspective.

Cognitive/emotional effects come first.  This is what I said: \n\n\"No. Yes late onset HD is a thing. There's something the caller was missing though. The inescapable fact is that there is no medicine she could take that would pause her symptoms. If she had it she couldn't hide it. There is no reprieve, there is no \"holding it in\" or whatever. HD is a nightmare.\"\n\nApparently I should have paid more attention to which subreddit it was.

hate speech.  \n\nAnyway, if you do a subreddit search for the key words \"huntington's disease,\" don't respond to anything about HD in trump forums because you will be burned by auto-moderators that don't read what you said, only acknowledge WHERE YOU SAID IT.  \n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "WARNING to people who

I've never heard of this disease before and I was really shocked with her news because, based on what she said, since this is a genetic disorder, there's 50% that she might have the defective  gene too.\n\nHer mother died when my girlfriend was 18 years. She's 31 now, but she never wanted to get tested to confirm or not if she has the same problem. She's afraid to know the results -- she doesn't want to know if she will die like her mother or not.\n\nAfter thinking about this for a long time, I came up with an idea: since this is genetic disorder, I assume (please correct me if I'm wrong) that it's possible to detect the defective gene in a blood sample (or maybe in a piece of hair).\n\nIf my assumption is correct, I'm planning to take a blood sample or a piece of hair from my girlfriend to be tested (without her knowledge) and check the results. If the result is positive for Huntington's disease then I will respect her wish and I won't tell her anything. But if it's negative then I can tell her and remove this huge concern out of her shoulders.\n\nThe idea to have someone tested without her knowledge may sound unethical and I don't blame you for thinking that way, but I'm not trying to do this for ulterior motives.

She has a great way of explaining the cognitive decline. More importantly she shows in here effective methods to compensate. \n\nI am sure some computer wiz to dox her, but leave the poor lady in privacy. \n\n\nI was diagnosed with HD in 2013. I took a medical leave of absence from my job in 2015 with the long term medical insurance I had taken out and at the same time applied for Social Security Disability with the help of my HD doctor ( which really helped speed things along ), the long term medical insurance that continued until Social Security Disability was approved and the benefits kicked in.....\n\n..Most of my symptoms of HD are mild compared to what others are posting on this site and since I am now 62 almost 63 there are a few more cognitive issues than before ..\n\n.....I have implemented several things that help me as I am a widow and live alone ( although I babysit my twin 3 1/2 yr old granddaughters often).......some of these things are avoiding social events and gatherings that there are many things going on and many people talking at once......I go to church but avoid \"group\" conversation....I shake hands and greet other people one on one only and I situate myself so that when I sit I am front and center and usually a wide space between me and any other people.....and I go to sunday school but do NOT go to the group gathering before the classes divide to their individual rooms.....\n\n..I also may make a \"showing\" to bday parties and weddings/funerals ....but then leave as soon as I can to save myself from embarrassing myself or others with comments on things that I should NOT comment on ( part of HD) .\n\n.....at home....I no longer try to do more than one thing at a time....as I get distracted tooo easily.....and have burned things on the stove by forgetting I have left the burner on while I was changing out laundry or folding clothes, etc, ....\n\nI also do NOT watch/listen/read anything that is violent, scary, or immoral as those things get trapped in the HD mind and confuse what is a \"fictional scenario\" with reality and from what I have read and studied the HD mind in dreams and in reality can and does transfer fears of betrayal, distrust, anger, to the real people in their lives from situations that are only on tv, videos, books or in the words of music that we listen to....\n\n...I also try to only have one person speaking .....one on one.....and not several conversations going on within my hearing...\n\n..I have learned that I need to turn off the radio,tv, etc in order to concentrate and retain when I am reading or trying to have a conversation with someone......This presents numerous problems when visiting my kids/grandkids as they seem to always have an electronic game/ television /or other NOISE going on.......so I mostly do NOT visit them, but ask them to visit me and ask them when they do to put away their electronic devices while they are here or if they must answer their phone to go outside or out of my hearing range because it is so agitating to me..\n\n....and I am very sensitive to the volume of electronic media as well as the noise going on around me......especially if there is more than one thing going....\n\nI have found that it is very VERY emotionally upsetting for me if there is a change in plans made by someone other than myself.....meaning if I change my plans, I have had time to think things thru and adjust to what I want to change.....BUT if you change what the plans are....UNLESS you give me time to adjust my thinking ( which usually takes at least half a day sometimes longer) then it is very difficult for me to not react with frustration, and emotional out bursts\n\nRoutine and the stability of knowing (in part) what to expect by planning each day/ week/month's activities is best......even if there are changes that happen ( hopefully changes that can be told me before they come about ) this is best.\n\n.Setting up these boundaries and limitations allow me to function mostly without emotional outburst or confusion....I learned these things and many more in the book by Jeffery Gingold...Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis\" which I believe God allowed me to find....MS effects some of the same parts and functions of the brain that HD does.......\n\nAll this to say so that caregivers and others that have HD but not yet with full blown onset or may either read the book so that they may understand some of what is going on with the HD brain...and set up boundaries/ guidelines that will allow the HD person the ability to function IN SPITE OF HD......\n\nAnd now at this stage of my life....I am finding the more choices I have , such as what outfit to wear or what to fix for a meal, or where to plant a certain thing in the garden......the more choices the more frustrating......so I need \"either/ or\" \nchoices instead of a whole slew of options.........\n\nThis is just to say that others with HD may also be dealin g with these things cognitively WHICH is not near as obvious as the physical aspects of HD.....BUT is more dangerous to the relationships because of the lack of knowledge of the cause of the emotional outbursts........toward others ...",

My hope is you've already visited our website, [HDYO.org](https://HDYO.org).  Since my mom passed, I've been provided opportunities to travel the world to various HD conferences to learn from the experts about the amazing research and initiatives going on that many aren't aware of.

We hit it off right away and talked for an hour until I had to go back to work.  We made plans to meet at the local dog park early the next morning before work.  I remember exactly what she was wearing and how cute she looked.  She had on black leggings and a denim button down shirt.  It was a nice morning and she took off the button down shirt about 20 minutes after we got there.  She was wearing a grey tank top underneath and I definitely noticed how good she looked.  I was totally oblivious to the fact that she wanted me to notice.  Before we left we were talking near our cars.  The sun hit her eyes at just the right angle and  I told her that her eyes looked beautiful.  I gave her a hug and we both left.  She told me later that she thought I was going to kiss her.  I always think about how I wished I had kissed her in that moment.  Everything was perfect.  \n\nThe next night she came over to my place for drinks.  We talked for a few hours about our lives.  I've never felt such an instant connection with another person.  She was beautiful, smart and caring.  I was already falling for her.  A few days later we went on our first date at a new taco place.  While we were out I needed to get something for a school project for my kids.  Not an ideal adventure for a first date, but she was so sweet about it.  She was so understanding and supportive.  I was falling in love.  One night about two weeks after we met she txtd me that she needed to tell me something and it had to be in person.  I knew it was going too well to be true.  There had to be a catch.  \n\nThe next morning we planned to meet at the same coffee shop where we first met.  I live in a small town and the shop was closed because it was Monday, and that's how small towns work.  We walked to a gas station nearby to grab a coffee.  While we were walking over, I asked her, \"what's up?\" and could tell she was having trouble finding the words to tell me what was going on.  As we entered the gas station's convenience store, I was holding the door for her, and I said, \"you're not dying are you?\"  I could immediately tell by the look on her face that she was dying and that it was bad.  \n\nThis was how I learned about Huntington's Disease.  From a chance encounter with a beautiful young stranger at a coffee shop.  After she told me, she said she would understand if I didn't want to continue seeing her.  She gave me some time to think about it and get back to her.  I started doing research and really considered whether this relationship is something I wanted to pursue.  Huntington's is a brutal disease.  About a week later we spoke and I told her I definitely wanted to continue seeing her and see how things go.  I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I also knew that I was very infatuated and quickly falling in love.  \n\nThe next day the power went out on her side of town.  I work from home so she txtd me and asked if she could come job hunt using my wifi.  From that moment on we spent almost all of our free time together.  A month later she moved in with me.  We were definitely moving fast, but every move has felt right along the way.  I've never been this close to someone who knew they were going to be dying at such a young age.  Meeting her has changed my life in so many ways.  I've started thinking about life differently and really began living in the moment.  \n\nAbout 3 months ago I was on a work trip, and I got a txt that she was just at a doctors appointment and she received bad news.  I called her immediately, and she told me the disease was progressing faster than they thought and she only has 1 to 2 years left to live.  I dropped everything and drove 9 hours home to be with her that night.  She wasn't taking the news well, and I was really worried about her mental state.  It was such an overwhelming feeling to know that someone you love so much only had such a short time left to live.  I can't even imagine what it would be like from her perspective.\n\nA month later she got a call from her doctor that she was accepted into a new trial!  It was a trial that I read about in the newspaper last November.  I couldn't believe that it was true.  It was a real life miracle.  She told me not to get my hopes up, but they were up so high.  For the next 2 months she was flying out to California to receive the treatment.  Her symptoms virtually vanished.  She was doing so much better.  When she was due for her 3rd treatment she called and they told her there was a problem with the scheduling.  About a week later her symptoms started to come back, but they were a little different.  Things would happen earlier in the day when they used to only happen at night when she was tired.   She called them and they said that they were waiting for a doctor to fly in who could administer the dose, and they needed her to keep track of her symptoms.  Two weeks later they told her that her body was rejecting the treatment and they were going to drop her from the trial.\n\nCurrently she is feeling suicidal and I don't know how to help.  I feel so powerless and alone.  I am so sad right now.  I don't know what to do or who to turn to.  She is my best friend and I love her so much.  She doesn't want to go through the later stages of the disease, and wants to end her life.  I don't blame her for wanting that, but I don't know how to handle this.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 414, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm so sad and I don't know how to handle this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/8jyquu/im_so_sad_and_i_dont_know_how_to_handle_this/"}, {"author": "stephanieaj90", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1526440909, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/8jrsv7/gofundme_page/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8jrsv7", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/8jrsv7/gofundme_page/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Xp_KEJbKPmz8LIe9qnrhFRa29K9tUgQiP0P0yvMrpPg", "resolutions": [{"height": 72, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/IbIt_BDRUlprzMyqd1ZsbR16QpYW9zlW0mGmGEbQ8GI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=29b00de8286993cc9d13c6eb0dc568c3", "width": 108}, {"height": 144, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/IbIt_BDRUlprzMyqd1ZsbR16QpYW9zlW0mGmGEbQ8GI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=f7783f24c81ac98cec70a28346598626", "width": 216}, {"height": 213, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/IbIt_BDRUlprzMyqd1ZsbR16QpYW9zlW0mGmGEbQ8GI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=ceaee614f85e4c5889a091c9408b35ad", "width": 320}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/IbIt_BDRUlprzMyqd1ZsbR16QpYW9zlW0mGmGEbQ8GI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=fee9047028c37db8a560aca246d893f8", "width": 640}, {"height": 640, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/IbIt_BDRUlprzMyqd1ZsbR16QpYW9zlW0mGmGEbQ8GI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=f4ecfa32d311e18180db935499106614", "width": 960}, {"height": 720, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/IbIt_BDRUlprzMyqd1ZsbR16QpYW9zlW0mGmGEbQ8GI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=0c1636a4d59cedafea2aa26bf0aeb8a0", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 800, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/IbIt_BDRUlprzMyqd1ZsbR16QpYW9zlW0mGmGEbQ8GI.jpg?s=32ebc1701ba52e8f4254d70a77f484cc", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1526440911, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 414, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "GoFundMe page", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/8jrsv7/gofundme_page/"}, {"author": "stephanieaj90", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1525173405, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/8g7o1w/showing_symptoms/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8g7o1w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/8g7o1w/showing_symptoms/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1525173406, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 5, "selftext": "So lately I've been afraid that I'm already showing minor symptoms of Huntingtons but I feel like I can't tell my husband right nkw cause he's already so depressed and anxious as it is and he even thinks about suicide (just thoughts as far as I know \ud83d\ude15). I'm normally a very anxious person and it's really hard for me to sit still in a chair or couch or wherever. Now I'm finding myself doing it a lot at night too. My mom had restless legs syndrome and I do get really anxious at night, but as I'm sure you all know when your at-risk or know you have it, it's really hard to see anything but HD. I am consistently uncomfortable and finding myself shifting around a lot.  I feel like at times I feel my arms doing the same but it could just be my imagination. I know at times it's hard for me to drive and my husband will yell at me for going over curbs I didn't see and sometimes revving up the car with the gas and then letting off a lot, sometimes for a few minutes and I remember that's how my dad drove when he first started showing.\n\nI've been having facial tics a lot lately. I call them nervous tics for now since they really come out more when I'm stressed (it mostly happens at work which is weird cause I love it). It's been happening for 5 or so months and it's really embarrassing and fairly obvious. \n\nThen there's still the cognitive stuff. I really want to get off my anti-depressant and go on a new one but every time I ask my psychiatrist she says no! I want to at least eliminate the possibility of my issues being from me meds or HD related. If I can't change my meds and find out the anxiety of it all is going to kill me. Does anyone know if you can have delayed side   effects on an anti-depressant? I have a very educated therapist who does a lot of different work and he said i can have delayed ones but my psychiatrist immediately said no. I mean has anybody here had that happen? If so, I might look into seeing someone else.\n\nI've had such a rough year so far and at the time, was in a span of 4 months - diagnosed with HD in February, had a miscarriage in March, and had my mom pass away mid- April. My mom dying has significantly taken its place as the worst thing so far since she died so suddenly and was my very best friend. But the damage had already been done from all the other shit I've been put through. It could be all stress  related but I just can't stop thinking it's HD, you know? My mom was the only person I went to about it cause she lived it too taking care of my dad &amp; grandma years back.

Were they different for different family members? \n\nHow are you managing your symptoms if you have any? \n\nIs anyone taking \"preventative measures\" (exercise, blueberry extract, antidepressants ... Any others out there?) \n\nMy Mom got sick very quickly. And it made her mentally like a teenager. I have a hunch that the break up with my Dad triggered her to get ill early (he was addicted to drugs, abusive to my brothers and I and also cheated on her). She began to date a lot of bad men and started smoking a lot of pot. And then she started leaving for days at a time leaving me to care for my brothers (I was 12 they were 8 and 6). Eventually CAS was called and we were to be put in foster care but my paternal grandparents took us in. After that she continued to \"party\" and was taken advantage of by many people. She kept denying she needed help, and pushed a lot of people away. Eventually my Grandpa got power of attorney over her and put her into assisted living. She declined quickly over three years then was put into a nursing home. She then got pnumonia and MRSA and ended up on a feeding tube and is now immobile as well. I haven't been able to regularly visit her anymore since then. It hurts me too much and makes me feel horrible. She was an amazing caring mother, and although she made bad decisions for herself I know she loved us. \n\nMy Grandma was different she progressed slower and was put into a home about eleven years ago. She can still eat, but doesn't really talk, and is in a wheelchair. She was mentally childlike but she lived with my Aunt and Uncle for some years which kept her out of trouble. And even before that I don't think she got up to much else. I don't think she even presented as ill (personality changes) until I was a few years old. (27 now)\n\nI think the thing that worries me the most is losing myself. I can deal with the physical changes ; I mean look at Stephen Hawking and all the amazing things he did! But I am so scared of changing into someone that my family grows to resent or hate. Or misteating the people I love. That is what scares me more than anything. \n\nMy Aunts are postive and they are going slower than my Mom. My one Aunt seems to have it more physical than mental. And the other seems to be slipping mentally a bit.

Aside from making it feel like an AA meeting let's all say 'Hi' and share some things about ourselves or our family. No pressure so share status/names etc. \n\n\nI am 27. My Mom is HD + so are my Grandma and two Aunts. I grew up knowing what HD was and ver immersed in my Grandma and Mother's illness. I had to be taken away from my Mom due to her mental degrade causing her to make unsafe decisions regarding the care of my brothers and I. She is now in a home unable to walk and eating through a g-tube. It hurts so much to see her like that. I want to get tested in the near future. I think a positive diagnosis would probably make me upset, but would not really change my life much at all. I have mostly tried to think that it is pretty likely I am positive so best to try and think that way (less disappointing). \n\nSo happy to have found people who understand.

We'll be finalizing the research dates next month, but I wanted to post now so people could come to me with questions. As with all research, it's important to me everyone involved has enough time to have any questions answered before taking part. \n\nSo, here's a little bit of information about the study and what we hope to learn:\n\n* It's a 360-view of the illness. This is look at the patient, family and caregiver journey through HD. That includes siblings with survivor's guilt, children of those with HD, and, of course, individuals with HD who are willing to share their journey. This is one of the most robust studies I've seen for any disease in years.\n* A look at what families struggle most with as far as HD is concerned.\n* What HD side-effects are hardest to deal with. (There is a lot of new pharmaceutical research in this space. They're looking at further development, and the opinions gathered in this study may lead to further research.) \n* There will **no** discussion of you changing medication. That's probably obvious by the fact I said it's an \"opinion-based\" study. I want to make that very clear. This study is based on your thoughts, feelings, and insights on HD. \n* We only want to speak to people who are comfortable sharing their opinions. However, if you have any random thoughts you would like shared with the research team, you can also send that to me! I'll make sure they get included. \n* It's a 60-min virtual interview. \n* Respondents will be completely anonymous. All results will be reported in aggregate. \n\nYou can reach me at Gail.Oesterle@shapiroraj.com. You can also call me at 312.321.8295. As with any study, your comfort matters most to me.

Last week I heard the CEO speak, and he talked about the things that make Reddit truly great \u2013 which is the conversations and support from others. This week I found out my husband is positive for Huntington\u2019s. His mom has it, and we\u2019ve seen her family members hit rock bottom and pass away, the symptoms and complications were so severe. We have a child, he\u2019s 4. \n\nI am terrified. \n\nI feel incredibly selfish and know I shouldn't be \u2013 I\u2019m not the one sick and all I\u2019m thinking about is what this will mean for my son as he grows up, in part what it means for me and how it\u2019s going to affect every aspect of our life. My husband talks about his mom and how hard it was growing up with her mood swings, treating her husband horribly one second and great the next, going back on decisions, poor reasoning, etc. Is that going to be him and me? I\u2019m scared for my son to have to live with that (completely aside from the fact he could have that mutation, too). \n\nIf I were someone else, I\u2019d say\u2026 Take it day by day. Travel more, read more, laugh together, go exploring, breathe fresh mountain air, appreciate the little things... \n\nI guess I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing here and I don\u2019t have a question\u2026 I\u2019m just\u2026 it feels like a bad dream and I keep waiting to wake up and know it\u2019s not real. All I\u2019m thinking is I\u2019m going to lose my best friend and I\u2019m going to watch him turn into something that\u2019s so far from \u201chim\u201d mentally first. \n", "spoiler": false,

My husband is a long time redditor and recommended me this sub-reddit to find people to talk to. \n\nThe disease is on my dad's side, and has essentially wiped everyone out in their family. My great grandma, grandma, 2 uncles, and my dad all had it (and who knows how much further back it goes). My dad was diagnosed when I was 6, and most of my memories of him are of my \"sick dad\". Never really got to know my REAL dad, the man he was before he got sick. I thought Huntington's was a somewhat normal disease when I was younger because so many people in my life suffered from it.\n\nI had always been afraid of being diagnosed with it the moment I found out it was genetic. I feared it my entire life, and I was so sure that I had it, but never had the balls to get tested. I just wanted my life to be mine, and not knowing was better than knowing for a long time.\n\nI met my husband in undergrad school, and we had a daughter, (who is almost 3! D;) and got married and finally settled down in a house. My husband has always known about this disease being in my family. He did his internship in hospice care, and worked with 1-2 Huntington's patients, and he really grew to know the disease.  That's actually one of the reasons I married him because I knew if I did test positive, he'd take good care of me and would have an idea of what to do (though he's never actually lived with it).\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I started experiencing some severe brain fog, short term memory problems, and trouble concentrating. I figured it was probably due to an anti-depressant I had been on for awhile so I decided to see a therapist &amp; psychiatrist. Nothing seemed to change, so my husband and I thought for sure I had ADD. But there was just that prominent sign poking out in front of my face every day that said HUNTINGTONS. I was in a much more secure place than I was when I used to want to get tested at 19 (good fucking thing I didn't). So I talked to my husband about how I wanted to get tested just to rule things out so I didn't have to keep suffering with not knowing. All of this crap going on right now was more worrisome than getting tested, so I got my blood drawn about a month ago.\n\nMy results appointment was for the 15th, and on the 8th, I found out I was pregnant, which was completely unexpected! I really wanted to believe it was something else that was wrong with me. Like, what horrible God/entity/etc. would make a sick woman pregnant, right? The minute I heard the counselor say, \"unfortunately\" I lost it. I had the exact same results as my dad too.\n\nI have been a mess ever since. Not only am I pregnant, but now I have to hope that things won't progress any further than they already are now. This mental crap has been the worst thing to ever happen to me, and now it'll only get worse from here? Made some calls/texts to friends who were anxiously waiting for my results. A lot of people who didn't know what to say (obviously, and I don't blame them).  My husband has been extremely supportive and has been my rock these last few days. I have a lot of crying spells, as I'm sure a lot of you out there probably experienced. Right now, I am just so mad. I am mad at God and the world. I really wanted to put an end to this after all the beautiful souls that were taken away far too early. And I'm mad because I wasn't even 26 when I first had symptoms. How fucked up is that?!  Usually you don't start showing symptoms until your 30s or 40s (and I realize 26 is CLOSE to 30, but I am still in my 20s- I'm young). \n\nI was sort of spiraling last night and sobbing as I texted my husband when he was at work. My mom was completely against me getting tested because she knew it had ruined people when the results came back positive. And I tried to stay optimistic, like \"oh I've got a lot of support and at least getting a positive result at my age can get me into a lot of trials\". And I was so mad at myself last night. I wished so badly I could undo what I did. My world was mine and I was happy and it was just me living with symptoms with no known cause. A pregnant happy mom and wife. This completely broke me, and my poor husband has been picking up the pieces. I just feel like I'm going to be a terrible mom this time around because my cognitive skills suck. What if I have to do something really important for the baby and I'm stuck on auto-pilot? What if I miss something and the baby gets hurt/sick? And my 2 year old adores babies, so I think she'll be really into helping and whatnot, but there's only so much she can do.\n\nToday was a good day though. Like I said, back and forth emotions. Yesterday I cried A LOT and today I was fine. Have my daughter here to hang out with, my mom is staying the night. I'm not crying myself to sleep and hyperventilating. Currently, I'm excited about this baby. I'm just so scared to see when and how soon more symptoms will arise. I think I was given my daughter when I was 24 so I can see her grow up and spend more time with her than my father did. I was so hopeful for that, but she's not even 3 and I'm already having issues /:\n\nI'm so sorry for the long post. I even tried to make it short, but I appreciate anyone who took the time to read it.\n\nGoing to look into support groups around here too, but I thought joining an online community so to speak would be helpful too. Any tips, information, or whatever you want to throw my way is appreciated. \n\nHope to get to know some of you!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm new and just got tested positive for Huntingtons.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/7yb8rk/im_new_and_just_got_tested_positive_for/"}, {"author": "imnotclaire", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1517535072, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/7unt8l/unsupportive_partner/", "id": "7unt8l", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/7unt8l/unsupportive_partner/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1517596268, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 5, "selftext": "I don't really know how to put this because my head is all over the place right now.\n\nI've been with my partner for almost three years now, I'm 23 F and he 26 M I was recently diagnosed with HD (last October) no symptoms and most likely not for a while -my CAG count is 45.\n\nMy partner has been far from supportive which I wouldn't have imagined before this as he's always been a little too laid back about things but this is our first real challenge.

She didn\u2019t even start showing symptoms until she was 53, and even now she her symptoms are on the mild to moderate side. However, after many years as a independent civilian technology consultant for the nearby Air Force base and part time junior high middle school teacher, her symptoms have progressed enough that she can no longer work. \n\nOne of the most painful things to deal with has been to watch my mom, who has alway been vivacious, commanding and constantly bustling around in control of everything, turn into someone who spends hours and hours every day sitting on the couch staring into space. I know she is bored and feels useless, but she simply does not have the capacity to do the things she used to do. \n\nI wish I could help her think of a hobby or service project that she could do from home while we\u2019re all at work during the day. We\u2019ve suggested things like volunteering at the local library, but unfortunately she can no longer drive. She lives in a small and mostly isolated farming community. Plus, the Huntington\u2019s-induced personality changes have manifested in her as crippling anxiety. I would shell out for a personal driver or car service in a heartbeat, but the thought of leaving the house without my dad or one of her kids sends her into a panic.\n\nThis post is already far longer than I had intended, I\u2019m sorry.

It was then that him and his siblings were told about the 50/50 chance. I was quite young and had no idea, we never really spoke about it but my dad put off his testing for awhile.\nBut then came 2016 and my dad was tested, again I had no clue. Then I googled it all and it was what sent me all the way down hill from there. The first reading all about it made me physically sick. It really messed up my health, I went to the doctors and was diagnosed with depression. And because I started reading about the 50/50 chance, I thought I was seeing symptoms in myself, twitching, shakes. Turns it out was due to anxiety and stress, as I was getting stress headaches quite often.\n\nI've explained it to my friends but I don't think they really understand it that well, or what it really means for the future. So I can't really talk with them about it. I try not to bring it up with my family at all.\nI'm currently seeing a councillor, I'm in my 3rd session.\n\nHe asked me about my testing decision, the only way I could explain it was that I didn't want too because I thought that if an animal had HD, they would euthanise them. Or at least that's what I would want for myself if I tested positive, but tbh in the long run I'm still uncertain about testing. \n\nI have days where I can put it to the back off my mind, and feel \"normal.\" But other days like today, it can get really get to me and I don't know where to turn. So I've came here.\n\nThat's all, thanks for reading.\nLook forward to reading your replies, as it would be great to speak with others.

Im on mobile plus my hands are acting up so typing is a little hard.\n\nSo, yesterday I was driving to my job to pick up my new schedule. When I saw it, it was really shitty hours, but nothing too horrible. I got madder than I've been in a while. I drove like a maniac and then eventually had to pull over and calm down. This is... very out of character for me. I have always had a bit of a temper, but this felt... random and out of my control.\nDuring this, my hands were twitching horriblely. They have been now for about a month, with varying degrees of severity. Normally it's just my fingers, but sometimes it's my whole hand or arm. \nAlso, for about a year now I've noticed a steady decline in my ability to think quickly. I am becoming overwhelmed easily, and am losing the words for things. I lose items constantly, forget about things, and my organization skills have taken a hit too. I also sometimes kinda, well, fall over for no reason. As if I'm dizzy or something. \nI was recently diagnosed with reactive hypoglycemia, so I was under the impression that this clumsiness was my blood sugar, but it's becoming more frequent even when I take care of myself. \nI am VERY scared this could be Huntington's. I do have a an incredibly small family history of it (my great grandmother on my mother's side had it) so I know there is a possibility.\nI've always been so quick, and so smart. I'm so scared of losing myself. I also have a fiance, and we are just about to get married. She knows this is a possibility, and doesn't want to leave me, but I'm still so scared of putting her through this.\nI also don't have money for a doctor. My father is a doctor, but I'm his little boy. He will avoid the subject, and deny it. My mother will flip out and worry more than I am, so needless to say I don't want to tell my parents unless I know for certain. \n\nMy question I guess is, to those suffering from Huntington's, does this sound like the beginning?\n\nIf so, I will save up money, get insurance, and see a doc.\n\nThank you for you're time, and I apologize if it's a little all over the place I'm a little scatterbrained right now.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "So, I May Have Huntington's and I'm Freaking Out", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/6ieclw/so_i_may_have_huntingtons_and_im_freaking_out/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "Hanawa", "author_created_utc": 1410275786, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_ibjx4", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1497964228, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "edited": 1497964481, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/6idx7f/jci_article_crispr_and_chinese_mouse_study/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6idx7f", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/6idx7f/jci_article_crispr_and_chinese_mouse_study/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Pmuqg0jEe-L_xKI4GWhqabkg1Hp-LvPHm_-H2GpJw1Q", "resolutions": [], "source": {"height": 89, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/gmRVLXSfxb6t5JKyIszN7hj2s8Q2MLJVL9lPB8XcsKo.jpg?s=3beef4db77751bb6612628adcb57fde5", "width": 100}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1500161620, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "A few article titles jump out at people googling about HD research this morning.

It's good news, but celebration would be premature.  When something works in primates I'll get excited.  For now it shows what CRISPR might be capable for people some day.    \n\nFrom the [**Genetic Engineering &amp;\nBiotechnology News Article**]\n(http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/crispr-reverses-huntingtons-disease-in-mice/81254532)    \n\n\"Emory researchers previously showed that mice older than four months do not need the huntingtin gene to stay healthy, suggesting that treatment strategies that aim to shut off both copies of the gene in adult humans could be safe.    \n\nThe main challenge... came from trying to target the gene-editing system to the appropriate area of the brain. ... The scientists injected viral vectors carrying CRISPR/Cas9 into the striatum region of the brains of Huntington's disease model mice at the age of 9 months. The striatum is a region of the brain that controls body movement and motor function.  This led to a dramatic decrease in aggregated mHTT in the striatum three weeks later. The study revealed the capacity of brain cells to heal themselves if the genetic source of the toxic proteins is removed.    \n\nMoreover, in comparison with control Huntington's mice, CRISPR/Cas9-injected mice showed significant improvements on tests of motor control, balance, and grip strength, although they did not recover to the point where they performed as well as control mice.\"     \n\n[**Medicalxpress Article**]\n(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-06-crisprcas9-gene-reverses-huntington-mouse.html)", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "JCI Article : CRISPR and Chinese Mouse Study", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/6idx7f/jci_article_crispr_and_chinese_mouse_study/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "JamesTheMannequin", "author_created_utc": 1418054233, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_jvyeh", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1497879573, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/6i6gam/anxiety_attacks_cold_sweats/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6i6gam", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/6i6gam/anxiety_attacks_cold_sweats/", "retrieved_on": 1500157904, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Diagnosed almost 2 years ago. \n\nIn the last 5-6 months, I've been waking up in cold sweats and having major panic attacks, particularly in the morning.

I'm just a random guy who has no direct experience with Huntington's Disease. However, I met a woman last year named Kathy Gibson, and she is an artist who had become a full-time caregiver for her sister, who has since passed away from Huntington's Disease. She also had a brother who died from Huntington's Disease.\n\nThere wasn't anything in the sidebar to indicate whether this subreddit is strictly a resource for people with Huntington's Disease, or whether it's intended for all people touched by Huntington's, so I'm taking a chance with this post. I just wanted to share this woman's art, because I found it very touching, yet very haunting.\n\nAs someone who has had no direct experience with Huntington's Disease, not only has her art made an impression on me about the toll this disease takes on those who are diagnosed with it, but it also struck a chord with me as someone who partook in the caregiving experience with my mother, who died from breast cancer.\n\nSome of the photos of the artwork don't do the pictured piece any justice, but others are positively striking. I do sincerely hope that my sharing of this is not inappropriate or offensive to anyone in this community. If it is, I will happily delete the post or accept any downvotes I earn. Without further ado:\n\n[Artist Kathy Gibson's Caregiving Experience](http://kgibsonart.com/gallery/)\n\n**Full disclosure**: *She does sell prints, some proceeds of which benefit the [Huntington\u2019s Disease Society of America](http://hdsa.org/), but my post is not about that. I do not have any stake in the artist's success, nor do I have a personal relationship with the artist. I was thinking of her and did a search for her artwork and just felt compelled to share with a community that might appreciate it.*\n\n*I'm not being compensated in any way for this post or the results thereof. Nothing of value will be given to me, including gratitude from the artist, as she doesn't have a clue what Reddit is, let alone that someone is posting about her there. Frankly, I'm not even sure she'd remember meeting me.*", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self",

We thought his mom was in the clear since she is almost 60.

Caring for her has been a full time job for me on top of being a first time mom and working. It\u2019s very tiring. I\u2019m worried that once his mom passes it will be time to start taking care of him. I know it\u2019s selfish to think of myself in this moment considering I\u2019m not at risk. But this isn\u2019t how I pictured my life being. This isn\u2019t what I wanted for my family. \n\nMy husband is in therapy and I start therapy this Friday. I just need some encouragement right now and am wondering when you guys think a cure could be discovered based on where science is at right now. I do research constantly but struggle to find a timeframe. I feel like if I can read that the cure might be here in 5 years then I can hold out until then and take it 5 years at a time. \n\nMy husband is going to get tested next month.

As you who know the disease can attest, not all is on the surface with shaking; often mental problems are the face of the disease. The code F01.5 mixed dementia is what you want to get your neurologist to diagnose. A good tool for getting that diagnosis is a neuropsych exam for competency. \n\nThe Badmom just finished going through this. Her official F01.5 diagnosis came after the second rejection but before the human judge. When the judge saw that, she had us put the date of disability to that time, and approved it all. It made it so Badmom didn't have to explain in detail how life sucks. As it was, it was really hard for her. \n\nI hope this helps one or two others. For those in other countries, what is your system like? I heard recently that UK has a 40% suicide rate, could that be part of the reason, does your system suck?

My wife, who has HD, went to her sisters house over an hour away to spend the week. After 1 day there she wanted to come home. I couldn't get off work till 5 PM and traffic was horrible it would take an hour and a half both ways to go get her. Our son goes to bed at 7 since he has to be up super early for day care driving to go get my wife would put him hours past his bedtime. I expressed to my wife that I was frustrated with her changing plans but started the drive anyways. During the 1.5 hour drive my wife sent me over 40 texts that were hateful, angry and spiteful. When I got to my sister in laws house she wasn't even excited to see our son who she'd been away from for several days. She had also broken her phone in a fit of rage. I didn't get mad or upset and apologized immediately for my being frustrated earlier with her. I was trying to defuse the situation and ge us back home. My wife was furious with me. \n\nWe didn't talk for half the way home when she out of no where brought up an old argument I thought we had ended weeks ago. Traffic was worse than expected, I had worked 12 hours that day, the baby was cranky as it was past his bedtime and I snapped. I didn't tell but I let my wife know all the resentment that's been building up for the last few years. Everything I said was true but at her advanced stage of HD she doesn't mean to do, say and act the way she does. I told her how she was ruining our lives and makes everything so difficult. How me constantly putting out the fires she makes are wearing down on me. How being a single parent to our son and taking care if her is killing me on the inside. Needles to say she was very upset and started crying. She cried the rest of the hour it took us to get home.\n\nWe got home and I immediately put our son to bed. I then discover that my wife hadn't showered the 3 days she'd been gone and smelled really bad. She didn't want to bathe. I drew a bath for her and washed her and carried her to bed. I apologized for my horried behavior and asked for her forgiveness. I gave her her meds and we both went to sleep. \n\nNote: My wife was diagnosed with HD at 18 years old and had a CAG repeat of 66. She was given ten years to live. She's 23 now. She hasn't been able to work for several years due to her declining mental health. Our year and a half old son goes to fulltime daycare as she can't take care of him alone at home. My whole life revolves around her and her appointments. I'm trying my best I really do. I feel terrible for last night's events.

If anyone takes the chance to read the whole thing, thank you so much.\n\nI\u2019ve known I\u2019ve been at risk to get Huntington\u2019s since I was around 12 years old but I guess I was too young to really understand what the meant until about a year ago. My mom sat me aside one day and told me and it was a pretty big shock considering I never really knew my dad. My mom got pregnant with me at 17 and my dad  tested positive at 18 when my mom was already 3 months along. They broke up shortly after I was born so I never got to see the progression. Well, I am now 18 and I told everyone who knew that I could have it that I wanted to get tested as soon as I turned 18. I turn 19 in 3 months and I still haven\u2019t gotten enough courage to do it. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not sure if I want to get tested now. The only reason I want to is the take this weight off of my shoulders and to have a chance to be normal. It sucks being 18 and have your whole life ahead of you but having the fear of getting HD looming over your head everyday. The older I get, the worse I worry about my future and the possibility of getting HD. I know there\u2019s a chance that I won\u2019t have it but it\u2019s taking the leap of actually knowing which scares me more than anything. I feel like once I know, my life will be over before it\u2019s even started. It\u2019s gotten really hard to stay positive and I\u2019m at a constant battle with myself to wether or not I should get tested now or wait. part of me feels like I\u2019m putting myself through unnecessary pain because there\u2019s a chance I don\u2019t have it and all the crying and the sadness is for nothing. But the other part me of knows that the test could be positive and if it is, I don\u2019t know if im ready to hear those words. \n\nI constantly worry about the future. My biggest worry about finding out, is that I\u2019ll hurt the people I love. Every time I think about my future husband taking care of me and how hard it will be, I break down. I don\u2019t want people to take sacrifices in their own life to take care of me. \n\nI started dating a guy and we\u2019ve dating for around 9 months. I know I\u2019m young and probably a little dumb but I love him more than I\u2019ve loved anyone before. He\u2019s amazing and perfect and so kind to me. He knows about my chances of getting HD but I don\u2019t think he fully understands what it really means. Part of me feels bad for putting him in this situation and telling him in the first place, because after all, we are only 18. When I told him, he cried almost for a whole day. He couldn\u2019t even look at me without crying.

All I can say is I do not have a super early onset due to my age and good health so far.\n\nMy primary concerns are twofold:\n1) I want to take the test anonymously with cash due to insurance concerns.\n2) I only want my mother to know about this until I have a result. No significant other, no friends, no other family. \n\nI\u2019m in Los Angeles - has anyone taken the test anonymously and can recommend a path forward?  \n\nI am also aware that hiding an HD diagnosis is fraudulent regarding life insurance - curious if anyone has feedback on this aspect regarding regular health insurance.  I do not ever intend to get life insurance unless I test negative, but I am concerned about a positive test making it harder to get or maintain health insurance / longevity of pre-existing condition protections.\n\nThanks.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 667, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help me take the next step", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1560390481, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/bz7rsw/help_me_take_the_next_step/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "uwstudentresearcher", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3x85vo19", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1560200357, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/bz38gi/hd_and_depression_studentrun_research/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bz38gi", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/bz38gi/hd_and_depression_studentrun_research/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "e8W4-wR6SOUDljLxC5aLkc93bYZZrX7H-fzCuyTfKq4", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/NB5ioHSoGPHYnx0xgEtQikGHkYGoSti0xULbSHkBN70.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29416598b76b694be509a77641f2808beea913aa", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/NB5ioHSoGPHYnx0xgEtQikGHkYGoSti0xULbSHkBN70.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0453bc89984212c47ca897feb47f7f6c4b2803ed", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/NB5ioHSoGPHYnx0xgEtQikGHkYGoSti0xULbSHkBN70.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dddd95433bb751e9803ee882d964ac3946ceb345", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/NB5ioHSoGPHYnx0xgEtQikGHkYGoSti0xULbSHkBN70.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e93b2d7f87a36247350033c02d6232a47b491058", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/NB5ioHSoGPHYnx0xgEtQikGHkYGoSti0xULbSHkBN70.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=309b480975624fffaf0d81c75544afb8629ca268", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/NB5ioHSoGPHYnx0xgEtQikGHkYGoSti0xULbSHkBN70.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b902bb787b8b12eb14a61762212894efc67119f1", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/NB5ioHSoGPHYnx0xgEtQikGHkYGoSti0xULbSHkBN70.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=893fd1ee42574477e1265936cc332fd497deb0f2", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1560200358, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hello all!

Even if these websites don't test for HD (or release medical data because it's against FDA regulations), they could store the data. Government agencies are already accessing the genetic information to solve cold cases through genome mapping --- the Golden State Killer was identified because his distant cousin submitted DNA to 23andme. What if medical insurance/credit agencies are given access to the store genetic data? Even if the genetic material wasn't supplying the HD documentation, public death records in the family trees could point to what living family members could possibly have HD. It's possible that we specifically all share a common ancestor, way, way, back. 10 million Americans have already submitted DNA and there's a projection that by 2021, 90% of Americans will be able to be identified through genome mapping even if they haven't submitted their own DNA. it's estimated that around 800 people typically share a third grandfather and that only 1 or 2 people in that familial group need to submit their DNA for everyone in the group's DNA to be able to be known. The commodification of DNA and genetic data is already dystopic enough on its own --- but even more so when dealing with a fatal hereditary disease. Even if only a handful of us were to submit DNA to a database, it could be possible to determine *everyone* who carries the disease (and might carry the disease).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I first started getting support for HD (thank you everyone here for helping me), the most common advice I got was to avoid having anything on my medical record that states I have HD. I don't know yet because I haven't been tested.

I feel like I've got an ok-grasp on dementia and elderly people, I have about 5 years experience. But I recently started with my first HD client about 2 months ago and I have no clue what I'm doing. \n\nFirst off, she's about my age, mid 30s. She was diagnosed 5 years ago. Her father had it, he passed at 49 and his mother had it, her mother had it and so on. She lives in an assisted living facility and it's not the best. That's another story in itself. My first thought was to be more of her friend since we're almost the same age. I don't want to be an authority...but maybe that's the wrong approach?\n\nThe thing I'm struggling with the most is the apathy. She's glued to her phone and wants to do little else. Getting her off the couch is really hard. She just doesn't want to. Almost never wants to shower. Recently went 5 days without one.

He\u2019s never said anything about this to me, and he\u2019s never mentioned the occupational therapy.\n\nAt first, I wondered if this was a mistake.

The study also made me realize I have been having symptoms for the past 2 years or so (depression, anxiety, inability to focus, forgetting things I shouldn't be, twitching, etc). Since this realization, I have been trying to hide it from my mom and sisters but it's getting harder and they are starting to notice. My grades are slipping, the twitching/fidgeting is getting worse, and I can't even remember the last time I slept more than 5 hours. I want to get to tested to know if have it or not, but I'm not sure if I should wait and see if the symptoms actually get worse.

My Dad and I haven't had the best relationship due to his drug and alcohol abuse and absence after him and my Mom separated, leaving her to succumb to HD and then almost letting my brothers and I end up in foster care. Luckily his parents took us in when my Mom couldn't care for us anymore. \n\nI got pregnant with my oldest son when I was 17. My Paternal Grandma at the time suggested an abortion because I was young. And also mentioned I hadn't been tested for HD; being optimistic and naive at 17 I didn't even take that into account. \n\nA few years later as my Mom was getting worse and my family and I were trying to get her into assisted living. She had some friends that weren't the best one including an old friend from high school. Her and I had a conversation in my Mom's driveway about HD, her health etc. She brought up how my brothers and I \"were all postive\". At the time I was just like \"I don't know we haven't been tested\". And brushed it off as my Mom feeling guilty and being delusional. \n\nWell now when I told my Dad about my status the first thing he texts me back is :\n\n\"Well we kind of knew you had it all three of you do \ud83d\ude15\"\n\nTo which I replied \"What do you mean you knew we all had it?\" \n\nHe back tracked and said \"No I mean we all know your Mom had it\"\n\nHe can be socially awkward, and honestly just plain dumb at times. So I don't know if he just made a mistake (he also uses text to talk). \n\nBut now I am wondering if my whole family knew I was positive this entire time. \n\nAnd if they did... What. The. Fuck. \n\nThey should have told me. I wouldn't have been so naive if I knew I was for sure positive. I would have had my tubes tied. I LOVE my children, so much. And I already feel guilty enough as is. But now I find out this? My Dad brushed my question off and I was trying to stick to my postive outlook and didn't want to dredge that up. \n\nBut now I just don't know. Is it a weird coincidence that my Mom thought that and my Dad made this mistake of words. Or did he just slip up? I think I should probably confront him. I am the oldest sibling and I was born in 1990, did they do prenatal screening for HD back then?

How you allow that energy to manifest is a different subject altogether but there is no doubt that living at risk brings an intensity to life that some people will never find.  I am a 34 yoa male at risk and try to keep in mind that the flip side of the coin is that i havent taken a day for granted in quite some time. As a teenager the energy was expressed as anger and i hated the sensitivity and intensity that came with it. I see now as an adult that people who are really struggling in life are lacking a connection and become somewhat apathetic. So when the spirit is strong and seems to be overwhelming, appreciate that you are still able to feel because some people are just going through the motions every day with no driving force. Also know that if you are under 40, You are a pioneer of discovery as no person before you has had the ability to be the executor of their own philosophical conundrum. If i tested negative tomorrow, would i lose my edge and become complacent like so many others out wandering aimlessly? Who knows?

I love him dearly. A few years ago we found out that his dad had Huntington\u2019s. He told me but his dad wasn\u2019t overly symptomatic so I didn\u2019t really think about it. I didn\u2019t entirely know what it was and just thought when he was older he\u2019d basically have Alzheimer\u2019s but that would be far away. Maybe 2 years ago we talked about it more and I researched how bad the disease is. That\u2019s when I started realizing him much trouble my boyfriend was in. Throughout the next year I worried about it and we slightly talked about how we would want him to get tested before we had kids. (We\u2019ve known since we were 18 or 19 that we\u2019re getting married one day). Then last Year he was tested and tested positive for the disease with 44 repeats. It was terrible and 3 days after telling me that he broke up with me. I was heartbroken and my world was shattered. At the time he said that he didn\u2019t want to ever get married or have kids or live a life with someone. We spent a year apart but talked a few times and in the last 4 months or so have decided to get back together. He says that he wanted to give me an out and that breaking up with me was to make sure I knew I could leave and wouldn\u2019t feel trapped. I understand his logic but it still was traumatizing. I feel so guilty for being hurt though because I don\u2019t even have the disease. I\u2019m not supposed to be the one that\u2019s upset and depressed.. i want to be supportive and strong but I\u2019m more emotional than him. I love him with everything and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I want to spend the rest of whatever time we have left with each other. My family knows everything and we\u2019re very close and I also feel like they think I\u2019m throwing my life away because it\u2019s going to be a long hard life with him and We probably shouldn\u2019t have kids. I\u2019ve always wanted kids and I feel confident in my ability to be a really good parent and people have always said that. I know there\u2019s other options like IVF or foster or adoption but they are expensive and I don\u2019t want them to grow up to love their dad and then he dies a long and painful death. I just feel alone and literally no one in my life understands. I try not to bring it up with him either cause I don\u2019t want to hog all the emotional drama when he is so nonchalant and level headed about the future. Granted he was a mess when we were broken up, he seems so collected when it comes to his diagnosis. \n\nSorry this is a long and unstructured rant, I just could really use some words and reassurance that others are going through this.

I have a few questions about HD potentially running in my partners family. We are considering starting a family in the coming years, and wanted to get insight/input on testing, HD, and the like. Here\u2019s the background.\n\nMy partner\u2019s mother passed when she was 53. Due to her insurance situation they could never afford a true autopsy, but it is believed she suffered a heart attack or event at the top of the stairs while home alone. Prior to passing, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depression, and had issues with a very ever so slight shaking leg described as hardly noticeable but potentially present. She also suffered from communication troubles in terms of relating and relaying information, as well as social filter and inhibition was impacted in more minor ways, with a few instances of it seeming to be a significant problem at the time. \n\nMy partner\u2019s uncle passed at 64. He had suffered from severe and vivid mania, depression, and hallucinations. He may have also had a shaky leg, but it was assumed he did that because of hyperactivity and anxiety. He was checked into the hospital due to the severe hallucinations, and had an allergic reaction to medication administered there, eventually being told by doctors it appeared to be some kind of Alzheimer\u2019s, though no true solid diagnosis was given. The allergic reaction to the medication caused him to stop eating and he declined over the course of a short period and passed. \n\nMy partner\u2019s grandmother passed from a major heart attack event in her early 50s, and showed signs of depression, though that is all really known up to that point in family lineage. \n\nMy partner\u2019s cousin has had a history of severe mental illness since adolescence due to multiple forms of abuse, and is in her 30s now. Over the last 20 years she has had diagnosis and treatments for depression, anxiety, OCD, Bipolar, and most recently autism spectrum disorder. She appears in good health, but recently her recall of events has been conflating truth and facts with fictional recollections of events, only on specific minor details. \n\nNo one in the family has ever received an HD diagnosis, and we don\u2019t believe anyone has been tested for HD. Me being me, the anxiety has sent me spiraling connecting these dots, and even has gone as far as to consume me over the last few days. We are considering starting a family and do not know whether testing is viable or necessary, or if this truly is something else other than HD. \n\nThe other key piece is my partner and sister in law saved their mother\u2019s hair to one day have it genetically tested. They were young and without enough money to do testing, but have intentions of one day doing so with their mother\u2019s hair. \n\nIn your personal opinions, what can or should we do? Does this sound like an HD lineage? I understand there will be no Reddit diagnosing, this is more personal experience and analyzing our situation and giving input on your own experiences. Is testing really worth it? This has been so much.

She is 27, and has been showing symptoms for a couple years, but was not able to get diagnosed because my family has no history of HD. She was actually initially diagnosed with MS, but as her symptoms changed they decided to test for HD to \"cross their t's and dot their i's\" not expecting a positive result because of our lack of family history. The youngest age of death of any of my grandparents was 79 (died of glioblastoma, other three lived into their 90s), my parents are currently in their 60s with no symptoms, and no aunts/uncles/cousins have shown any symptoms at all. \n\nWe got my sisters diagnosis 4 days ago. It feels like I was hit by a train. My younger sister and I are very close, and her progressive, previously undiagnosed illness has been very hard on me, my other two sisters, and my parents. In the last 6 months it feels like it has really ramped up, with her now showing some cognitive loss and her motor function really decreasing (now recognized as very textbook chorea form movements). And to find out for sure what it is and that she isn't ever going to get better is hard enough, but now I may eventually go through the same thing.\n\nMy two older sisters (32 and 31) have both already gotten their blood drawn to be tested and so have my two parents. I (29) just had cancer genetic screening done a couple months ago, so I was able to talk with my genetic counselor a couple days ago and was referred to the HD center near me and am in the process of setting up an appointment. I thankfully already have life insurance and I'm trying to not make a knee jerk decision to get tested before speaking to an HD expert since I can't un-know the result.\n\nBut right now it's just so hard. I'm sad about my sister and I feel like my future is gone. I know that it might not be, but I am a very future oriented person and my wife and I were planning on starting our family at the end of next year. I can't stop myself from thinking of all the things in my future children's lives that I may miss, and leaving my wife behind. We are celebrating our first wedding anniversary this year. It feels disingenuous to hope or dream of the future anymore, because it may all be gone.\n\nI'm sorry if this is too dark, I'm just really lost right now. I haven't been able to find a lot on people who have no family history at all of HD. I'm not sure how to get through everyday without dwelling on all of these feelings of loss.

I recently read about Huntingdon's and am concerned that my boyfriend should seek out a neurologist.  Last July (2019), he was going through some depression and anxiety and quit his job.  He was having an increasingly difficult time getting along with other people and had a lot of apathy towards work and life in general. It was causing him stress and major depression. We met in October of that year via a mutual friend. At that time my friend who has know him for years, mentioned that he can be frequently moody, which I have experienced myself over the course of the year. A year ago, I noticed that he was developing a tic. it was just a eye blink at the time. Which we chalked up to all the stress/anxiety. He was having trouble going out in public, even things like the grocery store were difficult and unmanageable for him. Over the course of the year the tic has progressed, from just a eye blink, to a shoulder shrug, to some small arm and torso movement, and also now a vocal sneeze or tsk like sound that is present as well. The tics have gotten worse and been present for over a year now, and he is starting to get frustrated by them. He has no history of tics or anything similar in his childhood. He is 35, so they first showed up last year.\n\nOne of the factors that caused him to leave his career as software developer was that he having trouble keeping up with learning new things and changes. Although he reports that he has never done well with change. Shortly after leaving a friend offered him some temp work on a project, but he had a anxiety/panic attack because he couldn't face learning something new and downloading the various things he would need. A couple of months ago he got a job, working for a small company that was using older technology, that he felt we knew really well and therefore would not have to learn anything new. But he had to quit a few days ago because we was frustrated and anxious at not being able to solve the coding problems, something he previously excelled at. It came very easily to him before.\n\nUnfortunately his personality has become little abrasive and  as a result he has lost touch with all most all his friends this year. He personality has changed quite a bit, and he generally has apathy towards  most things, and became very conspiracy minded. He used to be quite social. He isn't currently speaking to his parents.\n\nI have being getting increasingly concerned about the tics, and in researching them realized tics in adulthood are rarer. Which is when I came across Huntingdon's. He doesn't have any obvious family history that we know, but he also doesn't know a whole lot about his extended family. His dad has restless leg syndrome and some other things that I think are depression or something that he takes medication for. I do not know specifically what for. But  I do know that something was going on with his dad at the same age. When he was in his mid 30's, he had some kind of \"mental breakdown\" that led to him being hospitalized and he has seen a counselor/psychiatrist and medicated ever since.  His dad's personality completely changed and as a result he his very reluctant to see anyone or doctors that might medicate him, as he doesn't want to be like his dad.\n\nI am working on figuring out how to get  him to see a doctor as he has no insurance or income and hasn't been to a doctor in about 10 years or more. He is also pretty paranoid and resistant to wearing a mask.\n\nI know only seeing neurologist can give specific answers. But I am wondering if any of this lines up with other peoples experience of Huntingdon's? Sometimes when seeking answers for things it's easy to just see symptoms or circumstances that could fit everywhere. I know it could be many things. But since I am essentially the only person in his life this feels very overwhelming.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1033, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Not sure of where to begin", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/jcbqgu/not_sure_of_where_to_begin/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "twolasagnas", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_262fg338", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1602702980, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/jb7ear/questions_about_huntingtons/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jb7ear", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/jb7ear/questions_about_huntingtons/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1602702991, "score": 1, "selftext": "My (23) mother (52) was just diagnosed with Huntington\u2019s yesterday. For the last year and a half, I and other family members have noticed a slight decline in her mental state, including bad memory, confusion, and clumsiness. After convincing the rest of the family to encourage her to see a doctor, she finally stopped being stubborn and consulted with a neurologist starting about a month ago. Yesterday she received confirmation that she has Huntington\u2019s via tests sent to the Mayo clinic by the neurologist. \n\nThese are some of my questions that a simple google search can\u2019t help me answer: \n\nWhen is the right time to tell my mother she can no longer drive? She drives my very younger brother to school everyday and he has noticed times where she wasn\u2019t driving right. \n\nHow should my siblings and I go about getting tested? Should we go to our regular doctors and consult or should we get anonymous tests?\n\nIf it turns out that me or any of my siblings do test positive in the predictive tests, what does that mean for our lives if we don\u2019t have symptoms? Do we keep working to build up our futures or do we go on disability or something? \n\nFinally, my younger brother (9) is the only one in the family we haven\u2019t told. Is this a good idea? We don\u2019t want him to be preoccupied with what\u2019s going on, but I know eventually he will see his mother\u2019s decline and know that something is happening. Does he have a right to know or when is the best time to tell a child this? \n\nI\u2019m sorry if some of these questions come off as ignorant or misinformed. I had heard of Huntington\u2019s before and knew a little about it, but most of what I know has been learned in the last 24 hours. \n\nThank you to anyone who takes the time to answer any of these questions.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1031, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Questions about Huntington\u2019s", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/jb7ear/questions_about_huntingtons/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SkatayG", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9xvwa", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1602555659, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/ja4p5t/anonymous_testing/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ja4p5t", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/ja4p5t/anonymous_testing/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1602555670, "score": 1, "selftext": "Does anyone know where someone could get tested for HD anonymously, for example using a pseudonym?

She was diagnosed unusually late but if we're honest with ourselves the symptoms had been there for a long time. Her brothers had both died from huntingtons many years earlier [one from suicide].  \nMy father is her son. Then there's me, and my sister.  From what I know, age at onset is similar when inherited from mother to child, therefore it is likely my father would start showing symptoms [if he has the gene] late like her.  However there is anticipation when inherited from a father, therefore if my sister or I have it, our onset would be younger.  \nI've known about the huntingtons for a long time. My father has never had any interest in getting tested, I think he's horribly afraid and he is a very timid man. I am not about to push him into something he doesn't want to do.  I personally believe for a few years now he has been showing symptoms.  \nHowever, this means that I cannot get tested. Even if I would be allowed by the health service, if I came up positive I would also know my dad's diagnosis before he did, and when he did not want to know. That is a weight I do not want to carry on my shoulders.  \nHowever, I think I'm ruining my life based on the possibility I have HD. If I test + I am not having children biological, adopted, whatever. I do not wish to die in their childhoods.\nBut because I cannot test, I am acting like I do have it. E.g. even though I LOVE children, I will not date a man who wants kids because of that 25% chance, which obviously sabotages my ability to have kids even if negative. I am struggling to plan for my future, my life feels so short etc etc. But there's a 75% chance this doesn't apply to me and I'm maybe making decisions I'll regret.\n\n\n\nI don't know, just needed to vent.\nTo top it off, I haven't talked to my family since February. My mother spread private medical information of mine around the family after I had confided in her, and instructed her that she was not to tell anyone, very clearly. She then told absolutely everyone and made a reference to it at a dinner which everyone clearly understood, cousins, aunts etc. When later confronted she did not apologise and felt that she was allowed to tell anyone she wanted. She then used huntingtons as a weapon and asked \"Aren't you glad I told you about grandma's huntingtons?\" So did she spread that too? It's not even her side of the family. She used it again as a weapon in a later conversation and I cannot forgive her and have not talked to her since. She doesn't seem to \"get it\".

All of my relatives thought that her family had a history of \u2018pagal\u2019 (crazy) people (I don\u2019t mean to be offensive) who would develop a lot of diseases later in their lives. A few of my relatives also had the audacity to ask my dad to consider leaving my mom because my mom would also possibly suffer my grandmother\u2019s fate. \n\n\nA few years later, my mom stared showing symptoms and my dad immediately took us to a neurologist in Bangalore. Just after looking at my mom\u2019s symptoms, he asked her to tested for HD. After my mom\u2019s tested positive, the doctor asked me to get tested too. Results? 44 repeats.\n\nI was 20 when I got tested. I had worked really hard the past couple of years to top my school in the grade 10 public examination and then go on to an international school and complete IB. I had just started studying at an university abroad. My life had completely turned around from the small-town boy and I was having the best time of my life. \n\nAnd then the results hit me. I wasn\u2019t able to process what it meant at first. I would just google the disease and read about it until I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. The last two years in college, all I could think about was whether it was worth doing it at all. Whether I could pursue a masters or a phd without loosing all my time studying. Would it be better to just go home and help my mom and dad dealing with all of this? How long until severe symptoms hit me too? Will it impact my performance in exams? There were so many questions with very few answers. I became very depressed, alone, and messed up most of my courses the next few semesters.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, I promised myself to feel better and do things like everything\u2019s okay. And that the symptoms will come when it comes, I can\u2019t do anything about it. Even though 2020 has been the worst year, I have grown a lot this year. I just graduated college (getting into the Dean\u2019s list in my final semester). I came back home and am helping my parents in their business. I\u2019m still looking for opportunities to work abroad. Also submitted an application for pursuing an mphil. I am still constantly reminded of my result but I make sure that I don\u2019t get upset about it. \n\nI\u2019m not on social media a lot and I just found out about this community and wanted to share.

We have been together for 10 years, and I have always known it was a real possibility we could face this disease some day.\n\nI always said I would never ever pressure him one way or the other to get tested. I do not live with this struggle day to day. I don\u2019t know what it is like. No matter what, I will be there and will support his decision. It is a difficult subject to bring up because I don\u2019t feel it is my place. In addition, we have always talked about children - but knowing he has the possibility of having HD has not changed how he has talked to me about our future. He gets very excited, and frequently says \u201cour kids one day will.....\u201d or \u201cwhen we\u2019re parents we....\u201d\n\nI think this type of talk has made me very comfortable thinking of having children, and has allowed both of us to kind of sweep reality under the rug.

For not the first time, I have suggested genetic counseling and starting to find a doctor we mesh well with and who we can trust. I have suggested looking into life insurance and long term care. I really don\u2019t want it to feel like I am pushing him, but rather I am trying to support.

Sorry if it\u2019s long: it\u2019s all a bit of a vent.\n\nMyself and my partner were going to start trying for a baby during lockdown after our first home purchase fell through. Later that week, we had news that Huntington\u2019s \u2018might\u2019 be in the family which came about after my dad going through neurology appointments for stroke-like symptoms (slurring speech, choking, stumbling, some cognitive slips)\n\nI pushed through my concerns about Huntington\u2019s. I will not ethically have children until I can rule this out. My family initially assumed I was being overly sensitive, but I\u2019m glad I persevered with relaying my concerns. At this time, my only thought was my future children. I\u2019m the wrong side of 35  so the last thing we want is to delay this. It\u2019s disappointing, but the right thing to do.\n\nMoving onto this week, I moved into my new (future family) home on Wednesday with my partner. The sad news is that the day before, my dad was confirmed as having full penetrance Huntington\u2019s. I was really hoping having gotten to his 70\u2019s he most likely had a stroke.\n\nI feel rubbish that the first day of the rest of mine and my partners life started with the news that it might not be for as long as we\u2019d hoped. \n\nI feel angry. I\u2019m concerned about my partner and being a burden to him and our hopeful kids. Im angry that I have to put that on hold when we\u2019re not so young any more. I\u2019m concerned for my siblings. At least one of us statistically will have it, though I hope it\u2019s none of us. \n\nThere\u2019s so much going through my mind right now. I\u2019m trying so hard to focus on the house and the excitement, but the reality of what we may have to face creeps in as the initial excitement wears off.\n\nIt\u2019s like a fog that creeps in. I bat it away, and it dissipates for a short while. Eventually, the fog creeps in with increasing frequency. I expect it won\u2019t go away until I know what my result is. What does batting your hand do against the fog anyway? The fog is just there right? It\u2019s just a matter of fact that it\u2019s either there or not there. It\u2019s just fact. It\u2019s either or. I\u2019m either going to have to deal with this or I\u2019m not. But what I do know, is that it feels like a trauma even having to question whether it\u2019s a thing.\n\nI\u2019m ok this week, but I feel like I\u2019m riding on the new house adrenaline. What will happen next week when I\u2019m back at work and don\u2019t see the point of it until I can digest the gravity of a shortened and not very nice end of life? It seems a lot to deal with.\n\nI understand there is a 50/50. I feel angry that the choice (if positive) will be \u2018this will take you out slowly and cruelly assuming nothing else does.\u2019 It means it\u2019s the best I can hope for. Or if I\u2019m clear, I can expect it\u2019ll be likely for a sibling to have to experience this instead. I\u2019ve spent since my teens struggling with depression and anxiety to varying extents. I finally feel like I\u2019ve got a handle on it and this is what happens? It just doesn\u2019t seem fair.\n\nI feel sad that my partner has cried too. He feels like he can\u2019t protect me. What can I do apart from give him the option to leave if he wants to? It\u2019s not what he signed up for. He doesn\u2019t want to leave, however, and would choose to have no children if it meant a fuller life together. I\u2019d like children, but even with IVF I\u2019d be aware of burdening teens with a potentially sick mother. It\u2019s not a choice they\u2019d have. I\u2019ve suggested we both get counselling, and that he also he involved in the genetic councelling at every step. He is as impacted by this as much as I am. \n\nI\u2019m not the kind of person that can ignore this. Thinking positive didn\u2019t help my dads results, so the only way is a harsh reality of what may or may not be. It\u2019s blunt, it\u2019s harsh, but those are the cards I\u2019ve been dealt right? All those unknowns. I\u2019m just in between right now. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m asking right now. It\u2019s probably too fresh to collate into questions. \n\n I know I want to get tested for the sake of my family, and for the sake of my own mind. I don\u2019t want the stress of wondering if every small blip is a sign of Huntington\u2019s.\n\nI get the 50/50, and I get the clear benefits of councelling. I also feel like the odds are the odds, and nothing changes that except for my own decision to worry or to make the most of things. I\u2019ll choose to make the most of it soon I\u2019m sure. I WILL be ok no matter what. That I can be sure of, because my previous mental health experiences have set me up to be stronger and more resilient.\n\nI suppose if I could ask anything:\nIs there anyone that can share with me how they felt during the initial discovery and subsequent \u2018unknown\u2019 time? I expect this is all completely normal, and I hold no guilt over how I feel right now. \n\nThanks for listening!

It incorporates science (a lot of it) plus I have to ability to care and treat patients to hopefully improve their life or to lead someone on the right track to get better/healthier. After finding out from all my biology classes that HD has a 50% chance of passing onto offspring, I was terrified and devastated. The journey to becoming a doctor is long. 4 years of college. 4 years of medical school. 3-4 years of residency. 2-7 years optional fellowship. This adds up, and as someone that is at risk, I would hate to have spent my youth studying medicine to not even be able to practice it. My parent passing away from HD has driven me even more to pursue medicine- I am fairly optimistic but I want to treat patients with HD (as well as other neurodegenerative diseases) and want to work with researchers/scientists to find more treatments and possibly the cure to HD.

She can SEE them all around her and will even point to where she is being bitten at that moment (no bug is there).  We have done stuff like change out her soap, bought different sheets, gave her a spray bottle of aloe, bought new clothes / pajamas, benadryl,  etc.  It is in her head and nothing we do seems to help (mentally or physically). She says they are in her clothes and can see them clearly on the bed.  She was caught trying to set the bed on fire due to the bugs..  No one else is itching or sees bugs.  There are no bug bites on her.  There WAS a small knat (fruit fly) issue in the kitchen due to a forgotten potato but it wasn't an issue for long. I feel like that was the trigger but there was a minor change in medication @ the same time (same generic med but the color changed and shape changed - dont know why).  The lady that cleans the house does not see bugs.  \n\nYall don't know how much I truly wish there are bugs in the house and not my mom losing her mind.  I wish we had the biggest bug problem the world has ever seen. I want to put bugs in the house just to make it true.\n\n\"The bugs\" is all she talks about and it is breaking my heart. I have explained that this is in her head too many times to count.  She understands what I am saying but cannot reconcile that with the fact that she can see them and feel their bite.\n\nShe has expressed the desire to end her life due to the stress and anxiety so I hid the knives and dad hid the gun. She isn't very mobile but has tried to go outside unsupervised. She sees her HD DR in Memphis regularly and a DR local to her in Tupelo.  She is on several meds and we trust the DR to make the correct pharmaceutical decisions. I suggested he increase the frequency of the Klonopin for anxiety. She begs us for it @ 4 PM when she knows she can't take it until 7PM. We have to tell her \"no\" for 3 hours but it is a break from talking about the bugs.  Dr added something for the hallucinations an blaming it on HD.  The med has not helped (yet)..  \n\nI am going to continue to do my piece and think up ways to things she can do to \"fight the bite\" (spray bottle, lotion, ice pack, cortisone, etc).  I hope that I am not encouraging bad behavior.  We never pretend tbe bugs are real but also never minimize her situation or that she can feel them bitingher.  Anything driving a person to suicide must be taken seriously. \n\nIs this normal?  What am I missing?  Has anyone had to deal with it?  Is it a phase? Will it get worse? Will I lose hope?  What tricks can I try?  What are some good distractions for hallucinations? Should I play along with the hallucinations?  Will she ever \"get it\" that this is in her head?  If I could fix the bug bite problem, we could go back to a semi-normal life.  Life would be good.\n\nI need help.

I am a 23-year-old female looking for advice and perspectives on getting tested. I knew our family had a history of Huntington\u2019s, but I honestly thought it was more of a distant history than it actually is. We were talking about Huntington\u2019s Disease yesterday in class, and I called my Dad about it and learned all the details. \n\nI included a visual of my Dad\u2019s side to hopefully help (the ones in squares had/have Huntington\u2019s). Huntington\u2019s affects men and women differently in our family. My great-great grandma and my great aunt experienced severe physical symptoms earlier in life. Neither of them had cognitive issues, so it affected them more physically than mentally. I believe they both lived to relatively old ages. The men in my family normally don\u2019t experience symptoms until late in life, and it is usually hand shaking. This excludes my Dad\u2019s cousin, who has had minimal symptoms (occasional tremors) for the past 20 years. He frequently uses marijauna, so we wonder if that has kept his symptoms at bay. Anyway, my Dad says Papa\u2019s hand shaking is just like Papa\u2019s dad, so it\u2019s possible that he also has Huntington\u2019s. Basically, I\u2019m concerned the situation that happened with my great grandpa and his daughter (great aunt) will happen with my Dad and I. \n\nWith the men developing symptoms later in life and the women developing them sooner, there\u2019s really no heads-up for me. I understand why Papa and Dad have not gotten tested, since there\u2019s not a lot you can do about the diagnosis. However, the pattern in my family suggests that I may have less time before symptoms appear, if I have the gene. \n\nPart of me does not want to know, but the logical part of me thinks I probably should. If I have it, maybe I should do as much as I can before symptoms start. However, knowing that symptoms will inevitably start would be hard. Should I maintain hope that I don\u2019t have it and continue living my life? Or figure it out and live accordingly? There\u2019s always the chance that I don\u2019t have the gene, and I would feel relieved knowing that. My husband and I have been together for 6 years and recently got married, and he\u2019s supportive no matter what happens. He\u2019s a nurse currently working in mental health and understands what could happen. I don\u2019t want him to have to be a nurse both at work and at home. We are not ready for kids right now, but it is something we have talked about. So, that is something to take into consideration as well.\n\nSorry for the long post! Thank you if you have read it through. I am looking for any advice or perspectives, because I am not sure what to think right now. I understand this has to be my own decision, but any thoughts would be helpful! Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note: Because the men in my family do not experience symptoms until later in life, they have all agreed to give their bodies to science for research purposes.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 969, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for advice after learning of our family's unusual Huntington's history", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/i1bsb9/looking_for_advice_after_learning_of_our_familys/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "wellvis", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6mps2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1596158692, "domain": "app.donorview.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/i0yihe/stems_virtual_wine_tasting_benefit_for_hdsa/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i0yihe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/i0yihe/stems_virtual_wine_tasting_benefit_for_hdsa/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1596158703, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 966, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Stems Virtual Wine tasting (benefit for HDSA Pacific Region) August 16th", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://app.donorview.com/Event/EventInfo?prm=tqITQp5N0w3BYK94HwsDgB1WosiCtMQprdkQ_yrGx2fJMJ-MHmXx2ZGQ8DNYz-ID95O7AnDE0R-1zUQD0mvQFQ_NKHNEzi1X7SqAthLR9N9adpRQno-d2tak-wR7t1o6HDqp5uTfwpMN0jg8Mt2OJEIrOJqXS-VJsJbE0jSlVLrAggfa-8uNDuH1s0qxPLOoCWY6hRolJQrC-8goGVlRywUJw-R4VKHPC7EOingEz6k1mhMX4g4gfQPyPP8HTc340", "url_overridden_by_dest": "https://app.donorview.com/Event/EventInfo?prm=tqITQp5N0w3BYK94HwsDgB1WosiCtMQprdkQ_yrGx2fJMJ-MHmXx2ZGQ8DNYz-ID95O7AnDE0R-1zUQD0mvQFQ_NKHNEzi1X7SqAthLR9N9adpRQno-d2tak-wR7t1o6HDqp5uTfwpMN0jg8Mt2OJEIrOJqXS-VJsJbE0jSlVLrAggfa-8uNDuH1s0qxPLOoCWY6hRolJQrC-8goGVlRywUJw-R4VKHPC7EOingEz6k1mhMX4g4gfQPyPP8HTc340"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mlportersr", "author_cakeday": true, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_zv0x0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595878064, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/hyz0aw/for_the_men_folk/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hyz0aw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/hyz0aw/for_the_men_folk/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1595878078, "score": 1, "selftext": "Reaching Out in Love \u2013 Chapter 37, Women traditionally are seen as the one who bear the bulk of the caregiving chores.

Quite a bit of my life before the last few years too.  \n\nI started having dystonia in my toes about a year ago.  Last month I started having full body movements.  It's kind of a circular pattern of involuntary twisting and clenching.\n\nSo I got into see the movement specialist neurologist in my area.  He talked to me for about an hour and then said he wanted to have me tested for Huntington's Disease.\n\nThere is no HD in my family and I'd never heard of it before.... I'm just overwhelmed.    \nI kinda think I have this.. I have been struggling so hard for so long.  I've always just thought it is something I need to push through, even though I've been sucking at trying to push through for a while.\n\nI'm also afraid that I won't test positive and then I'm just feeling sorry for myself and comparing myself to people who are truly suffering from one of the worst things ever.   Of course I don't want to test positive, but it would answer a lot of things about my life.\n\nIt is so unusual to have a random mutation I feel it is very very unlikely that I will be positive.  But my neurologist didn't give any other probabilities.  Currently I'm waiting for them to negotiate the cost of the test with my insurance (US), so I haven't even had blood drawn yet.\n\nBecause of COVID19 I had to go to my neurology appointment alone, and I'll have to go get this test alone too.  My friends and family aren't super helpful despite their good intentions anyways, they're all too busy saying \"you don't have this!\"\n\nI don't know how this is going to impact my life.. I currently live alone, have a small business, am the treasurer for a volunteer organization, and have been completely independent since I can remember. I can tell that my organization and memory has gone downhill over the past decade.  I'm almost 40.  I have had trouble with all relationships and I'd say that my emotions feel as jerky as my movement.  I show too much affection and then don't follow through.  I've done a lot of work to resolve resentments and to forgive.. but I still struggle with relationships.\n\nBesides the movement, I look extremely healthy.  Exercise has been a big escape and therapy for me.  I ride my bike sometimes hours a day.  I practice hours of yoga everyday to soften my stiffness and it helps a lot.  I am stronger and more fit than I have been for most of my life.  I've been pushing myself so hard.  I've been maintaining strict diets and tried extreme elimination diets looking for allergies or sensitivities..  I look super fit but I still feel like shit.\n\nI don't know how to wrap this up.  I don't have a final conclusion.

I\u2019ve met her a couple times only, so I don\u2019t know much.\n\nThe thing is, my gf started showing symptoms of some sort of hypomania, there are days in which she wants to do nothing, then all of a sudden she starts doing lots of stuff, gets bored and leaves them half done. She fluctuates between easily irritated to lethargic to euphoric, these variations are from day to day or take a couple days to change. Talking to my therapist about how it affects me has led him to think she may be experiencing something similar to hypomania (I never mentioned HD to him so far).\n\nOther than that, she has restless legs, which makes it difficult to sleep together, as I have very light sleep and the way she moves her legs is basically up and down, banging on the mattress every minute or so.\n\nFor the rest she shows no twitching or any muscle related issues. She started the process to get tested years ago and ultimately decided not to do it, but it\u2019s clear there is this \u201cdark cloud\u201d constantly hovering above her head.\n\nI\u2019m mentioning all of this because it\u2019s greatly affecting me.

We\u2019ve been together for 6 months, give or take and living together  for 2 months now.\n\nI am doing therapy for a while now, started because I wanted to be able to handle these conversations with her better. The easy irritation and fights have been there since the beginning with her, and initially I thought this was a problem with me, maybe cultural differences or improper way of expressing myself. Living together all of this greatly intensified and I\u2019ve tried different approaches, but things keep escalating.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if this is something completely unrelated, or if this hypomania, mood instability is an early symptom of HD?

Admittedly, I don't think anyone in my family has Huntington's but due to some complaints I have been having in the past 6 months or so, I did some googling. \n\nAbout 6 months ago or so, I began to notice a lot of cognitive difficulties, and got a psychoeducational assessment which found executive function difficulties, word finding problems, and poor recall ability. This was new for me, as I was great at school but am having a lot more difficulties, which is why I decided to get tested.\n\nFast forward about two more months, and I have started to notice muscle twitches. They kind of happen randomly all over my whole body. Some are subtle, some are more prominent but nothing too drastic. They mainly happen in large muscles, not like my finger or eyelid. Some repeat quickly over and over, but most just happen once in one spot. Eventually the same spot will twitch again but it's not repetitive, if that makes sense. \n\nI have been looking up potential causes for muscle twitches and I can rule out dehydration and electrolyte issues. I just looked into the symptoms of Huntington's disease today. Of course, google tends to jump to more severe causes, but I guess I am wondering if I should be concerned? I'm sure it's incredibly variable, and I should go see a doctor at least to see what they say, but I guess I just want to know what you all think as well.

I was wondering how people with / with family members with HD navigate managing other health conditions, and cancer screening and dental work. My mom is in probably \u201cmoderate\u201d stage HD,  can still do most things independently, some mobility and speech+swallowing issues. she is otherwise completely healthy and has no other family history or anything. Up until her chorea got worse she did keep up with regular health screening which has never turned up anything. She tried to get a mammogram 5+ years ago but she was moving too much and it didn\u2019t really work and she\u2019s been against getting mammograms and Pap tests since then. She is so ashamed of her chora that she hates leaving the house. She does have a family doctor who we check in with yearly for blood work and a check up but that\u2019s pretty much all she\u2019s willing to do usually. She hasn\u2019t been to the dentist in a few years for sure. \n\nI just feel guilty that I\u2019m not doing more to keep up with this. On the other hand, I don\u2019t even know if she would even want treatment should she have a cancer or something. \n\nI do think a lot of this has to do with my anxiety and issues with excessive guilt about all things to do with my mom but I would love to hear advice and how others have navigated their/ their family member\u2019s health outside of HD. \n\nThank you \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1447, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Managing health outside HD", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/s8o321/managing_health_outside_hd/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "joan_the_vamp_slayer", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ratem", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642524736, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/s71xty/interesting_update_from_the_roche_and_genentech/", "gildings": {}, "id": "s71xty", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/s71xty/interesting_update_from_the_roche_and_genentech/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642524746, "score": 1, "selftext": "[Interesting news](https://hdsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Roche-Genentech-HD-Global-Community-Letter-January-2022.pdf) this morning regarding the Roche and Genentech GENERATION HD1 study. \n\nMy mom was part of the phase IIII trial that was halted, which was a huge blow to us and very sad.

How can anything going on right now with me have nothing to do with HD? It is the single most pervasive thought on my mind.\n\nWill I live a full life? How bad will my symptoms get?

For the past several months I've started getting random tremors more and more, I sometimes get this feeling of weakness in my legs while I'm walking and I've had minor episodes of slurring here and there. Also typing feels \"weird\". \n\nMy family situation is such that I watched my father die from Huntington's complications (he was at 47 counts), I don't have a mother and my grandparents passed away few years after my father passed away. Aside from distant cousins I've only ever heard about, it's really just me. I inherited his house which is where I've been living ever since and I make a good living working doing something I like. None of my friends or coworkers know about my diagnosis and I'm still thinking about what to do now. \n\nAside from Huntington's, I also have other bothersome conditions like irritable bowel disease, some significant skin issues, allergies and an eye condition. I really, really, reaaaalllyy don't want to get to late stage because it's not a pretty sight and there will be no one to look out for me. So my idea is to basically live the rest of my \"livable\" life for as long as I can before coming up with a way to kill myself. Sorry to be this blunt but I don't really have a choice. \n\nI have considerable money saved up, I know my area and I know people. I can concede that what I have in mind is pretty stupid but basically I'll do all drugs, drink all the alcohol and hook up with everyone from Tinder until I feel like I can't go on anymore and somehow OD on cocaine or heroin. If I can't control the disease, I want to at least control my death and that's how I want it to end. Last Saturday I went out with a stranger from Tinder and had sex with him while high on cocaine and it was the most amazing I've ever felt.

I'm sorry if it's not, I just need to talk to some people who might know what I'm going through.\n\nI'm 29, it's hard to get any family history past my grandparents or even for a lot of my parents' generation because they immigrated from a country that didn't have healthcare the way we think of it. I do know my grandpa died pretty young.\n\nI had a seizure at work this past Friday (my eyes would lose focus and my face would go numb, then I'd lose the ability to move, followed by convulsions affecting mostly my right side. I remained conscious the whole time) and ended up in the hospital where I kept having seizures every hour or two through the night. The hospital I was taken to is notoriously shitty, and it's not a surprise that I didn't get a lot of answers there, but they did do a CT scan. The neurologist on call said that there was significant atrophy, but they were unable to determine a cause, or if that was related to my seizures.\n\nMy partner picked me up at 4am and I crashed at their place over the weekend so I could have someone keep an eye on me. I had seizures, periodically, Saturday, Sunday, and today, thought they have been decreasing in severity.\n\nSo all that happened, and I've been thinking back to see if I can remember having neurological symptoms before this. I've had a lot of panic attacks this year that I think might have been seizures, the symptoms being my eyes losing focus and my face going numb, followed by an overwhelming sense of dread and losing the ability to move. My memory is definitely going, but I attributed that to my narcotics problem when I was younger. The hospital neurologist didn't think I was using long enough for there to be that much atrophy. And I've lost vision in my right eye a few times, the earliest I can remember being when I was 25.\n\nBecause this happened over the weekend I've really had nothing to do but stew with it. It took me all day today to get my GP's office to answer their phone and get me a referral to a neurologist. By the time that happened, the neurologist' office was closed. Things are moving so slowly and I just want to scream. I really really really need to have some answers.\n\nLike, I feel like I have to come to terms with the possibility that whatever I have is going to slowly kill me, and no one around me is taking that seriously. Like, the best case scenario for this is I have permanent brain-damage from some unknown cause that's going to cause major neurological symptoms for the rest of my life. And the worst case scenario is I have a degenerative disorder and I'm going to die.\n\nAnyway, that's what I wanted to say.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1418, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A really shitty weekend", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/rg2b7p/a_really_shitty_weekend/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bookyshorty", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_h9llzt1h", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1639403678, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/rfg8jz/is_there_a_way_to_skip_all_of_these_genetic/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rfg8jz", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/rfg8jz/is_there_a_way_to_skip_all_of_these_genetic/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1639403688, "score": 1, "selftext": "At the title states, I feel like I'm going crazy over here just trying to get tested.

She always makes appointments according to whenever me and my siblings are coming over so she can \"look nice for her grandkids\" which I think is absolutely adorable.

"selftext": "This is a long rant, please note before reading I love my parents both to death, but sometimes my dad does something small like this, and I get so mad, and I know it's only the diseases fault, but what's happening rn is just upsetting to me. Also, it's in a lot of detail, sorry if that annoys you, I just want to give you a story that's understandable with the needed background info. \n\nOkay so, my dad has Huntingtons, and the symptoms came pretty late, at age 54 or something. He still takes meds, but the symptoms are really showing when it comes to the way he acts/his personality. My mom also has an illness, sarcoidosis on her lungs. My dad tends to copy my mom, especially when she has a bad day/feels sick. The thing is, before he had his HD symptoms, he did kind of the same, and also felt sick/tired, and didn't really take care of my mom apart from making dinner and getting my mom to the doctor, but that's about it. He didn't realise that my mom was sometimes in the past so sick that she couldnt take care of herself, and needed some care from my dad. After getting mad at him, explaining the situation better, he would understand and apologise. Autism runs in my dads family aswell, and I am diagnosed with Autism and ADD, so I think it was purely due to the undiagnosed Autism, and him not understanding the assignment.\n\nMy mom had a succesfull surgery yesterday, and was allowed to go home after her sugery and last check-ups. Now is also a situation where she doesn't feel well, can't really take care of herself/ anyone/the dogs or do something in the house. As expected, sinnce my dad picked up my mom yesterdayevening, he has been acting like he also feels sore, and is really tired etc. \n\nYesterdaymorning I agreed with my dad to walking the dogs this morning at 7 am,  and my dad would walk the dogs yesterdayevening at around 10.30 pm. My dad and I (my mom had already gone to sleep) were watching tv yesterdayevening, and I noticed my dad falling asleep at 9 pm. I asked him: \"do you want me to walk the dogs this evening, that you do it tommorow morning?\" This was all not needed. I went to bed early, and couldnt sleep,  so I heard him walking up the stairs at around 11.30 pm, which is pretty late for him. Knowing my dad was tired, I thought he would go to bed early, but I also know that my dads logic is gone, so I shrugged it off and tried to go to sleep.\n\n\nWhen I came back from walking the dogs this morning, I heard something in the kitchen, and I was surprised to see that my mom was already up. She ate her breakfast, and went to rest on the couch, while I watched the dogs (we have a 6month old puppy, we have to have a constant eye on him, otherwise he'll do something bad/pee inside the house). At one point, I noticed it was 10.15 am, and my dad knows I have to leave to go to a friend today. I got pretty annoyed, because I know that he just stays in bed and doesn't do anything no matter the situation if he doesn't have a reason to get out of bed. I got especially annoyed because my mom told me that my dad was up when she woke up around 7.30am, and was just on his iPad. When I went to wake him up, he was \"asleep\" looked at me grumpy, and acted really sleepy, and talked with morning voice, that you can't really understand. The last two things are things he has never done before his HD symptoms, and are things that happen to my mom when my mom is really tired/has a bad day, which annoys me more, because he's copying my mom. \n\nThe only good thing about the situation is that he got downstairs around 10.30 am, normally it takes him way longer, so that I have the time to write this post and to get ready. \n\nThe thing what concerns me, is that my dad now doesn't apologise when someone comments on the way that he acts. He just gets frustrated, and sometimes gets even mad, especially at my mom, but lately, I notice its also easier for him to get mad at me, because apperently I look like my mom (sometimes he even calls me by my moms name). My mom has atleast 2 weeks of medical recovery, which can go upto 4, and I am not home for most of this day, this weekend I won't be home from fridayevening until sundayafternoon, and next week will be busy too. My mom needs to rest, and isn't allowed to pick things up, bend down, and needs to be careful with her body. Knowing the way my dad acts, and that I am busy, I'm scared that my dad won't be there for my mom when she needs it, and will get mad/annoyed at her when she askes for something/comments on something. He really feels like he can't do anything right when you do that, so you have to be carefull with the way you word things. Even when you give him a compliment, than he can take that as you being sarcastic/ talking to him like he's a toddler. \n\nThe things that need to be done aren't that big, like walking the dogs/giving my mom enough space to rest and sometimes give her food/making dinner/taking dishes out of the dishwasher, so my parents and I feel like we don't need help from other parties, especially because we already get so many help offered. My dad and I can do all of these things, but now we just need to do it more often. My older brother will be home this evening, and can help out a little, and my oldest brother will be home tommorow afternoon until sundayafternoon/evening, but he's mostly working. It does give me some peace atleast someone is there for this weekend (well, if he isn't working).\n\nDespite knowing this, the whole situation still doesn't sit well with me, because what happends if I move out in a few years? And just the way he's acting this morning, it feels like he's mocking my mom. I know he isn't, it's his disease, but it's just hard not to get mad at my dad. A part of me wants to stay home today and this weekend, but my parents said before the surgery that everything will be taken care off and that everything will be fine, and that I should have my own life. \n\nI'm really concerned about my moms health, I know she can take care of herself just fine, but I still worry. Seeing my dad act like this is very confronting, and makes me very mad and sad. I kind of predicted he would do something like this this morning, but I didn't think I would be so mad and mosly frustrated. I thought he understood that my mom needed some care. He also knew that I had an appointment this morning. The hardest thing is, that I can't really talk to him about it, because I know he wouldnt understand and would get mad at me, making the whole situation worse....\n\n\nHow do you deal with this?

His mother died from it, and his brother did too, just a couple years ago. When we were first dating, I asked hubby if he'd been tested for the gene, and he said that he'd rather not know, and that if he did find out he had it he would probably kill himself (please bear with me). I never agreed with that sentiment from him, but I know that it's not something I'll ever have to face, so I didn't judge.\n\nWe've been together for fourteen years, and married for a few years now. We've been trying to have a baby. I've had two miscarriages (which were very hard), but we're still trying.\n\nHowever. In recent months, I've started to notice what I think are Huntingtons symptoms in my husband. I'm not a doctor and by no means an expert on this, but I have noticed things. His personality has changed a little. He's become more clumsy. He now struggles to play the guitar (previously he was very good at this). He often has difficulty swallowing and chokes on his food. He gets little muscle tics in his face and hands. And the biggest change has come in his sleep. His sleep has become very disturbed, and he now makes a lot of noise in his sleep (like he's having the worst nightmare ever, every night). In his sleep, he sounds like his brother did when he was awake.\n\nI'm obviously worried about this, but (thanks to his earlier statements about suicide) I'm also worried about raising the issue with him. He still works full time, and I don't know if anyone else has noticed anything.\n\nComplicating all of this is that I know he wants to have a child, and I do too. I don't feel like I can talk to family or friends about this because (if my husband really does have Huntingtons, and I get pregnant anyway) I think I'll face a lot of judgment.

Grandfather died very old, with pretty advanced HD, but maintained mobility until the end...I'm gene positive with 40 repeats (as is my father, early 60s, and sister, early 30s).  I live in a small geographically isolated city, very far from family...we don't have a \\*bad\\* relationship...just not super close. We don't talk about our personal lives...we don't talk about HD...including among my very large and very at-risk extended famil...40+ people at risk and NO ONE TALKS ABOUT IT.  \n\nI had a few relationships when I was in my 20s and 30s and found out I was gene positive after my last one a few years ago.  I also contracted HIV a long time ago.  I  got my diagnosis mourning largely over with during that process, so I was kind of ::shrug:: about the HD result.  (not discount other's experiences). The one part that I haven't really worked through with HD is the dating/how to approach relationships going forward.  The life expectancy/pathology with HIV is pretty much the same as a \"normal\" person with the drugs available today.  With HD, that's obviously such a wild card and I haven't really processed the loss or change in what that might look like.  Then there is the whole caregiver thing, plus just subtle nuances that kind of color another person's perception.\n\nI go on dates from time-to-time, though being in a small area, the opportunity to do so with people I am attracted to is limited anyway. That said, I have met some really great people, but don't really know how to proceed.  Even those relationship prospects to whom I have disclosed my HD status and who have been supportive, I tend to push away. I just can't get comfortable \"condemning\" someone to this life....\n\nAnyone else in a similar position? Should i just stop wasting time and focus on the relationships i have in my life.  I don't want caregiving responsibilities for me to eventually fall on anyone else.

I figure when I get to a certain point of debilitation, when I can no longer do the things I love or derive enjoyment out of being alive due to HD, i'll figure out a way to move on...i mean this is the most practical sense possible...I am not depressed or \"suicidal.\"\n\nI do long for regular intimate companionship sometimes...that support you get from having a positive, familiar and trustworthy partner that you can confide in, experience physical intimacy with, and provide the same, in turn, but maybe I can pull those things from other parts of my life? Thos really strong intimate relationships take so much time and energy to build and maintain and I already feel myself less and less capable of adjusting my routine, compromising, etc (maybe as a product of becoming older and set in my ways), but also I am definitely experiencing some of the early stage etiology...memory and mood things.

She is a medical student and her dad is a doctor so they were asking me about any genetic disease in the family. I said well my auntie and uncle have some sort of auto immune disorder is the exact words i used. any they got really worried and from symptoms they mentioned the huntington word and asked if i would get tested. I had never considered it at all and so thought it is unlikely and agreed. For me it didnt fit the typical pattern as not present in grandparents or their siblings etc. The clinic i got tested at was in london and the geneticist agreed that a recessive ataxia was more likely than huntingtons, but they are very hard to test for and Huntington is much easier.\nLong story short i received my result and it was positive at 42 and now i have no clue what to do.\nI anticipate that the love of my life is going to leave me though.

I remember it hurt me more to find out my mom had the disease than me having the possibility. It\u2019s still hard to talk about even now. \n\nRegarding testing, I was never opposed, but also not particularly motivated. I did not want to get tested publicly as I worried about the possibility of discrimination. When there is an alternative, low probability is unnecessary risk in my mind. My family is late onset so I figured knowing at a young age didn\u2019t really matter. My mindset was that I would get tested if I ever got into a serious relationship.\n\nWhen I was 18 I joined the military and went off on my own, pretty much forgetting about HD for a decade. I had a few different mood disorders to learn how to understand and manage, so my mind was elsewhere. I did not have any serious relationships during this time, so getting tested wasn\u2019t a priority.\n\nIn my late 20\u2019s I decided it was best to know if I have HD so that I could adequately prepare for the future. There were a couple decisions to make which would change based on my diagnosis. I also came to understand that in a relationship, letting a person know my diagnosis long before it gets serious is better for everyone. So I set the money aside and found a place where I could be tested anonymously. \n\nI think it\u2019s worth mentioning my mindset going into testing. Early on in my life I decided to assume that I have HD, so that it would be easier to cope with if it turned out to be true. This helped me, I think by both lessening the initial blow and shortening the amount of time I needed to process. \n\nI got tested, and as I learned I had HD, I felt nothing. I thought this was because I had already come to terms with my situation. The following weeks on into months showed me otherwise. Waves of fear and sadness hit me, but mostly fear. A confusing amount of fear. I think this must be why some commit suicide after learning their diagnosis, to escape the fear. Fortunately I have experience with suicidal thoughts so I understood how to manage and not give weight to mine. \n\nSome of the worst of it was the visceral feelings I got from imagining, and trying to come to terms with, what HD will ultimately do to me physically and mentally. Having seen firsthand what it did to my grandfather on a week by week basis for years, I was paralyzed by fear of this death. I would wake up at night panicked and in a cold sweat. It reminded me of how I felt when my depression and anxiety were at their worst. The kind of angst that pushes past pain and into numbness, making you feel like you aren\u2019t real because your mind doesn\u2019t want to deal with it. I\u2019ve gotten used to this fear now so it doesn\u2019t bother me as much, but I don\u2019t expect it will ever really go away. This is simply the reality of the situation, fear of death is universal. \n\nBut there is strength and dignity. I don\u2019t believe in hope for a cure, this feels to me like an attempt to escape. If a cure comes I will be happy, but I certainly won\u2019t let my feelings be contingent on this. This is outside my control and would feel irresponsible for me to rely on. I would rather let go of my attachment to thinking I will get to live a full and normal life, or that I can avoid more suffering than what I initially expected from my life. I could die in a car accident tomorrow anyway. I plan to progress through my disease in a way I feel is dignified. \n\nThese are my feelings, I hope they don\u2019t come off as anything more. I respect your feelings and think they are valid, even if they\u2019re different than mine.\n\nNow to the point of my post, what\u2019s next? This question is meant for those with personal experience. What do I do next to best prepare for HD at my age? What did you do? What do you wish you did earlier? \n\nIf you made it all the way through this, thank you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1377, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What\u2019s Next for My Story?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/qdsvik/whats_next_for_my_story/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DevTheDummy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9htnhakr", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1634772140, "domain": "neuro-central.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/qcdtx8/thoughts/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qcdtx8", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/qcdtx8/thoughts/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "link", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "M9wLIC-mUG1eRk-cNsE-w8vr4wotuusLHhfLUzyZZ0w", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/keljNzxBEdm627B0WV66Tiu-57PiqRl6Jff9XK6b85A.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcac99c465fe14bcdd57ba3805e7c49b11c53df0", "width": 108}], "source": {"height": 150, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/keljNzxBEdm627B0WV66Tiu-57PiqRl6Jff9XK6b85A.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=26ae9678906be9f78181802782f804ccbd01afc2", "width": 150}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1634772152, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1375, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Thoughts?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.neuro-central.com/prilenia-and-huntington-study-group-announce-completion-of-patient-enrollment-ahead-of-schedule-in-global-phase-3-proof-hd-huntingtons-disease-clinical-trial/", "url_overridden_by_dest": "https://www.neuro-central.com/prilenia-and-huntington-study-group-announce-completion-of-patient-enrollment-ahead-of-schedule-in-global-phase-3-proof-hd-huntingtons-disease-clinical-trial/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "celestria_star", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_anyfbato", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1634764897, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/qcbb6v/im_37_i_dont_know_if_i_have_hd/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qcbb6v", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/qcbb6v/im_37_i_dont_know_if_i_have_hd/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1634764908, "score": 1, "selftext": "My dad passed away from HD 13 years ago.

She's pretty much my platonic life partner and she and her daughter mean everything to me. I plan on being her caregiver when things progress because she doesn't have much family, and the family that does also has Huntington's. I understand the disease and just need guidance from other people who also have this disease.\n\n-How can you appoint someone as a caregiver and what was the timeline for getting a POA? How far into the disease is someone capable of doing so? I feel it should be done as soon as possible but I don't want her to feel as though she's losing her freedoms.\n\n-I am mot married. Currently I have had to use my vacation time to care for her, is there any way to legally be able to assist her with medical insurance/assistance with her child/pto things like that without becoming her spouse? Personally not opposed because I feel it would make things easier. I just don't think that's necessarily... legal?\n\n-Progression of Huntington's from knowing her mom was gradual. Her mom recently died, she was 50. Lately my friend has been having episodes of tremors that are intense or require an emergency room visit. They last from 2-6 hours and have peaks where they are worse and then subside. Is this Huntington's or possibly something else? Everything I've seen I haven't heard of someone having episodes like this. \n\nWith this post I'm really just trying to find guidance in the best ways to support my friend. I'm her real only support that can help her the best financially and emotionally, and later when that time comes I will be her daughters guardian. I just don't know if there are any other legal steps I can take to assist her better. I have great insurance and she currently has no way to see a neurologist or better psychiatrist. My employer is thankfully understanding, but I can't give the reason I'm missing work is because of my best friends health concerns for very long. I feel they or any other employer I may go to won't see that as serious because she isn't a spouse or blood relative. \n\nI appreciate any advice, this disease is bullshit for anyone it affects and my heart goes out to all of you.

I have been asking questions on r/Huntingtons for the past month and I appreciate all the comments. The prompt for this essay was: \"Adolescents should be encouraged to defer predictive or predispositional\ntesting for adult-onset conditions until adulthood\nbecause of the complexity of the potential impact of the\ninformation at formative life stages.\" I would love any and all comments/suggestions :)\n\nPredictive Testing for Huntington's in Teenagers\n \nImagine being unable to control your body, swallow your food, or speak to your loved ones. This is the physical and emotional suffering that Huntington\u2019s patients endure late in life. Huntington's Disease (HD) is a hereditary, cerebral disorder which causes integral components of the brain to die (HDSA, 2015). Genetic testing can provide an early. As a result of the adverse effects on the mind and lifestyle, there is an ongoing debate regarding the ethical issues surrounding predictive testing for teenagers. Although it is essential to have information about one\u2019s health, teenagers should be urged to delay predictive testing for Huntington's until adulthood because of the intricacy of the information and its effect on formative life decisions. Making choices about having children, especially during teen pregnancy, and, most importantly the effects of preselection, are all the items worth considering.\n \nHuntington's is a hereditary disease caused by a mutation in the HTT gene (IT15 Gene) located on chromosome 4 (Sathasivam, 2013). The normal copy of the gene manufactures the huntingtin protein; the mutated gene is larger than it should be, because of a large number of CAG repeats. Not much is known about how the interactions between the protein and the brain lead to the death of many important sections of the brain (HDSA, 2015). As brain cells die, the patient becomes increasingly unable to control their movements, emotions, and thoughts. Although there are variations in the symptoms, almost all HD patients pass away because of complications resulting from the inability to control motor functions, the problems include choking and falling.\n \nAlthough there is no cure, there is a simple blood test that can be used to screen for the disease (Genetics Home Reference, 2013). There are three outcomes of the test: negative, positive and uncertain. A negative result means that the individual will not develop HD and that both genes contain normal CAG repeats. A positive result means that the individual is at high risk for HD (Nordqvist, 2015). It reveals that they have 40+ CAG repeats. The result does not, however, forecast the time of onset or type on symptoms. The last result is uncertain; some people with a CAG repeats (36-39) never develop symptoms, while others develop drastic ones (Nordqvist, 2015). Genetic testing can sometimes be a particularly useful tool to avoid passing on the gene onto future generation.\n \nMany adolescents wonder about what it feels like to have kids and get married. They dream about the experiences they will have and the joy that a child\u2019s laughter will bring into their lives. Through these dreams, they begin to formulate ideas of having long and prosperous lives. A positive result would start to seem like an impossibility. For many teenage parents, a positive result for HD would cause even more complications within their lives. The added stress could result in severe psychological trauma that adversely affects daily life. Consequently, this may take many years to overcome and result in other psychological disorders such as depression, insomnia, and anxiety (Alary, 2012).\n \nHuntington\u2019s doesn\u2019t just affect the decision of having kids and impact teen parents; it also causes preselection. Preselection, in this case, refers to a phenomenon where the family unconsciously classifies their children as carriers or non-carriers (Smolina, 2007). An example of preselection is the gender segregation in India, boys are encouraged to start businesses, and pursue higher education. Whereas, girls are expected to be housewives, bear children, and discouraged from pursuing a higher education. Similarly, if the family members think that child A is unaffected by HD, child A will be urged to seek post-secondary education, have children, and look for a promising job, whereas child B (who is seen as a carrier) will be given different advice and there will be significantly lower expectations for him or her. There may also be an unequal distribution of financial support, love, and nurturing.\n \nUltimately, adolescents should be encouraged to postpone predictive testing for Huntington\u2019s until they are over 18 because of the complexity of the information and its impact on formative life decisions. Decisions such as marriage, reproduction (especially in the teenage years), and to a different extent, the effects of preselection all need to be carefully considered. Huntington\u2019s is an awful disease, and can devastate a child if they learn that they have it before they reach the right age.\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAlary, B. (2012, June 18).

"score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone. My uncle told me in 2012 that my father has Huntington\u2019s disease after he was admitted to a facility to take care of him. He said my grandmother had it as well. \n\nFor a long time it was tough for me to cope with that. Not only could I be at risk for having it but it suddenly gave an explanation to the horror I\u2019d suffered through as a child. My father regularly beat my mother and self medicated with alcohol and drugs. He kicked us out of our home when I was ten years old. My mom, my autistic brother and I lived with friends and with relatives in their living rooms and basements for years until I got accepted into college and moved away. \n\nI had thought the horror was finally over and I was recovering emotionally from the pain my father had caused me and my family. I was angry. I had lots of issues developing relationships with others. I wanted nothing to do with my father and I had not spoken to him or seen him in years. My dad\u2019s brother called me in my senior year of college to tell me that my dad was at the va hospital. The fire department had him admitted after they condemned the house I had grown up in. He had torn it to pieces, written insane things on the walls about my mom. He wasn\u2019t paying the utility bills and was living in the home without water or electricity. The fire department found him trying to tap into a fire hydrant to get water. The house of horrors was repossessed and my father went to the care facility he is living in today. \n\nI went to visit him in 2013 and his condition frightened me. The man I had always feared was now small and fragile. He looked horrible. He said mean things to me and I left, not returning again until just now after Thanksgiving of this year. \n\nI\u2019m 28 now and I feel that I\u2019m better equipped to handle having something of a relationship with my father before he dies. I can\u2019t exactly forgive him for what he has done despite knowing he has an explanation. But I am at peace with what happened now. I am married happily and I have a job that I love and am very good at. My wanting to reach out to him now was to scratch the itch of knowing what this disease is doing to him and how it could possibly affect me some day. \n\nThese days his involuntary movements are much more pronounced. He can\u2019t walk very well and he can hardly hold a cup of water, put clothes on, or feed himself. He is able to speak and we have conversations on a shallow lighthearted level. When he called me and told me he loved me over the phone, it nearly killed me inside. I feel tremendous amounts of guilt at times for taking so long to see him since 2013. The feelings are complex and difficult to put into words. These days I\u2019m just crying almost at random all of the time. \n\nDespite everything that happened and all of the emotional pain of bringing an abuser back into my life, the biggest challenge for me is facing the reality that I now have a 50% chance that this could happen to me. And making the decision to get tested is a tremendously painful one. I think seeing his condition in 2013 shocked me enough to not want to return. I\u2019ve been living blissfully ignorant throughout the rest of my twenties. Here I am getting closer to 30 and now I need to know if this condition could affect my life in the near future. My father started the personality changes when I was very little, in his mid thirties. I could show symptoms soon. \n\nThank you for reading my story. I just needed to put my feelings into words. I am seeing my primary care doctor on Wednesday for a referral to the local genetic testing facility.

Sorry if this is against the rules of this subreddit.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Read before\n2. My perspective\n3. Grandparents\n4. Parents\n5. Brother\n6. Final thoughts\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Hello readers, let me preface this with a couple of disclosures. This writing may contain vulgar language, difficult to discuss topics, and Huntington\u2019s disease-specific jargon. This is a very informal piece of writing, as I am just trying to get a few things off of my chest. I feel as if there is a great need inside of me to write my own thoughts down. I said to myself a year ago around this time that I would do this but I have put it off ever since. I am hoping that writing this would alleviate some of the dark and deep thoughts that keep me up at night from their sporadic conjuring. This very informal piece of writing is about my thoughts and feelings about Huntington\u2019s disease and how it has impacted my family. I hope it can be used as a guide to help others understand what is going on in the mind of someone who is significantly impacted by Huntington\u2019s disease and/or for others who are also impacted by the disease to reflect and share ideas with one another. This writing will be quite long so I would like to provide an outline above to make it as less confusing as possible to navigate through with perfect clarity. A little info about me to help you understand my situation; I am 19 years old, I live with my parents and my brother, and my brother, father, and I are both HD positive as well.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHuntington\u2019s disease, those two words alone make me so uncomfortable. It is as if I would rather hear the noise of other rather foul things than the two words that title a mere disease; except it is not just a mere disease to me, it is the dictator of my very existence. Everything I do, I do by thinking about Huntington\u2019s disease, and how it impacts my decision to choose something or the latter. Sometimes my decision making is skewed by the ever-changing perspective I have on the disease. I do not currently know how many repeats that are contained my DNA, though I am in the process of obtaining that information. I try to make important life choices with the thought in mind that I would be a \u201cmess\u201d in my mid-thirties and die in my mid-forties, forbidding any unforeseeable circumstances. It forces me to think with the mentality of either saying, \u201cFuck it\u201d or \u201cHow will this impact me later on?\u201d. I keep to myself for the most part, I do not have many friends for the fact that it is hard to be open and personal with others when engaged in a relationship. I think about finding love in the future all the time, I would love to get married and have kids but that is just something someone of my \u201cstatus\u201d can only dream about. I have educated myself a great deal on the disease of which I consider to be a huge factor of my existence. I have written many papers and made my graduation project based on the topic of the disease. I have talked with the wonderful doctors and nurses that work at the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, where I participated in a study to store a vile of my blood in a bank for experimentation. I struggle with having faith and hope due to the circumstances of my situation. I do not enjoy hearing that the lord is just testing me, I find it hard to believe sometimes even though I would love to. I am content with a cure not coming out in my lifetime, and I am perfectly okay with dying. I have always thought about death from HD as some sort of defeat, which is why I sometimes wish death upon my self in other forms so I would not be defeated by the disease that has tainted my family tree. I would never kill myself for the sake of my mother, she has already been through so much, and even then I do not believe that I would have the willpower to do so. I try to look at life as a gift because even though I will not grow old, there are many others in worse situations who die young. So I try to appreciate all that I have been given in life. I struggled with thoughts that I had juvenile HD for a while. I would be in the middle of a test and my leg muscles would twitch uncontrollably for a few seconds, and I would ask my self why am I wasting my time worrying about a silly test when I am about to die soon. Those same twitches used to keep me up a night all the time, but the doctor at Wake Forest insisted that is was some sort of benign fasciculation. I still have doubts about it but learning that was like learning I was a free man, for the time being. I would also like to mention that I am truly grateful for those before me and the sacrifices they made to make sure that I would be in the best possible situation for whatever happens to me later in life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love all of my grandparents, from both sides of the family, but I just feel a stronger connection to those of my Father\u2019s side. A connection that is derived from a genetic disease. The story goes that my grandfather went to the doctor expressing minor symptoms so they sent him out to get tested. He found out that he tested positive for HD, so my father immediately got tested and got a positive test too. However, my father\u2019s test results unveiled something so unbelievable that the staff had to do a double take. The test showed that my father inherited two copies of the gene, one from each parent. Nobody could believe it, as my grandmother was in denial it helped her put together the pieces of the puzzle that were her mother. I had not known this information until recently after my grandmother\u2019s funeral. My mother did not tell this to me or my brother because with that sort of information, it would allow one to figure that there would be a one hundred percent chance of inhering the disease. After learning of that information it allowed me to in a way, connect the dots to everything. I am rather tall so when I went to get a drink from the fridge at my grandparents\u2019 house one day, I saw a \u201cDo Not Resuscitate\u201d document for my grandfather signed off by the doctor at Wake Forest. I initially questioned why anyone would have that sort of documentation, but after some consideration and having similar thoughts, I came to an understanding of their decision. The bizarre part about this was that years later I saw the same document on top of the fridge but it was for my grandmother, and it was signed off by the same doctor at Wake Forest. I was so confused at the time, and it irritates me now that I could not have understood what it meant. My grandfather was a carpenter, a jack of all trades and truly a master at all of them. I looked up to him a great deal when I was young, and I was concerned when I heard that he was being fired from multiple job sites and retiring early. It then made a lot of sense given his diagnosis, and he quickly became visually symptomatic. I am grateful for spending a lot of time with him, especially in his later years. He gave up smoking and drinking so he could prolong his life a little longer, which is like climbing Mount Everest for someone with HD. A side note from that; the doctor at Wake Forest mentioned to me that it is very unlikely for people with HD to get cancer (except skin cancer), which helped me understand why my grandfather and my great uncle never developed any form of lung cancer, but my grandmother had melanoma at one point in her life. My grandfather\u2019s rapid deterioration has helped me in a way visualize how my death will ensue. I sometimes am regretful for not spending much time with my grandmother in her later years, though I am grateful for spending a significant amount of time with her and my grandfather when I was younger. I never even suspected her of having HD, she was not visually symptomatic in the slightest. My mother likes to use her as an example as the perfect scenario for someone with HD, as she had the highest number of CAG repeats out of my dad and grandfather, and she was a successful bank manager who lived into her sixties with little to no symptoms. I did not attend my grandmother\u2019s funeral because my mother wanted to in a way shelter my brother and I from the information that would be told during the service, and I am grateful for that because at the time I do not think I was ready for that. During the later days of her life, apparently, she went through a period of enlightenment and wrote down her thoughts on sticky notes and placed them all around her house. I say apparently because I was not there as my mother wanted to shield the idea that my grandmother had the disease from my brother and me, again of which that I am grateful for because I do not think I was ready for at the time. I just wish I could read what some of her final thoughts were, but nevertheless, I love and respect my grandmother more so after my realization. I always thought that my grandmother died from starvation because she did not want to live anymore without her husband; though that was somewhat true, I never had a clue to what the real cause of her death was. We spread their ashes on a tree that overlooks their house, the house that my grandfather built himself. I wish we had the money to keep the house but unfortunately, we had to sell it, but at least their ashes lay with one another. Their deaths were extremely hard on my father, and I am truly grateful that he has my mother at his side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are probably the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. I love each one to the point where it is genuinely difficult to find the words that can describe how much they mean to me. My father is someone who I have looked up to my life. He is extremely smart and knowledgeable about a lot of things regarding dad-like topics, just like his father. It is extremely saddening to me to see him deteriorate the way that he is. My father used to scare me senseless when he got mad back when I was younger. His face would turn red hot as he screamed and slammed his hands on whatever he could find, it was as if I was looking the devil himself in the face at times. As I began to gain a better understanding of the symptoms of HD it has given me an explanation to his uncanny behaviors. My father has gotten to the point where he falls, spills drinks, and makes a mess with whatever he does; so we rarely if ever eat out anymore. In a way I am pleased with the way that is so, it allows for our family to eat together with no distractions or pressures from the outside world. It is extremely embarrassing to notice the stares and whispers while out with my father, I have grown to accept it but even then it is still challenging. I have a lot of fond memories with my father but I get frustrated when the embarrassing ones crowd my mind and overshadow the fond memories I would like to remember. I find is absolutely saddening to see how my father treats my mother sometimes. The things he says and does are at times so unspeakable, I really want to blame the disease for his actions. It makes me wonder if that same type of behavior will be the same that I will exhibit later in my life. It is like the flipping of a switch sometimes, one moment he is the most lovable guy that I am proud to call my dad and another moment where I am looking into his eyes and asking myself who or what is controlling his mind. My father attempts to help around the house when clearly stated not to, at times his thoughtfulness is admirable but often times is stressful as it ends up being more work than originally required. It makes me tear up every time I think about how he participates in studies down at Wake Forest just so one day there could be a cure for my brother and I, the nurses there told me that he is not doing it for himself but in fact that he is doing it for me. I know it is pretty clich\u00e9 to say that my father is someone who I consider to be a hero but the sacrifices he has made help me consider him as such. My mother, on the other hand, is the strongest woman I know. She has given up everything in her life for my brother and I. I know she could have easily left my dad a long time ago, but she decided to stay for whatever reason and I am truly grateful for that. Taking care of my father has become a full-time job as of recently, so she sacrificed her career to take off work to help him and care for herself. I say take care of herself because the amount of stress that she has endured from my father over the years has taken a great toll on her health. I love my mom to the moon and back for the sacrifices she has made for me and everyone else in the family, and I cannot put into words how much she means to me. She is an example of why I do not plan on marrying and having kids in the future. I feel like she is trapped in a life that she does not deserve, and I would not want to wish that on anybody or make anyone feel that way. My mother has proven time and time again her strength and wisdom through her perseverance in the life she was given. My mother is a nurse and I am grateful to have someone in the house that is knowledgeable on medicine and medical practices. In the past months, my parents have been attending church on a regular basis and I am delighted to see that the two of them are doing much better than they previously were. My father drives everyone crazy sometimes and I know he does not mean to and sometimes it is at the fault of the disease. Which leads to my greatest fear of all, I am afraid that after my father passes away that I will feel relieved in a sense that we do not have to worry about taking care of him anymore. I do not enjoy entertaining these thoughts because it feels wrong to me yet they still crowd my mind sometimes. I love both of my parents with all of my heart and appreciate everything that they have done for my brother and I. As far as my brother goes, he is an entirely different story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love my brother but he sure makes it extremely difficult at times to do so. I know it is hard for both of us to realize it now, but in the future, we are going to be all that we have. Sadly, I do not think he is anywhere close to coming to that realization. One of the nurses at Wake Forest made an excellent point to not have much baggage when you get to your years of deterioration, and to try to travel light. What she meant by that is to try to be physically fit and active to prolong deterioration and to make the whole process easier by being prepared for the fight, giving those a better chance of living better and longer until the very end. My brother is what one would call obese, and I am very proud of him for making great strides to become healthy. My only real gripe with my brother is that I feel that he does not appreciate our parents enough to spend any time with them. Our dad is dying and he could not care enough to spend any time with him. The excuse of being uncomfortable around him and seeing how he is deteriorating is getting really old with me. The only time he gets to spend genuine time with my dad is at the dinner table, even then, he arrives late and leaves early most of the time. It is also very frustrating to see him talk to our mother the way that he does, after all of the sacrifices that she has made for this family. I do not know what it is going to take to get him to change, something like a drastic occurrence I suppose. I used to wish that I was the only one of us to inherit the disease, to in a way make up for how I treated him in our younger years. Now that we both have inherited the disease, I do not know what to think. I am just now coming to a realization that I have never put much thought in the idea of him actually having the disease as well. I am fine with myself dying from the disease if I must, but the thought of my brother having to go through the whole ordeal frightens me. We butt heads and argue often, but I just want the best for him in life. When our parents both pass away I hope by then we are more than capable of guiding ourselves to a path that best suits our needs and continue to stick side by side with one another.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo end this informal piece of therapeutic writing I would like to give thanks, to those who read this extensive little spiel, and the members of my family who have expressed everlasting love through significant sacrifices. I am very appreciative of the life I have been given with the hand that I have been dealt. I plan on participating in as many studies and trials in hopes to help find a cure for the young kids with their whole life ahead of them who do not realize that one day they are going to receive some information that is going to feel like a gunshot to the stomach to learn. I feel that everyone should be appreciative of what they have been given even if it is not much. Huntington\u2019s disease has stressed me out for years, and it has kept me up at night almost every day with dark thoughts. I wanted to use this piece of writing to help me calm some of the thoughts that keep me up at night and to connect with others and share different or similar experiences. If you need someone to talk to who has some sort of experience in this depressing field, feel free to message me anytime. I came up with a slogan for my family that says, \u201cAgainst all odds\u201d, and I believe the inheritance of Huntington\u2019s disease is something that forces many individuals to show true strength and courage to attempt to defy the odds and be more than a mere statistic.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 529, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Against All Odds", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/a12vff/against_all_odds/"}, {"author": "AthJN", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2lo87bzh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542668450, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/9ym12w/questions_about_testing/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9ym12w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/9ym12w/questions_about_testing/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1542668451, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve just found out that my bio dads father and also his brother passed from HD.

They have created a survey for caregivers who have a loved one wth Juvenile HD and are asking for your help by answering these questions. \n\nThey are hoping to learn some basic information in order to help create a worldwide registry for the JHD community. HDYO plans to use the information from this survey and the future registry to work collaboratively with healthcare professionals, pharmaceutic companies, and policy makers in hopes of offering better care, more support, and enhanced research efforts for those with JHD.  If you are a caregiver of someone with JHD or you know someone please consider supporting this short survey.  It will be available through end of 2018 and the registry will be available sometime Spring 2019.   If you have any questions, I am happy to answer.

Mom was diagnosed with HD over 10 years ago, but the past year- year and half have been the worst. \n\nMom fell in July walking to the pool, was admitted for elevated WB count, and then we found out she had aspiration pneumonia. They sent her home with meds and at this time it was kind of just decided by family that I be her sole caregiver (12 weeks pregnant at this time mind you). \n\nWhen mom first got home it was great. She was compliant. She knew she needed my help. She received ST, OT, and PT for a little over a month but was  discharged because she had plateaued.  A couple weeks later my husband and I took a trip up north for 4 days (we payed her caregiver extra to take care of her during the weekend).

She doesn\u2019t raise her voice to anyone else, just me.\n\nI\u2019ve tried talking to her about how much easier it would be if she agreed to do assisted living- especially with me being pregnant and expecting my first child (I\u2019m an only child btw).

It\u2019s obvious to many people who\u2019ve watched this disease attack our family, but of course, not to her. She won\u2019t even consider it. She has moments and whole days where she\u2019s fairly competent, and times when she\u2019s combative, uncoordinated, and can\u2019t express a complete thought. She has obsessive thoughts. She has difficulty swallowing many foods and has tailored her diet to avoid them, citing GERD. She still drives. I haven\u2019t allowed my son to ride with her for ten years and invented my own car sickness to make sure I am always the one driving when she\u2019s with me, but no one in my family, including my dad when he was alive, would support my push to get her to stop driving. \n\nI live across the country. Living with me isn\u2019t an option. She also hates where I live (big city versus her rural town), she wouldn\u2019t be safe or comfortable there, and I can\u2019t imagine moving her away from her familiar surroundings and few remaining friends. I have a brother who lives near her, but who is also convinced she\u2019s still fine to live alone and is more a drain on her meager financial resources than anything. I finally convinced her to see a doctor for a physical next month, and I hope so much that she sends up a million red flags. Doubtful that she\u2019ll mention the HD risk. \n\nDoes anyone know what my options are here? I\u2019d like to at the very least get someone to check in on her several times a week to make sure she\u2019s taking care of herself. I\u2019ve considered a medical alert system that she can wear to call for help if she falls. Can I legally call her doctor and mention HD? Should I? I\u2019m anticipating that  she\u2019ll probably require full time care within a year if she progresses the way her siblings did.  I\u2019d like her to be able to grieve my dad before we rip her from her home, but in the meantime...?

My dad was diagnosed with HD about a month ago, leading up to this none of my family even knew what this disease was. My dad was adopted when he was 2 weeks old, his birth mother did not provide any family medical history so we had no idea that we were at risk. Usually people see the disease throughout their family growing up and have fair warning that it might be something they have to cope with in the future. Thats obviously not the case for my family. \n\nMy parents have two kids. First there is me, i'm 20 and then there is my younger brother who is 17. My brother is autistic and doesn't fully understand what is going on with my dad. It is extremely hard to try and explain why my dad, his favourite person in the world, is acting differently. I will be devastated if my bother carries the gene, he has gone through so much already in the last 17 years. I'm praying that if either one of us has the gene it is me.\n\nThe hardest part of all of this is that my parents are blaming themselves for putting my brother and i through this. My dad keeps apologizing to me because he thinks its his fault. \n\nIt's so hard, i literally don't know how to cope. All of the people close to me keep telling me that everything is going to get better, but i know its not, i'm just going to get used to it. Every time i mention something about having the gene all i get back from them is \"you don't have it, stop\" i don't know if this is them trying to be positive but its making it worse!! I want them to help me accept that there is a 50&amp;#37; chance is do.  i know it's not their job but i just want the support. \n\nI have gone to support groups but it's too much. I just get anxious and sad listening to other peoples stories. \n\nI'm just venting at this point. I had so much i wanted to say but now i'm all worked up and my thoughts aren't clear.

If there are more than two or three tasks to do, I become disabled by the very thought of them and don't start anything.\n\nI have tics. I have been on Prozac for seven years since the age of 13 and over the past 3 years, have developed tics that have worsened from head twitching to full on arm jerking and shuddering.

I\u2019m doing okay with knowing it could be a possibility and I\u2019ll know in a few months.\n\nMy dad has something neurologically wrong with him and is on disability but hasn\u2019t gotten a diagnosis. He\u2019s in his early 60s but symptoms started at least ten years ago. His personality has changed, and he has other symptoms. We don\u2019t have a family history of HD so he wasn\u2019t tested for it. His father is the one who would have had the gene and he died of a stroke in his early 70s. He might have had very minor symptoms prior to that but nothing big. My grandfather\u2019s sister died of \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s\u201d but that definitely could have been a misdiagnosis. His parents died of heart disease.\n\nSo why am I worried? I have HD symptoms at 34 (started like 8 years ago very mild) and have been tested for everything under the sun. \n\nFinally my new neurologist referred me to a movement disorder specialist in April.

HD.\n\nMy cousin on my dad\u2019s side has similar symptoms. \n\nSo I\u2019m going to get tested in April probably.

I also hope for a cure for those who are also impacted by this disease such as a person's surrounding family.

When I was first told that my father had some disease in his brain as a young child I thought he was going to die very soon. When his death is drawn out over many years through different stages of debilitation it has made me think about the whole situation differently. The week leading up to his death I thought he would die each day so after a couple of days my tear supply dried up after a while, and I was able to be more content/calm about the whole situation. Though I was not prepared for the moments right before his death. He continued to worsen and it started to sound like he was struggling to breathe. I held his hand for hours and hours every day hoping that he would die while holding my hand like what he did for his dad, and I am so relieved that I was able to do so. Every day that I got to spend with him whether it be a bad day or good day I am glad that I went out of my way to spend time with him in some way shape or form. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad is the most wholesome person I know, often told he has such a big heart. The ironic part about it is that during the week where he was declining at a rapid pace, all of his organs gave way but not his heart. Up until his final minutes, his heart was pumping fast and hard. After that, I will always think of my dad as a big-hearted individual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot being old enough to know what I do not know is what gets to me thinking about my childhood. When I started getting to the age where I needed advice, wisdom, and guidance is when my grandfather and my dad started to rapidly decline. At the same time, I have to hand it to my mother who has kept my family grounded and has taken care of my father better than anyone else.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring this time I have realized how thankful for all of the people that have loved and cared for my family. So for this new year, I plan on taking the time to thoroughly thank everyone who I now have a great appreciation for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cannot say for sure that if my family would be as close if we had not been affected by Huntington's disease, but I know for certain that I would give everything up to see my dad as a healthy normal person for once.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vjrnqyh19b941.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=029aae378b46d9104a4c7e9d0ede91ae49b01e3c", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 843, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "For Once", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/el8e9q/for_once/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "St_Mo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2htysui8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578359793, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/el3tbo/living_at_risk/", "gildings": {}, "id": "el3tbo", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/el3tbo/living_at_risk/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578359799, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThe first thing is first, I am happy I found this group. I have never talked to anyone else who lives with this disease directly or through a loved one.\n\nSome background, I am a 29-year-old male. My mom had Huntington disease and passed away when I was 14, she was 39. My older brother and sister both tested in 2010, my brother, fortunately, tested negative, however, my sister was not lucky. \n\nI never got to know my mom personally as she was always sick for as long as I can remember. Me and my sister grew up close. My sister first started showing signs around the time she was in high school (I'd say 17 was when it was getting obvious she had without the need for a test).\n\nFast forward to today, she is 33 years old and is in the very late stages of the disease. She is 100% dependant on my grandma. The disease progressed extremely quick with her. The past few months, she just screams and cries in bed all day and violently flails around and is super thin although she does eat. It is truly heartbreaking. My family are trying to care for her as much as possible and aren't open to keeping her in a nursing home until we truly have no choice. \n\nFor most of my life, I have been at peace at the possibility of getting this disease. I elected to not test because I know I wouldn't be able to handle a positive result.  My outlook on life is positive, aside from my sister's condition, I am a happy guy.  I always told myself that \"I could waste my life feeling sorry for myself, go get tested, find out I am negative and get hit by a bus on the way home.\" which to me means to enjoy the life you have because you never know. \n\nI recently got engaged (I fully disclosed the nature of this disease and the odds I may get it to her). Now that I am engaged and my sister's condition is worsening, I have been thinking a lot about the possibility that I may inherit the gene more and more. I have become too self-aware with my behaviour and anything that matches one of the symptoms of the disease, I attribute it to Huntington and not a normal human response to something. For example, if I feel depressed, it is not because of my sister's status but because I have the disease. If I forget something, it is because of the disease and not just because I forget it.  It can be exhausting and obsessive at times which is ironic since I read symptom of a disease is obsessive thinking or being stuck on the same thought.\n\nI am not sure what the point of this post was, it was a bit of a ramble. I never had anyone to talk to that I could relate to. Me and my sister never discussed this together and now it is too late. So I just needed people to relate to and dump this on.\n\nI am ok with not getting tested, but I feel that is not fair to my fiancee (She is supportive) and I feel like I am going to live my life always being anxious about whether I will be HD+ or not and become too self-aware and over-analyze myself.  But should I for the sake of my fiancee? I feel like she needs to be able to prepare for it and we'd need to explore IVF if we elect to have kids. But I am too fearful of how I will become if I test positive. \n\nThank you to those who chose to read through that diary entry and provide some insight.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 841, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Living at risk", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/el3tbo/living_at_risk/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LynJoseph", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_58ll09an", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578346002, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/el0mdw/pgdivf_and_hd/", "gildings": {}, "id": "el0mdw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/el0mdw/pgdivf_and_hd/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578346009, "score": 1, "selftext": "This is my first time looking into any online support for HD, so bare with me and be gentle! \n\nMy partner's mother has HD. Her symptoms started in her 40s and she has been in a long term care facility for around 10 years. \n\nMy partner does not want to know his status and I 100% support that. We are both \"glass is half empty\" kind of people and have discussed that knowing his status will not make his life any better since he currently lives life to the fullest as if he is negative. This decision doesn't sit well in particular with my support system ( which is what brought me here!) but they are very respectful as I have explained to them it is very easy to say that someone SHOULD do something, such as get tested,  especially when that person is not you or your loved one.\n\nWe were looking to start a family next year but I am feeling a little lost after a recent consult with our Reproductive Endocrinologist. We were looking into IVF and preimplantation genetic testing which would result in only HD-free embryos to be implanted. Apparently this isn't able to be done without knowing his status. Yes, they could technically not share our genetic results with us, but if by chance all of the embryos were positive for HD, they would have to tell us that there are no embryos to implant, giving away his status (we should have no issue conceiving because we are both healthy)\n\n   \nMy insurance would possibly cover some this treatment with only his mother's confirmed diagnosis but like I said, apparently it becomes obvious if the embryos test positive. \n\nTo be honest, I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place with no answers that will make both me and my partner happy. My partner absolutely does not want to know his status. To be frank, I feel like my options are to:\n\n1. Get pregnant naturally, test the fetus without my partner's knowledge, and decide whether or not to continue the pregnancy. This nonoption is dishonest and lonely. \n2. Get pregnant naturally, do not test the fetus, and spend my life obsessing over my child's potential status. This option seems like a recipe of me harboring resentment towards my partner. \n3. Get a sperm donor. This option will allow me to carry my own child which is something I look forward to but then I wonder how that will affect my partner in the long run. Will he ever look at them one day and not feel as much of a connection as I do? \n4. Adopt. This costs a lot of money in my area and I will not get to carry my own child. Not the end of the world but still something I would be missing out on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm basically looking for ANY advice. Are there ways to successfully complete PGD/IVF without obviously confirming status? Am I putting way to much thought into this? I'd also love to hear from any HD+ folks who decided to have children naturally and what helped them come to this decision. \n\nI absolutely love my partner to death and I am with him through thick and thin, but with that being said,I want to protect my future children from anything I can, if it is in my means to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for any input, \n\nLJ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 840, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "PGD/IVF and HD", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/el0mdw/pgdivf_and_hd/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "island_tree_storm", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4zcz5b7l", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578160402, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "edited": 1578178424, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/ejzu2m/nac_nacetylcysteine_for_delaying_onset_of_hd/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejzu2m", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/ejzu2m/nac_nacetylcysteine_for_delaying_onset_of_hd/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "RYLuRcspBX2Eank36PakIVsRvH29_3wETTGjMUvDNKw", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TzcEMUVuUvsweYPGs8K88RLA6eNVf60GDf-ImyyB46k.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8884fa1a46e577191a2f8177cc24f50b0b40d21d", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TzcEMUVuUvsweYPGs8K88RLA6eNVf60GDf-ImyyB46k.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca15158880d41f0c4154175f19ffff0e31a83988", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TzcEMUVuUvsweYPGs8K88RLA6eNVf60GDf-ImyyB46k.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fcc0cb300ce2068b6e9f7c192cc6ed2cc6e2d1b", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TzcEMUVuUvsweYPGs8K88RLA6eNVf60GDf-ImyyB46k.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5bb2a3e98bf285adc26b31d4e2a87ab4cd6a6b2b", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1578196586, "score": 5, "selftext": "Hello I was given the news my Father has Huntington's on January 1st (Happy New Years!).

My grandfather had it and died when I was very very young and his illness and the nature of it were kept from me my whole life. When I found out the truth earlier this year from my siblings, naturally I asked if my mom had the gene.

But that fear wasn\u2019t eliminated, only transferred onto my sisters and I. She has seemed to be in poor health the past few years with a variety of medical issues, the most significant being her declining mood and emotional state. I am in constant worry, wondering when or if the day will come. \n\nMy three sisters and I are all either in or approaching the point in our lives where we want to have children, but we\u2019re all hesitant to start because we worry that we\u2019ll be passing on the gene. But at the same time we\u2019re all still too scared to get tested ourselves because if one of us is positive, we wouldn\u2019t be able to keep it from our mom and that would cause a *major* rift in our family. \n\nI really wish she would just get tested and give her children some peace of mind or time to prepare, but it\u2019s a selfish desire and one that I have to let go of.

I\u2019m late 40\u2019s and not symptomatic (I think!) although I have a minor twitch that could be something random or the very earliest sign of HD.\n\nIn the UK we register with a particular doctor\u2019s surgery, and all appointments and referrals are made through them. Usually you see the same doctor each time, and I saw my GP in May to request that I get tested for HD. They sent a referral through the NHS that went to the regional genetics testing facility closest to where I live.\n\nJust over 3 weeks later I received a letter at home saying that my request couldn\u2019t be handled by some particular department and it was being forwarded somewhere else. Within a couple of weeks of that letter I received a follow up with an appointment date in August, from the same place that sent me the previous letter. Oh well, at least the journey was underway.\n\nThere was no interaction between the appointment letter I received in June and my first appointment, not that I expected there would be. The letter was literally turn up at this place and time and you will be seen by a genetic counsellor.\n\nSo come the day of my appointment and I meet with a genetic counsellor for the NHS. I outline why I\u2019m there (to be tested!) and that I\u2019m quite keen to get the whole process over with sooner rather than later, mainly because waiting for the results I said I would probably not be patient about, and it would be overly frustrating.\n\nA bit of background \u2013 my mother had HD. I\u2019ve known since before I was a teenager that I was at risk and it was 50/50 whether I would develop HD or not. Of my mother\u2019s siblings, exactly 50% developed HD and eventually died from it. So I was acutely aware of how it works, how HD progresses, what symptoms could manifest, the genetics behind it etc etc.\n\nI relayed all of the above to the counsellor and said that in my 20\u2019s it was discussed with me if I wanted to be tested, but I declined as I at least had enough self-awareness to realise that a bad result would probably ruin my life, even though I could have another 20+ years symptom-free. And that now I had reached a stage in my life when, for me, it was a complete no-brainer to get tested.\n\nI say a no-brainer as I\u2019m at the age when I would expect symptoms to start presenting now or within a couple of years, 5 at most. And that an adverse result would change nothing for me save giving me the opportunity to do things now that I might not otherwise be able to do later on.\n\nAll that was taken on board, and I asked if I could get the blood test done that day. My counsellor said that usually they ask for people to be seen three times and on the third time they would do the blood test and then about a month later be given the results. But in my case, she was happy to proceed with taking blood at my next appointment.\n\nSo there was a mixture of frustration and relief, but for them it\u2019s a non-negotiable condition that people are seen twice before any test is done. And I understand that now, certainly with more clarity than I did in August.\n\nDuring that first appointment I related my family history and we also discussed who else I had talked to about this. My family has been quite open about HD and we haven\u2019t kept it under wraps between us as I have read that some families do. Hence the awareness from a young age. I can only speak for myself when I say that I want to know these things and being kept in the dark only to find out later would have had a hugely detrimental effect on my relations with my family.\n\nThe other point my counsellor asked me was to bring a member of my family along or a friend to the next appointment. For the counsellor, it gives them some basis that I have support while going through this and in case I have an adverse result. And let\u2019s be straight here, it\u2019s not exactly something everyone will deal with objectively. I\u2019m sure people have harmed themselves or worse after testing positive for HD. \n\nThat was something I was happy to comply with, however I asked that a friend of mine come with me to my results appointment rather than the testing. I\u2019ve recently moved for work, so I needed to travel back to the testing centre and the friend I wanted there is someone I work with currently who I\u2019ve known for several years. \n\nWe left it there where I would see if my friend could make both but otherwise definitely be there for the testing. The other thing I was asked for was to provide some demonstrative evidence of HD in my family, so that they knew they were testing me for the right thing. I could have provided a number of things, but in the end it was easiest to send a copy of my mother\u2019s death certificate, which of course had HD listed on the certificate.\n\nThere were a couple of emails back and forth between my first and second appointments but mainly just scheduling. Most importantly I had an early appointment date set for my test and also to receive my results. I confirmed with the counsellor that it was ok to bring a friend to the results appointment rather than the testing and they were fine with that.\n\nCome the day of the second appointment I\u2019m seen by the same genetic counsellor along with an NHS doctor who is within the genetics team. The role of the doctor (other than to take blood for the test) was also to answer any further questions I had. I did have a couple of minor queries, mostly to do with the 36-39 repeat range and what percentage rates of HD applied to those values.\n\nIn both the first and second appointment we touched on what an adverse result would mean for me and what, if any, thinking I had done about how my life would change in that circumstance. I talked about how I currently drive to work and the type of job I do, both of which would have to change at some point if I have HD. I said that I identify quite strongly with my work and have made a lot of friends at the different places I\u2019ve worked, so losing that self-identity would be a blow. I was honest enough with them to say that prior to losing my independence I would be likely to visit a facility in Switzerland where you can end your life legally. The counsellor took that at face value and didn\u2019t offer any opinions. I\u2019ve mentioned that to two friends, neither of whom took it really well \u2013 but I don\u2019t blame them and hopefully it\u2019s a bridge I won\u2019t need to cross.\n\nNow I say hopefully but as I explained to the counsellor, I\u2019m of the opinion that I have HD. My coordination is fine, but other than the twitch I\u2019ve noticed a couple of little things that I feel are likely to be the very earliest first signs. However, I accept I could be completely wrong about that. And that is part of the reasoning for wanting to be tested, so I have some certainty because otherwise you\u2019d go bananas thinking about stuff like this assuming it\u2019s HD when it may be completely innocent things. They said from their point of view coming into this with an attitude like that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing as the adjustment from there to knowing you\u2019re getting HD after an adverse result is more easily dealt with than hoping nothing is there and finding out you\u2019re mistaken. So I\u2019m almost adopting an attitude of \u2018I have this and the testing process is just going to confirm what I kind of already know\u2019. And that was ok with them both.\n\nDuring the appointment we also phoned my friend just to touch base and ask if they had any questions for the team prior to the results appointment. Apparently some people have turned up with their support person to get results and the support person doesn\u2019t really know what is going on, leading to all sorts of questions that are probably best left alone until the adverse result can be processed mentally. So they had a chat with my friend and were happy that I\u2019d explained what HD was, what the test did and all the details around symptoms, progression and so on.\n\nAfter the call we talked a little about what would happen on results day. I asked them to just tell me the number of repeats. It\u2019s short, sharp and explains everything in an instant without any drama or delay. I\u2019ve asked them not to copy in my GP in my results, which they were happy to do. If I have an adverse result I\u2019ll be immediately referred to the nearest neurological dept where they have a team that specialises in HD and I\u2019ll go through a battery of tests. They said I\u2019d be welcome to come back and speak to them as often as I want afterwards, and usually the neurological visits are done once each year. I said I\u2019d want to explore any clinical trials that are taking place, which was fine and we left the discussion there as no point getting into details unless I have tested positive for HD.\n\nFinally it was the blood test - which if you\u2019ve ever had a needle to draw blood was exactly the same. They filled two vials and as I mentioned earlier, they noted on the form the date of my results appointment which is in mid October. I asked when they usually find out and they said often just a couple of days prior. So 4 weeks in the UK is the usual processing time to get DNA results back.\n\nI will say both appointments were handled really well and I did appreciate having both testing and results dates confirmed early on after my initial appointment. Having that timeframe locked in has helped a lot as I see an end to the waiting.

looking for any advice to help my wife.

She is not taking her medication and has been completely illogical since last week.  Today she began booking a cruise to 'get away' from me and anytime I leave she gets an uber to get more alcohol and cigarettes.  I came home from work early and attempted to have her mom and sister call her (both of them live out of state), but we are all 'against her' so it seems to only makes things worse.  \n\nThe situation is only going to continue without some sort of intervention on my part since I am the only person here to provide any care.  She receives treatment at a neurological center here, but they did not return my calls from 1pm today and are now closed (they said they'd urgently page a doctor or nurse and have them call me but I never heard back).  \n\nMy question is what, if any, are my options of putting her in a temporary mental health facility to sober her up (alcohol makes the HD much worse in her case) and not have her released on her own reconiscense since she will definitely do so at the first opportunity.  Can a doctor authorize a certain period of time she must stay?  I can wait until the morning to call again if so.  I know I can call 911 and possibly have a temporary mental health hold put on her, but if she doesn't get better in that time, I'm afraid it will get worse when she is released.\n\nAny advise is welcome.\n\nThanks.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 740, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Issues with HD wife (41 years old)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568165565, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/d20n9v/issues_with_hd_wife_41_years_old/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "therealwheat", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gnz8j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568054070, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/d1uyh7/just_waiting/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d1uyh7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/d1uyh7/just_waiting/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568054072, "score": 6, "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI've had a story similar to a lot of the stories I've read on here regarding HD and watching it affect my family.

She was unknowingly showing the beginning stages of her illness when all this was happening and became a bit abusive to me.

In the process most of our stuff had to be thrown away and a lot of my late father\u2019s stuff was thrown out too.

I just feel awful because she is almost at the last stage and won\u2019t be around much longer. I worry about regretting being resentful because she doesn\u2019t remember doing any of the abuse anyways, so there will never be any real closure for me. The worst part about this is that I really do not feel attached to her as a mother because of the abuse and I just want to move out and wash my hands with it for my own mental health.

Long story short he got diagnosed with Huntington's disease. Digging deeper into the family tree, we think it started with his dad, who then passed it along to my dad, my uncle, and both my aunts. It was at that point in my life at 18 that I knew I would get tested...I just didn't know when.\n\nFast forward 12 years and the time has come. I recently got married and I would not risk giving this destructive disease to any of my unborn children. So let's do this. I got prepared. I sharpened my mind, I read books, I convinced myself everything was fine. I told myself if I had it, then it would be at least 10-15 years before the symptoms manifest and science/medication would progress. I read the subreddits, researched early and late clinical trials, lived on HDBUZZ. I took the blood test on August 6th, 2019.  They told me to come back in 3 weeks to to get the results. Can you guys just tell me over the phone?! The drive is over an hour! \"No.\" \n\nMy Honeymoon was August 10th. Four days after giving my blood I was on a plane to Jamaica, Negril. I tried not to think about anything. I tried to enjoy myself. Negril was amazing; the 7 Mile Beach was incredible! We did cliff diving, snorkeling, cave swimming, ziplining! It was an unreal vacation from start to finish and we really enjoyed ourselves. The dark cloud I had over my life for the past 12 years were gone for that week. It was too beautiful and sunny in Jamaica to be worried about \"dark clouds.\" One night we got hit with their quick tropical storms. It didn't rain for that long, but that rain brought with it those dark clouds I seemed to have forgotten. Almost.\n\nBack home, August 17th; back to reality. Worked the week as usual and got ready for my fantasy football drafts. I'm in three leagues, and I look forward to them every year. They're fun and they make games you normally wouldn't want to watch enjoyable, you know? For the next week straight I thought more about Huntington's than I did in my entire life. Probably because of how I don't like seeing my dad like that, a shell of himself. Probably because no one should have to go through all the bullshit my mom goes through. Probably because I have a younger brother who thinks these same thoughts yet  we've never talked to each other about them other than grazing the subject. I hate this disease. Everyone in this thread knows what it does to families so I'll skip that but from the little comfort I could take...it was in knowing that if I had this disease it would die with me and our kids would be in the clear. \n\nResults are in. I actually slept like a baby the night before. The days leading up were bad nights of sleep but last night was a good one. Worked in the morning, picked the wife up from work and headed over to the Huntington center to see the results. Car ride was on the silent side, little quick topics here and there. There was a ton of traffic, or maybe it was regular traffic and I was just annoyed; the radio was off and it was the longest fucking car ride ever. I made a promise to myself to be strong in front of my wife. \n\nIn the waiting room, I had to piss like a race horse. So did my wife. As soon as I sat down after using the bathroom, I was called into the room. Our geneticist is amazing. She's sweet and bubbly and on August 6th on my initial visit I was making them laugh and cracking jokes and it was a great time considering the circumstances. There's a little history with us since they know my dad who goes there and my mom who always brings them food. That's the Lebanese in her. Today wasn't like that. She was stone faced. \"Hopefully you didn't think about this too much on your honeymoon.\" \"Tried not to,\" I said, even though I did. She was serious, and I was nervous. Breathe. \n\nShe got right to the point. I sat on the chair. Before I could even process what was going on, she was screaming. \"You are SO negative! You could have babies! We're so happy for you guys!!\" \n\n   Flooded with emotions. Flooded....like FLOODED! I thank God in my results. I took it hard. I was so convinced I had it, that I never prepared for not having it. It's so crazy to even try to explain or put in words. We were overwhelmed. Shocked. \n\nI'd like anyone that's going back and forth with getting tested, to get tested! Trust me, knowing is better than not either way. If you know, you can prepare. They have amazing clinical trials and Huntington's Disease is receiving some of the biggest breakthroughs in research in the last 50 years. I'm fully convinced within the next 3-5 years we will be able to completely treat it. If it's not a burden on your life and you're living at risk, then I would say continue doing what makes you happy.

Apparently, my husband's grandfather had HD and passed away at age 94. When he died (4 years ago) the family mentioned he'd had some sort of disease but they never openly discussed it with my husband or his twin sister, so we never realised the gravity of this diagnosis. \n\nMy husband's auntie (68) tested negative, but my mother-in-law (64) is undecided whether to take the test, so we don't know if she has it or not. I don't know when my husband's grandfather started displaying symptoms.\n\nMy mother-in-law has suffered from depression for a long time (is on anti-depressants) and, in social situations, drinks a lot. Other than depression I can't say we've noticed any other symptoms of HD - and to be fair depression can obviously be caused by a huge range of things. Although during the wedding day she was acting a bit odd, we put this down to her drinking too much (and mixing with anti-depressants). It was also a stressful situation for her as her ex (my husband's father) was there. A couple of months ago she slipped on a wet floor and broke her ankle so was in a boot and was in pain with that during the day too.\n\nIt's so hard because whilst I'm aware that my mother-in-law has a 50% chance of having HD and her behavior \\*could\\* be caused by this, I also feel like how she was behaving at the wedding could all be unrelated to HD. I guess I'm trying to look for answers/a positive when we'll never know until we know her diagnosis, which at the moment she is reluctant to find out.\n\nThis brings me on to my husband. For context, I am 30 and he is 31. We started TTC last year (before being aware of the HD in his family) and we had a miscarriage in May. This hit us very hard and just as we were finally feeling like we were up for TTC again, we've been hit with this news about HD and it's like we've run head-first into a brick wall. \n\nWe've been looking into all our options and think that non-disclosure PGD IVF will likely be our route forward so my husband doesn't have to find out if he has HD. We've taken the steps to speak to our GPs and have been referred to genetics services (no date for a consultation yet) - we're doing everything we can to move forwards. I just feel so gutted that we came so close to starting our family and now we not only have to put that on hold, we also have to get our heads around the potential of my husband possibly having HD.\n\nI'm so angry that HD wasn't spoken about more openly within his family and that my husband, or his sister, was never made aware of what this means for them, or the potential impact it could have on trying to start a family. My sister-in-law is 31 (husband and she are twins) and she is desperate to start a family too. Knowing that it could be at least 12-18 months before we're even in a position to be getting pregnant feels heartbreaking right now. I wish we knew for sure if my husband's mother has HD as I feel this would help give us more clarity on a way forwards - as part of me still wants to try and conceive naturally.\n\nI'm not really looking for advice (although it's welcome if you have any!) I just needed a place to write down my thoughts. In the last 3 weeks, our world has been turned upside down. I love my husband so much and whilst initially, we were more concerned about the impact of this news on us starting a family, it's really starting to hit me about what this means for him and us if he does have HD.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1327, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My husband could be at risk but we want to start a family", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/plok8f/my_husband_could_be_at_risk_but_we_want_to_start/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "it_just_happened", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_aop9e", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1631128863, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/pkhaeu/roche_hoping_to_move_on_from_recent_failure_pens/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pkhaeu", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/pkhaeu/roche_hoping_to_move_on_from_recent_failure_pens/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1631128874, "score": 1, "selftext": "After the tominersen flop, Roche is looking at this Huntington\u2019s pact a little differently.

My mom's side of the family passed the gene down to me and I have lost pretty much all of that side of my family including my mom to the disease. I am a junior python programmer that has an interest in Machine Learning and am taking classes on AI Engineering and ML and Deep Learning. I want to build a linear regression model that could possibly predict onset of symptoms or even approximate age of mortality for people like me in order to hopefully help people like me have some closure or at least some answers to this monster of a disease. Please note that there is no such thing as a 100% accurate model but I aim to try and get the highest accuracy I can get with my model. My friends and I will be working on the program but are in need of a dataset which we could run through our model to train it for prediction. What we are looking at needing right now is completely 100% superficial information from volunteers of 3 simple fields: Age, Age of Onset, and CAG count. No names have to be disclosed and we can simply refer to each subject as subject \"A B C D\" etc etc and send each person their approximate result via those code identifiers. It's completely voluntary and can be anonymous if that makes people feel safer but we are desperately in need of data. Also what we need to train it with would be family history, such as just like... say a person has a family member who passed, all we would need is CAG (if possible), Age of Onset, age of passing. No names once again, but we could \"theoretically\" train our model with that information to make the prediction with the volunteers personal superficial information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe implications of this project could be a huge breakthrough in HD as you know not much is known especially about mortality and we are given almost no answers when we are diagnosed and pretty much just left to wonder and be terrified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease I sincerely want to assure everyone, I'm not trying to get any \"personal\" private sensitive information from anyone, all we are hoping for is those three fields mentioned above. This is a nonprofit private project, no data is shared with anyone. It's strictly for testing purposes. My team sincerely hopes that we can get volunteers, as this is a very important project. We plan to study Machine Learning intensively even as we are doing our studies in order to achieve the highest possible accuracy we can and plan to do live broadcasts when we are programming our models in order to educate people and the world about Huntington's Disease.   \n\n\nIf interested, please feel free to comment or DM. No private info is needed, heck not even your name if you don't want to share.

My mom is hopefully a few good years off from me needing to make this decision but I was hoping to gather some information from this community and those who have been through it. When your loved one entered the later stages, did you decide on using a feeding tube? Why or why not? \n\nMy mom refuses to discuss anything about her future with these disease. When we do it sends her into a deep depression. Makes things harder for me but I\u2019m prepared to make these decisions for her if it allows her to live these years in denial. If that makes sense. I know my mom pretty well and I am confident about any other potential decisions I may have to make except this one. \n\nResearch I\u2019ve done online tells me to consider when the benefits of feeding are no longer present. I honestly struggle to find a reason that it would be a benefit in the first place - the outcome is inevitable and there\u2019s no chance of improvement. But maybe I\u2019m misguided with that thinking\u2026\n\nThe reason I got thinking about this in the first place was I saw a tik tok account with a young guy who\u2019s mom was in LTC with a PEG tube. Completely bed ridden, non verbal, looking very rigid. It kinda shook me a bit even though I know what\u2019s coming.

I (31F) found out a little over a month ago that my great uncle (75) on my father's side was just diagnosed. Started showing movement symptoms \\~5 years ago. His sister, my grandmother (78), may be showing symptoms - things like cognitive decline and unsteadiness that her doc previously attributed to her other health problems and med side effects, but could be HD related now that there's family history. I just found out that she won't be able to see a neurologist until January to be evaluated and tested.\n\nMy husband and I were just starting TTC, but have put it on hold as I firmly believe I need to know my status before we make any decisions (CVS, PGD IVF, etc.). I do have an active referral to Mass General's HD COE for genetic counseling, but no appointment yet.\n\nGetting to the point - has anyone tried to begin the genetic counseling and/or testing process before having an \"immediate\" family be diagnosed? I'm worried that I won't be able to start my own process until hers is complete, assuming she's gene positive. I know for sure that I want the information and it's devastating to think we might be waiting well into next year to know whether and how we can start a family.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this? \n\nAlso curious if anyone has seen consistent late onset in a family - my father is 57, his sisters are \\~45 and \\~59, all with no symptoms. I know I'm looking for signs, but wouldn't it be odd for 1.) my grandmother to show symptoms so late in life and 2.) for none of her children to show signs yet if she is positive?\n\nTIA for any advice!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1301, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do you need an immediate family diagnosis to get tested?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/p3nzkv/do_you_need_an_immediate_family_diagnosis_to_get/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Niatrii", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_dd3tuuts", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1628823002, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/p3etlj/is_it_true_that_doctors_wont_test_you_if_you_dont/", "gildings": {}, "id": "p3etlj", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/p3etlj/is_it_true_that_doctors_wont_test_you_if_you_dont/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1628823013, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1301, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is it true that doctors won't test you if you don't have symptoms?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/p3etlj/is_it_true_that_doctors_wont_test_you_if_you_dont/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "thebushwacker2000", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8qwfn", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1628811113, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/p3blcj/relationship_advice_me_venting/", "gildings": {}, "id": "p3blcj", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/p3blcj/relationship_advice_me_venting/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1628811124, "score": 1, "selftext": "Long story short I met a girl and immediately fell head over heels for her.

My grandfather had it, and my mom has it, and I have a 50% chance of having it. She developed symptoms at 53, and is almost 74 now...needs care as she cannot walk, has trouble with hand movements, speech, and some memory issues, but is still mostly in good spirits. Fortunately, she had a late onset version of it which is less severe than someone with earlier symptoms or higher repeat numbers. However, like Huntington's, there is no cure and no drug to slow the progression, although clinical trials are underway. People tend to live 10-30 years after onset of symptoms, depending on many things.\n\nI am 40, and so far have had no symptoms, never been tested, but I do question every little thing I experience. I do have two kids under the age of 10, and I knew of my chances before then. We decided to have kids anyway as it appeared a late onset disease. However, since I saw my mom decline quite a bit since COVID, and I started to notice a minor bit of double vision (unsure if it's new or always been there and I never noticed it, but it can be an early symptom), the thought has crossed my mind multiple times that maybe I do have it and have more repeats and therefore an earlier onset of symptoms, and feel a sense of dread that my kids would get it and have symptoms even earlier than that....I know, it's a train of dark thoughts, and I do not see a reddit group for this type of disease, but since there are many comparisons between this disease and Huntington's, I thought I'd try asking here. I went to a genetic counselor to weigh the pros and cons, and will soon speak to a therapist who specializes in cases like this. Optometrist didn't see anything that alarming except some minor esophoria, but didn't notice any other symptoms (plus, I wonder if eyes changing at 40 is contributing to this, plus being at a computer all day).\n\nHowever, my question is for people who opted to do pre-symptomatic testing. Obviously, we all want to hear a negative result, but if you had a positive result, did you wish you hadn't of tested and was it awfully hard to adjust? I feel almost ready to know myself, but the thought of suddenly knowing I had a 50% chance of passing it to each kid makes me feel a great sense of guilt, and that if I had a positive result, I would suddenly lose the ability to assure myself \"maybe I don't have it\". I know that even with a positive result, it wouldn't mean that the things I'm experiencing are necessarily related, but feel I'm at a crossroads as to if I'm ready to hear the news, or enjoy the next few years with the kids with not knowing....I do have an appointment with Vision Therapist and Neurologist to get a baseline and see if they see anything I don't see.

Last night I found out by accident that my mom has HD. I'm horrified.\n\nI've always known that my grandmother has it and it's horrible to see what it's done to her. Now I'm going to have to watch my mom go through that and it may happen to me too.\n\nMy mom has had a big personality change over the past few years. Me and my dad honest to God thought she had BPD but now that I've read more into HD I think it may be depression due to knowing her fate or the personality changes that can happen with HD\n\nI'm scared. I have a 50% chance of having it. So do my two siblings. I don't want to live like her. She hasn't shown any physical symptoms but she's become unbearable to be around personality wise for long periods of time.\n\nIt feels like I'm fucked any way I go about it. If I don't have it then I'm gonna be living all fine and dandy while my mom and possibly siblings suffer and if I do have if I'm going to suffer.\n\nI take a lot after my mom. I look almost exactly like her, we have similar mannerisms and I got her anxiety and clumsiness.\n\nMy mental health has never been the best. I was extremely anxious as a child (still am if you couldn't tell lmao) and started having suicidal thoughts and self harming at age 11. The suicidal thoughts stopped after around 2ish years but now I'm starting to feel like killing myself is a better option again now. I'm literally at a Waterpark with my friends right now and all I can think about is being scared of HD and wanting to die.\n\nI've always wanted to have children one day but I'm already starting to give up on that dream. I don't want to possibly pass this down to my kids and even if I don't have it there's still mental illnesses I don't want to pass down. I know adoption is an option but even then, if I have it I don't want any future kids to have to see my like this.\n\nI'm about to burst into tears. Last night I couldn't sleep and was teetering between \"live the best life you can\" and \"give up on your dreams and die\", and now I'm leaning more towards the latter. I'm fucking done. My mom refuses to admit to me that she has it and there's no way in hell either if my parents are going to let me test until I'm old enough to do it on my own. I doubt there's gonna be a cure in my lifetime so I'm probably going to end up having a long, miserable death like my mother and grandmother if I have it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1278, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I want to cry constantly", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/oq4gxb/i_want_to_cry_constantly/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DevTheDummy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9htnhakr", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1627044940, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/oq1the/i_just_found_out_my_mom_has_huntingtons_and_now/", "gildings": {}, "id": "oq1the", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/oq1the/i_just_found_out_my_mom_has_huntingtons_and_now/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1627044951, "score": 1, "selftext": "Title essentially\n\nMy grandmother has it and I always suspected my mom had it but I just got it confirmed whenever I overheard her talking about it just a minute ago.

I also rock back and forth in my seat, move my foot, bounce my leg and other things. I feel completely fine physically. I workout, I sing and speak clearly (unlike my granny, unfortunately) and I'm a bit clumsy, but I've always been that way.

They doctors tried a few diagnosis until they did a genetic test and I was a positive for HD. I didn't think too much about it because I didn't want to worry about it. 1 year ago, 5 years into the disease, it's was clear to me that the tremors had worsened to an extent and I was being much clumsier compared to the previous years. I'd get severe panic attacks from thinking about the future and despite therapy nothing has helped. About 1 year ago during lockdown I was basically losing my mind and I decided to make some changes in my life. I don't have any family and nobody depends on me so I decided to quit my job and sink into drugs, alcohol and promiscuous sex. For the past year I've only hung around with low lives from Tinder, did a lot of cocaine and I've been having a lot of good time. I have a house I inherited from my mother when she passed away from cancer and I've been living off my saving that can last me a few years still. My days boil down to eating junk food, finding someone on Tinder to fuck me like I'm some kind of blow up doll, doing drugs and sleeping when the sun in rising. I'm not stupid and I know this lifestyle is not healthy and that kind the point. I want it to kill me before HD. I am also not telling anyone to cope with the disease like I'm doing, this is just how I decided to end it. Every time I get tremors I smoke weed so I can stop thinking about it. Despite being shitfaced half the time I still prefer this over being sober and aware of what's going on.

I had a brain scan; no tumors. Everyone says the tremor is from anxiety. I have had anxiety since I was a child. Extreme depression for as long as I can remember. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was stable on medication (Vraylar, extended release Xanax, birth control, hydroxyzine for anxiety attacks, vyvanse and Adderall for concentration) for awhile -not happy. In fact, I ended up extremely depressed and got off of them. Before that the only antidepressant that i responded to was amitriptyline. I have tried so many medications for my mental health and somethings i have reverse reaction to but most just don\u2019t work. I am with a psychiatrist now working on getting a GeneSight Test to find out a med that works. They have now labeled me with just mood disorder which means they don\u2019t know what kind because i cycle between impulsive and miserable so quickly and often. It doesn\u2019t fit classic bipolar timeline. I started needing uppers because i was on so many downers (i thought) the adderall and vyvanse have been helpful to keeping me going but I still don\u2019t focus well. My memory has gotten so hazy. It comes and it goes. I blamed it on being a side effect from medication but now that I\u2019ve been off the meds for almost 3 months it\u2019s not gotten better. Some days I think worse. \n\nNeither of my parents have HD (no one in my family i know of at all) but my dad recently (9 months ago) got a really high fever and seems to have lost a good bit of his memory. (It has hardly returned) He\u2019s always had a sleep disorder that doctors haven\u2019t been able to diagnose. He doesn\u2019t go into REM sleep. So doctors blamed the memory loss on the no sleep. \nMy mom always tells me I probably have Parkinson\u2019s which is bullying right?

We're trying to move out ASAP for many reasons, ultimately for baby because the stress here is unfathomable and there will be no room when they arrive. If I could pick up my things and move out today just to get away from this situation, I would do so in a heartbeat.\n\nJ has been on a quick steady decline since the beginning of lockdown and more recently in the past few months has declined a lot quicker. Every day J enters psychotic episodes for hours on end wailing and screaming about how we don't care and everything is our fault which is unequivocally false, our worlds have to revolve around her. She is set off by the tiniest things, for example in the 27\u00b0C heat last week, we could only have the windows open a crack because she thinks she's cold when actually she can't regulate her body temp and is sweating uncontrollably. Unsurprisingly she had heat stroke the next day. We are all kept under her thumb, we can't do anything without it causing a meltdown.\n\nJ is a position where she clearly needs care from a supporting agency or dare I say it, needs to be in a home but dad won't chase up Social Services from their last meeting in Feb saying they would send a carer round while he was at work, after that meeting all correspondence with them stopped and J has certainly declined further since then.\n\nMy dad has just accepted that this is how she is now and is on the edge of a carer breakdown. He doesn't care about the state of the house (my partner and I try to keep on top of things as much as possible but we worry about how things will be when we leave), he's given up caring about himself too, it's almost like he's just trying to get to the end of the day from the moment he wakes up.\n\nEvery time I try to light a fire up his butt for him to get some support and make a log of everything J does as supporting evidence, I'm shrugged off and he deals with it by making jokes or huffing and walking away, he won't help himself or us.

This results in many of us having heard the question \"What is Huntington's?\" numerous times.\n\nPersonally I avoid the subject among friends and acquaintances, as I find it uncomfortable to discuss and a kind of depressing topic to talk about. But sometimes that conversation will lead towards the other person mentioning that they've heard that a genetic disease is running in my family, or that my mom is sick. Or sometimes I'll be busy due to having to take care of my mom, and I'll have to explain my reason for why i'll be absent from a social gathering, meeting or whatever. You get the gist, there are many situations where the conversation might lead to that question.\n\nI could decline to answer, of course, but that just seems rude. The question generally makes me uncomfortable when it's from somebody I don't know too well and I don't wanna make a bad impression on them. Responding with \"just Google it\" seems kinda rude aswell, if I'm not in a hurry.\n\nI've been looking for something short and concise to avoid the convesation from steering any further into the topic, but haven't had great success so far. I've been thinking about using \"It's like ALS combined with Dementia\", but I don't know if that's an accurate depiction of HD since I don't know a lot about those two other diseases.\n\nI guess I'm a bit socially inept so I'm probaby overthinking this lol, but I think it's important to spread awareness aswell so I don't really want to avoid the topic altogether.

I also see that every single person I've worked with wants to communicate, whether it be through eye contact, movements, slight gestures, single words, or their own special way of communicating. There's so many different ways we can communicate! \n\nI walk into these individuals rooms every day and see their lives in pictures on their walls. Their families, places they've been, their life accomplishments, likes and dislikes. I think it's truly eye opening to see these individuals lives before this disease has brought them to the need for long term care. \n\nI do my best everyday to give ample time, take individuals out of their rooms, and even if they stare at me blankly, talk to them just as I would with anyone else. In fact, this wonderful man I work with knows my whole life story by now! \n\nPlease, feel free to provide me with education, tools, and knowledge from your point of view.

Before my dad got diagnosed, my mom was in the midst of filing for divorce. She waited to see what the diagnosis was before she proceeded. Obviously, with this being the outcome, she didn\u2019t go thru with it. \n\nMy dad is not exactly a nice person.  He never physically hurt my mom, myself or any of my siblings. It was all a mind game. He\u2019d gaslight the shit out of you. Follow you around saying horrible things under his breath, and stop as soon as someone else was nearby. \nThat kind of shit. \nHe\u2019s an alcoholic grouch with a short fuse who put my mother and I thru hell. \n(Not sure why it was just 2/6)\n\nEven with his Huntington\u2019s progressing, quickly as he is still drinking, he still manages to make my mom feel terrible, as if she personally did this to him. He can\u2019t  drive, so all day he is at home watching re-runs and throwing away our possessions at random. My mom does her best to stay busy and out of the house, even getting a part time job, but he always manages to find a way to ruin her day.\n\n My siblings and I all have jobs/families/responsibilities and as you can imagine, spending time with my dad is emotionally draining and I usually need to look at baby animal videos after.\n\nHe needs a caretaker. Not so much to take care of him in the traditional sense, but like an assistant or a butler of sorts. Someone to keep him company and make sure he doesn\u2019t get hurt or lost or end up on the news. Unfortunately, he is not open to the idea because, \u201che\u2019s fine\u201d. \n\nHe\u2019s not fine. \n\nHe\u2019s spending too much time alone and he\u2019s turning into some sort of super villain with the dark backstory. \n\nThere are a few agencies where we live, that would send over a person to basically be a buddy. The issue isn\u2019t accessibility. It\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t want help and if we try and force it, he\u2019s going to make my mother even more miserable. \n\nVictims shouldn\u2019t have to care for their abuser. We\u2019ve all seen that movie.  It doesn\u2019t end well for anybody.\n\nHow do we get him to meet with the caregiver/agency/butler service without him unleashing over-the-top rage on his well-intentioned family? \n\n\nPlease send help.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1245, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Butler interviews", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/o0yc84/butler_interviews/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "JusticeAvenger618", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7cpr80xu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1623628326, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/nz9fx8/does_anyone_know_if_the_huntingtons_society/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nz9fx8", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/nz9fx8/does_anyone_know_if_the_huntingtons_society/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1623662248, "score": 1, "selftext": "Or are there any other options?\n\nI think I read they more want us to give them money for membership etc But I don't know where else to turn.

How does a town of a 100k just NOT DO THIS RESOURCE? Literally EVERYONE says they stopped doing them because addicts traded them for cash.

It came as a complete shock to us and we didn\u2019t really understand at the time what the future would hold. Now that her symptoms are getting worse the amount of depression and anxiety I feel is constant and debilitating knowing what the next 5-10 years hold for us.\n\nFor context, the current situation is my mom lives at home with her two dogs and my dad. They are married still but they have more of a contractually obligated relationship. My dad (65) works during the day on the farm, then makes sure she has something for supper and they spend the evenings watching tv together with the dogs. She\u2019s had 2 falls in the house but is still able to walk independently (with some difficulty and chorea as I\u2019m sure you all know about). She doesn\u2019t cook or drive anymore but is able to bathe, do laundry, look after the dogs and prepare small snacks for herself. She texts me and we talk on the phone every night. I\u2019m able to get home every 2-4 weeks for a few days currently\u2026. Beside me, my dad, her brother and sister and law (who live far away) she doesn\u2019t have much of a support system. She wants to keep her diagnosis a secret as much as possible so she doesn\u2019t like going out much or talking to others. Her mental state is usually pretty good and she is adamant that her happy place is on the farm with the dogs and wants to stay there as long as possible. \n\nI will summarize my main worries, and if anyone has any words of wisdom to pass on I would be so, so grateful. I feel so alone. \n\n1. I (23) am in medical school in a city 2.5hrs away. I feel so much regret and guilt over choosing this path. I always thought it was what I wanted but now that I\u2019m not able to be home very much I feel overwhelming sadness and guilt that I\u2019m not able to spend these last few \u201cgood\u201d years with her\u2026 but on the other hand she is so proud of me and would feel so horrible if I gave it up on account of her. \n\n2. None of the family wanting to be her caregiver. It seems like most posts I see someone in the family whether it be a child or partner are willing to be the full time caregiver. My family doesn\u2019t want to do that. We are considering bringing in home care to bridge the gap between her symptoms getting bad (unable to bathe or walk around the house) and the need for 24 hr supervision and care. But the stigma and guilt around passing the care to someone else make me feel like a shitty child. \n\n3. I feel sadness and guilt every time I do something that brings me happiness. When I go back to my own house and spend time with my partner and dog or my friends and I find myself enjoying myself and being happy for once my mind immediately goes back to thinking \u201cbut mom and dad are at home, alone and suffering through this without me and I don\u2019t deserve to be having fun when I\u2019ve left that burden at home\u201d. \n\nI have a therapist I\u2019m working with but wait times between appointments are long.

And before that, how often are JHD patients actually in the hospital and for what reason? Most of what I've read/seen, I see patients at home with their families, but I'm having a hard time finding much information of people with JHD and I'm not as educated as I would like to be on how stark the difference between the two are.\n\nAlso, when HD patients reach final stages, life expectancy less than 6 months, from what I've researched it seems like they're able to choose if they would like to stay under intensive care or in the comfort of their own home for their last moments. To me this doesn't seem to make much sense because most HD patients are unable to eat, walk, or move much in general. \n\nI'm also sorry if any of this comes off as insensitive!

I (23F) just recently discovered this sub after learning about the existence of HD in my family. From the limited information I recently learned from my mom, my paternal great-grandmother had HD and passed away from it, her daughter/my paternal grandfather\u2019s sister had it and  passed away from it, and my father\u2019s cousins both have it and one has already passed away from it. My paternal grandfather is in his early 70s, has had some varying health issues over the years, and, as far as I know, he has not had any testing done. However, he is also the type to not let anyone know if anything is wrong and is also the type who hasn\u2019t been to the doctor in 20 years. For the past few years, his life has been pretty consumed with taking care of my grandmother who is older than him and has been declining in health (recently diagnosed with dementia). \n\nWhere I am concerned is the fact that my father passed away when I was five years old. My father was 32 when he passed from a brain hemorrhage and organ failure stemming from complications with the Type 1 Diabetes he had since he was 13 y/o. Thus, there is no way of knowing if he had HD and if I am at risk, other than by looking at my grandfather. My father was my grandfather\u2019s only biological child.\n\nAlthough my grandfather is seemingly fine, I have read about it appearing late in life, as well as the \u201cindeterminate range\u201d. I don\u2019t want to ask him about any of it due to everything going on right now with my grandmother. Should I even be remotely concerned about having the gene? Should I consider testing since my father is deceased and so much is unknown? \n\nI apologize for the lengthy post, and I am truly so sorry for what each of you are going through. From my limited knowledge of the disease and it\u2019s effects on my family members, I see how horrible it is.

His father has pretty much been in prison his whole life. They don\u2019t really have a relationship, but he called my partner recently and revealed that he has Huntington\u2019s. Spiraled out that night, and have been learning as much as I can lately without burdening my partner with information overload. He\u2019s estranged from family, so it would be hard to get anyone\u2019s information or records. I did some sleuthing and found out his grandfather died of it at 70, and at least another uncle did at 87. His dad is in his mid-50s and says he doesn\u2019t feel any different... but who knows how long he has had it anyway. Partner is 29. Now we are in a catch-22 with all of this and testing... he feels fine, so why go and test and then be burdened with that knowledge. But with a child, the unknown can be a bad thing. Baby was a (happy) accident, as I had been told ai couldn\u2019t have children. Now I feel so guilty about something that I suppose was out of my control.

What were the struggles you faced?\n* How do you move forward in your day-to-day life with a positive diagnosis, or living in an HD family? \n* How has it changed your life to have - or to love someone who has - HD?\n* What has been the scariest [or any other adjective... craziest, funniest, wildest, most confusing, etc.] part of your HD journey?\n* How do you feel about the current research and drug trials? Have you participated in any? Are you hopeful for the future of HD treatments?\n* What kind of stigma have you or your family members endured?

Except, I wasn\u2019t because I panicked every time I forgot a word, or stumbled, or did anything my brain thought was a symptom. So I\u2019ve made the decision to get tested at the end of this year. \n\nPart of what informed that decision was my choice to begin therapy so that I\u2019m able to deal with my diagnosis; positive or negative. Right now, I\u2019m not able to fully confront the idea of being positive, but I am able to take more steps in that direction than I was before I started therapy. Right now, I\u2019ve decided to live my life as if I were to test positive as living in limbo has honestly kept me spiraling a lot harder than I realized. \n\nAll of that leads to a seemingly insignificant question, but an important one. What things do I need to consider in terms of financial future when I comes to a positive result? I\u2019m fortunate in that my husband is in the military, so I do have good health insurance and know that money will be okay, but I also need to work so I won\u2019t go insane sitting around the house. I\u2019m more curious about life insurance, 401k\u2019s, saving plans, investing, bonds?? Things of those nature, because honestly, I haven\u2019t really had the wherewithal to do anything about this kind of stuff because I thought that I\u2019d I just saved enough money I\u2019d be okay. \n\nI\u2019m aware that family planning is a big part of this, and decisions like this, but I can\u2019t approach that subject without feeling a little broken, so I\u2019m just looking for a starting point.

The last 24 hours have become a blur. I married the love of my life 5 years ago. She is the most amazing human being on this planet.  She adopted our teenage daughter right after we were married.  I was a single,hard working parent when I met her. The cosmic cluster fuck of how we met is a different story in itself.  \n\n    My amazing wife has never known who her father was. She was fine with it, I was fine with it.  She is 29 but madly successful.  She is the smartest person I know! We had done 23&amp;me a few years ago and had a few hits. We did not think much of it and kind of joked about her second family.  \n\n  Last night through a series of extreme coincidences we found out her biological father passed away from HD. Like fall on your lap and punch you in the face coincidences.  It was a few weeks ago. My wife and I were freaking out. Long story short My wife's father passed from HD. Her new found siblings are diagnosed with HD. We are seeking a genetic counselor.  But mother fucking fuck! We were cool the day before.  This shit did not even exist.  \n\n  She went full csi mode on the family tree. 70% have hd. We are worried for her. I keep saying it is 50-50. That doesn't help. Today has been full of uncontrollable crying for something that may not exist.  As well as uncontrollable laughing because I am going to love my wife like never before.  If you know us, its impossible.  We are so tight and so much in sync.  Noone has the love we got. \n\n  Long story short,  we have nobody to talk to about this. It is highly probable she has hd. There have been mini symptoms but who doesn't have symptoms to everything.  .. I am scared,  I am buzzed, I am listening to my one true solemate snore next to me. \n\nHow can I fix this? Help?

Have had issues with cognitive impairment for about 5 years now though.\n\nI was doing some research the last year and found something you folks might find interesting.\n\nA company called Mitochon Pharmaceutical has been working on a treatment for Huntington\u2019s called MP101. Here\u2019s a link to the conclusions of some studies they\u2019ve done https://www.mitochonpharma.com/pipeline/ .\n\nMP101 seemed to preserve brain volume, neuron integrity, improved motor function, and significantly reduced free radicals in the human cortex, all in mouse models of Huntington\u2019s.\n\nBasically the MP101 increases brain protection to a really high degree.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s really interesting.\n\nMP101 isn\u2019t a new drug. It\u2019s been around for almost a century. It\u2019s actual name is 2,4-dinitrophenol. In the 30\u2019s it was used as a weight loss drug, in doses of 200mg and more. It worked extremely well, dangerously well. Overdoses caused mitochondrial toxicity that resulted in people literally overheating to death. Long term use at these high doses also increased the chance for cataracts. The drug was taken off the market and shelved for decades. People today still sell it illegally to dedicated bodybuilders because there is no more effective method of losing weight in a short amount of time.\n\nResearchers began to look at it again when they figured out something incredible. At very low doses, the drug had entirely different effects. It acted as a mild stressor to mitochondria directly, and like as with fasting or exercise, the body responded with powerful anti-stress and resilience mechanisms. Increased neuroprotection being a huge one of them.\n\nThe implications of this are explained here https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6468406/ .\n\nAs I said, I\u2019ve had issues with cognitive impairment for 5 years now. These include memory lapses, issues with executive functions, damaged working memory, etc. I\u2019ve also had long stretches of depression and anxiety.\n\nI had tried a lot of meds as treatment with very marginal benefits, the impairments were still hampering my work as well as my personal life.\n\nSo I did something very risky and what was probably one of the best decisions of my life. After doing my research, I went and obtained some 2,4-dinitrophenol from a bodybuilding source and began dosing it at 3 milligrams per day. Almost every issue I had with cognitive impairment is gone now, after 3 months of consistent daily dosing. This is not an endorsement or a suggestion, this is just me reporting my anecdotal experience. I\u2019m very grateful for finding it.\n\nHD deserves better treatments and research. I\u2019m hoping for everyone\u2019s sake that MP101 clears human trials and does well, and that some day everyone has the chance to experience to same healing I did.\n\nThanks for reading, and my best wishes to all of you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1081, "subreddit_type": "public",

He was already diagnosed with vascular dementia in June \u201819 and the HD diagnosis came as a shock. I had no idea what HD was when they told us about it in his appointment and firstly assumed it was a type of dementia. My dads father died in his 50\u2019s from cancer and my dads mother lived until she was 83 so I think it was his father that had it. My dads grandmother committed suicide so the reason it has gone undetected in our family is probably because of a lack of awareness. \n\nAlthough my dad got tested at 63, looking back on it I believe he\u2019s been displaying symptoms for a good 10-15 years. He\u2019s always had huge problems with getting into debts, he would get a \u00a340 parking fine and then ignore it and it would turn into a CCJ of \u00a33,000. There were always bailiffs turning up. His driving was also horrendous and he would always run out of petrol 30 miles from home and have to rescued on the motorway. He once forgot which car park he\u2019d parked his car so had to go round all the car parks to find it. I was only in my late teens during all this and my dad was very good at brushing everything under the carpet because he was always so cheerful about his mishaps and would joke about them. I feel really horribly guilty that I didn\u2019t pick up on it all these years but we had no idea of a family history of HD. His symptoms were never (and still aren\u2019t) physical - ie no shaking, no speech problems etc. It seems it was all more cognitive. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to post this here as I know this is a great community of people who are in the same boat as myself. I\u2019m getting tested as soon as I\u2019ve sorted my life insurance and my brother has already tested negative. My fathers two siblings are also getting tested but as they\u2019re in their 60s now with no symptoms I\u2019m thinking they should be ok.\n\n\nETA: My dads also currently in the hospital where he\u2019s been diagnosed with heart failure due to the HD.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Huntingtons", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1063, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Dad (63) was diagnosed with HD with no known family history", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/jwfp1x/dad_63_was_diagnosed_with_hd_with_no_known_family/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "s_gksl", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7vk1vueh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605697088, "domain": "self.Huntingtons", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/jwdrc4/a_short_survey_on_hd_testing/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jwdrc4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Huntingtons/comments/jwdrc4/a_short_survey_on_hd_testing/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1605713521, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a PhD candidate at London Business School.

We are looking to reach people who have either taken a genetic test or consider taking it.\n\nIf you have 10 minutes to spare, I would really appreciate to get your opinions on this topic! As soon as we have enough data, we hope to share our research findings with everyone with the hopes to benefit the HD society.\n\nMany thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Survey information:**\n\nI am a Professor of Marketing at London Business School, in the U.K., doing research on consumer behaviour. With Nazli Gurdamar and Selin Goksel, PhD candidates, I have been studying how knowing in advance about an undesirable future event, such as learning that one is certain to develop a genetic disease, influences people\u2019s wellbeing before and after that event. We are currently running a survey with Huntington's Disease Association UK, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Canada, and USA to investigate people\u2019s attitudes towards taking the test for Huntington\u2019s Disease and the consequences of testing on their subjective well-being. \n\nThe purpose of our inquiry is to reach out to more people who are at risk of Huntington\u2019s Disease. If you decide to help us in our research, your data will be anonymised and analysed in aggregate form.

"writing this because i feel like i need to get it off my chest. \n\nmy mom has HD, she\u2019s about to turn 40 this month. i (19) have not been tested and do not plan to until i feel like i am mentally stable enough to handle a positive result. \n\nmy mom has gotten a lot worse over the last 4/5 years. it started with her having some behavioural issues, then she stopped taking care of herself and her apartment and she developed an alcohol problem, from there it just continued to get worse. she\u2019s at the point where she can\u2019t manage her finances or live independently, and she has terrible decision making skills. it feels like i\u2019ve completely lost the woman who raised me, someone who i used to idolize and who was my entire world (my dad wasn\u2019t really around). i\u2019ve been grieving because i lost that version of her, and i\u2019m not able to appreciate that she is still alive and here, i\u2019m not able to love her or think of her in the same way i used to. and that upsets me because i know i\u2019ll regret it one day when she really isn\u2019t here. i have no siblings, and no cousins from my moms side, sometimes i just feel so alone. \n\ni have mostly come to terms with my moms situation, but something that has been bothering me more and more is the thought of what my future might look like. my mom said she thinks (so this might not be totally accurate) she has 48 or 49 repeats. i just keep thinking that if i am positive for HD i will only live to be like 45 (if i\u2019m lucky), meaning i\u2019ve basically lived half my life already, when it feels like i haven\u2019t even started my life out yet (i graduated HS late, currently failing my first year of uni). this is such a scary thought. humans already have such a small time to spend alive, and to think that i could have even less is so sad. another thing is that i think as if i already have been diagnosed positive, i don\u2019t even like to consider the possibility of being negative because i don\u2019t like getting my hopes up. i am going to get tested eventually because i\u2019d rather know for sure than just live like i already have it. \n\nalso, does anyone have any advice on how to stop feeling like the world owes me something? i feel so unlucky and \u201ccursed\u201d that i always downplay other people\u2019s struggles because i feel like i\u2019m going through more, i always have this outlook that i deserve everything to go my way because of my misfortune. i know this isn\u2019t how the world works and i hate that i think this way. \n\ncurrently dealing with mental health issues and other stressors from my crappy life, i\u2019ve never felt this low. any positive insight or words of advice would be greatly appreciated.",
