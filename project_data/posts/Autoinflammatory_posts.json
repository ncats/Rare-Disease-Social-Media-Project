I was excited to find this subreddit! Even though it seems underutilized, I realise that is the nature of rare diseases/disorders and I\u2019m already much encouraged by the posts I have read thus far. ;)\n\nMy oldest son is 27 years old. He has been suffering from a mysterious illness that started impacting him sometime within his first two years of college so I guess that would be categorized as \u201cadult onset\u201d. His symptoms are high fevers, general achiness, malaise, swollen lymph glands and a wicked raw and painful sore throat. This used to happen every few months but as he gets older, the flares are coming more frequently and significantly impacting his life. The flares last about a week. \n\nOver the years he has been misdiagnosed with a handful of maladies, including Lymes and Babieosa. He has been tested and retested for a multitude of potential illnesses to no avail. His labs generally look great. Finally, his most recent doctor had the good sense to refer him to NIH. I went with him the day they did all of his testing and his work ups. The NIH team took an insane amount of blood, took a complete history of his background (travels, etc) and family history, took CT scans of his throat and trunk. We spoke with the genetics team and they are going to do a complete DNA analysis on both of us since I gave them my blood, too. The initial infectious diseases team there also brought the fever team onto the case. \nMy son has his reports so I don\u2019t remember all of his lab work results but most of them were within normal limits. The major stand out was the c-reactive protein, which was 150.5. His sed rate was also abnormally high but I don\u2019t remember the exact number. \n\nThe conclusion for the day was not an official diagnosis as I had hoped for but, the team feels very strongly that he is suffering from an auto inflammatory disease of some kind. Many of the auto inflammatory diseases I\u2019ve researched thus far seem to either appear in childhood and/or are accompanied by rashes, neither of which applies to my son. They will continue to research and investigate his case while we wait for the DNA results to come back in approximately 9 months. The team gave him a prescription for 30 mg of prednisone and told my son to take that dose immediately upon onset of his next flare and then report back to them the results. \n\nThe doctors at NIH were wonderful, they told us they don\u2019t give up and even if it takes them years they will not stop helping my son to sort this out. I am very encouraged but, in the meantime, Mama can\u2019t just sit on her thumbs and wait. So far, in addition to this subreddit, I have found an Autoinflammatory Patient &amp; Family Day in Bethesda, MD that we plan to attend and joined a Facebook group for Autoinflammatory diseases but I would love any advice that anyone has to offer, any suggestions for further advocating alongside my son for his health, any other resources and information!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Autoinflammatory", "subreddit_id": "t5_f1eml", "subreddit_subscribers": 45, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Adult Son, Mystery Autoinflammatory Disease aka Where is Dr. Gregory House When You Need Him? \ud83d\ude02", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1560950667, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Autoinflammatory/comments/c227ws/adult_son_mystery_autoinflammatory_disease_aka/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "emsynapse", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_s6q7b", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1558720799, "domain": "self.Autoinflammatory", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Autoinflammatory/comments/bsk2kb/monthly_check_in_how_is_everyone_doing/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bsk2kb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Autoinflammatory/comments/bsk2kb/monthly_check_in_how_is_everyone_doing/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1558720801, "score": 3, "selftext": "So I locked myself out of my mod account and have been slacking, I'm sorry for that.

For background I'm now 27, female, living in NY and I was only recently officially diagnosed with PFAPA in April 2021. I've been on Colchicine 1.2mg  daily and my flares have decreased significantly.\n\nThe start of it all is iffy to me but basically around 2008 (13-14 YO) I somehow got epstein-barr virus, was super dehydrated, vitamin d defficient and suddenly started to get tonsillitis every month. It was like clockwork, every 3 to 4 weeks I had infected tonsils, sore throat, high fever (102F +) for days at a time. After months of my pediatrician giving me amoxicillin or azithromycin, he finally referred my parents to an ENT specialist who immediately suggested a tonsillectomy, which we did. \n\nFor approx. 4-6 months following the tonsils removal I was still getting sick, my ENT couldn't quite figure it out and just prescribed azithromycin and chlorhexidine gluconate (the blue oral rinse ). We did this for YEARS. Some years I had only 2-4 flares, some years I had monthly flares. Then they started to coincide with my period. I missed out on many school days, events, work days as I accepted that this was just my fate. Until in my mid 20s when I finally decided enough was enough and began to ask questions and do research on my own. \n\nI asked my ENT what he thought was wrong with me and why we keep doing the same things over and over, in passing he said something like \"Well. It could be PFAPA but I really don't know because you don't present all the symptoms and you're just too old for it. \"  Because he sounded so dismissive of the idea, I was too. He didn't go into it and I didn't ask. Fast forward,  my curiosity led me to research more on this PFAPA I had never heard of.  I found out a rheumatologist could help me here. I found the best one I could, made an appointment and she ran many, many tests . I mean lots of bloodwork was done within that first day. \n\nConclusion? My rheumatologist was also skeptical to call it PFAPA because 1.) I was much older than the typical age bracket \\[it usually presents symptoms in early adolescence and fizzes out by the end of teen years. But I STARTED in my teen years and am almost 30 --- a very rare case\\]. And 2.) I also didn't experience ulcers/mouth sores.  But through bloodwork and extensive inventory of every single symptom, and by treating one of my flares with prednisone for the first three days and then putting me on a low dose of colchicine to start, they did eventually diagnose me with PFAPA. The prednisone and colchicine doses were fiddled with once or twice as we experimented with my reactions, tolerances, and depending on the degree of sickness until we found what worked.\n\nI'm putting this out there because if you needed a sign to look deeper into your health issues and you feel the need to find another doctor, you should do that. Trust your gut and listen to your body, if you think there's something wrong then go ahead and pursue that and find a practitioner who will listen to you. There's so much comfort in putting a name on the group of symptoms because it's a start and brings a sense of relief because now you know where you need to start focusing to heal or at least get back to a semblance of normal life. I will also add, there is something to be said about the role of stress and eating on the body and how it can affect the expression of your illness. It has been my experience that in high stess- no rest moments, I would be the sickest. I've been slowly working towards adding meditation, digital detox days, and anti-inflammatory foods to my life and it's been a   \n big part of getting myself back on track.\n\nHope this helps someone.

Each with little effect or its effect diminishing after some time. And prednisolone is something I decided I did not want to use due to its side effects. I'm currently using Etanercept which has had the most noticeably effect. Since using it my flares has significantly lowered in intensity and now lasts around 2-3 days. However, I now experience more flares, at about a week apart, which is a bit of a weird trade-off. Has anyone else experienced something similar? I started taking 50mg once a week.

Besides medication I am concious of what I eat, exercise regularly and try to get enough sleep.   \n   \nI have also been dealing with chronic daily headaches from around the same time I first started experiencing my flares.

I\u2019ve been dealing with it since I was infected and became very ill back in May of this year. I was so sick with Mono in the first few weeks to the point my throat was closing up because of my swollen tonsils. During this early time of my mono illness, I fell down my staircase at home and had a seizure and btw I have no history of seizures. I believe I had a grand mal seizure aka Tonic-clonic seizure because I experienced all of the symptoms of one. \n\nSo since then I got checked out with a neurologist and they did all of the testings for seizures including an EEG and brain MRI and everything came back normal and I do not have epilepsy. Fast-forward to October I\u2019ve been having some symptoms associated with an autoimmune disease. Some of these symptoms I\u2019ve been experiencing for a while like the hair loss for example but these other symptoms and issues are new. I\u2019ve been experiencing joint pain in different parts of my body. The joint pain has been primarily in my hands and arms. I\u2019ve also been having swelling of my feet. I\u2019ve been experiencing extreme fatigue and extreme tiredness. \n\nI\u2019ve been having sores on my scalp and head that are often itchy and sting. I\u2019ve been having blood circulation issues in my hands and arms. I\u2019ve been experiencing many skin related problems red round spots and pimple-like things that appear in different areas sometimes it reappears in the same location and it goes away after a few days but it leaves a mark where it was. I\u2019ve also been having some gastrointestinal problems as well. I should also mention that I sometimes experience auditory hallucinations. I have muscle tremors in different areas of my body but mainly in my legs. I also get Tingling or prickling, \u201cpins-and-needles\u201d sensation in my feet hands and fingers sometimes. I also have noticeable swelling in my hands and fingers. \n\nCold winter weather and temperatures tend to always make my problems worse and more intense. \n\nJust recently I went outside for not that long I was in the direct sunlight and I went back inside and not long after I quickly developed a red patchy rash on the top of both of my hands. These red rashes on my hands are a bit itchy, they burn and also sting. This red rash on my hands is predominantly on and around my knuckles. \n\nI was tested for rheumatoid arthritis and it came back negative but I had a positive ANA test. I am currently waiting for a referral approval from my health insurance to see a rheumatologist. \n\nI should mention I do have a family history of autoimmune disease. My mom has Crohn\u2019s disease, my sister has Celiac disease, my uncle was recently diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis, my grandfather has severe Rheumatoid Arthritis that ended his career in the Army and one of his sisters had Lupus when she was alive. Also, I should mention that everyone in my immediate family has Hemochromatosis including me, my mom, dad, sister, and brother.\n\nThe joint pain has been getting worse and becoming a lot more frequent and it travels throughout different parts of my body at the same time. For example, when I\u2019m having the joint pain it could be in one leg or foot and also in my thumb or something like that all at the same time and it can move around quickly. \n\nI was just recently tested for all the GI conditions and they came back negative. I also just had a colonoscopy and endoscopy and they did not find anything either.\n\nI have and still am being seen and treated by my dermatologist for my eczema, dermatitis.\n\nLet me know what any of you might think about this. I\u2019ve never been tested for an autoimmune disease before and never been diagnosed either. \n\nOver time it seems to me that all of these symptoms, issues and problems have been getting worse. \n\nThis is just a small list of my current symptoms and issues I\u2019m facing much more but it will be too much to list all here. \n\n[\u2018Mono\u2019 Virus Linked to Seven Serious Diseases](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/news/release/2018/mono-virus)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Autoinflammatory", "subreddit_id": "t5_f1eml", "subreddit_subscribers": 72, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I think I might possibly have some sort of autoimmune disease.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Autoinflammatory/comments/e7lbrm/i_think_i_might_possibly_have_some_sort_of/"}, {"author": "emsynapse", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1517000296, "domain": "self.Autoinflammatory", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Autoinflammatory/comments/7t7m6s/did_a_thing_and_started_a_subreddit/", "id": "7t7m6s", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Autoinflammatory/comments/7t7m6s/did_a_thing_and_started_a_subreddit/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1517065514, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Long-time redditor and autoinflammatory disease patient here.
