Clearly the L4/5 pressing on stenosis area is causing the compression and messing with my left leg/foot.\nMy spine man is going to do me a caudal epidural (not holding out much hope for that) but I\u2019m living in fear of cauda equina. \nAll I can do is lie down on my side. Sitting is too painful so I can\u2019t get any work done. I\u2019m also shielding. My bum is tingly and a bit numb- saddle area seems okay. Lower back feels like it\u2019s been hit by a bus. \nI\u2019d love to know your thoughts. Should I be worried? Should I insist on an operation to remove the disc away from the stenosis- it would probably be very risky at my current weight. \nThanks in advance.\nP.S have lost 3 stone so far.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_11vavm", "subreddit_subscribers": 103, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How worried should I be?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/iur8oy/how_worried_should_i_be/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Sho-Nufffff", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7sft58bf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1598427734, "domain": "self.CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/igumig/really_stressed_and_confused_need_advice_sorry/", "gildings": {}, "id": "igumig", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/igumig/really_stressed_and_confused_need_advice_sorry/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1598427744, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019ve been really struggling for the past three months since this all started. I had back surgery (l5 s1) about six years ago. Reinjured my back this June just doing too much at once. Initially I had an appointment with my prior surgeon just to check in as I had back pain For about a week or so and had an aching feeling in my leg. But the weekend before my appointment, I was sitting down and realized I had completely emptied my bladder without knowing. Because I had always heard this could constitute an emergency, I rushed to The ER and they scanned me in the MRI- I was fully expecting needing emergency surgery but to my surprise they said I only had a small disc protrusion at the l5 s1 and not compressing my cauda equina nerves.\n\nI was relieved but then later that week started having saddle area numbness. I continued to have random urinate leakage but nothing like the first incident. I was scared of course and actually headed back to the ER and again they did a lumbar scan and said nothing had changed. My surgeon reviewed these scans and agreed no surgery was needed.\n\nOver the past three months I continue to have urinary leakage, frequency, need to get up at night to urinate, increased leg pain, intermittent saddle numbness, and am very afraid. I\u2019m 37 and was very active before this and also have to take care of a four year old by myself. It got very stressful for me and I finally took a medical leave from work last month. I also feel like my balance is off. \n\nI\u2019ve now had four lumbar scans, a sacral exam, thoracic, cervical, and brain. I\u2019ve gone to two neurosurgeons, an orthopedic surgeon, three neurologists, had EMG and NCV done- and nobody has recommended surgery. I had a urological work up which found an overactive detrusor which \u201cseems odd in a 37 year old \u201c ie the doctor told me it\u2019s likely neurological issues with my spine. But she\u2019s a urologist - not a spine doctor. \n\nI went to the ER last night because my leg pain has been getting worse. Again, a lumbar scan and told it\u2019s just a small l5 s1 protrusion touching my s1 nerve but no compression. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do because now I am told just to treat the symptoms. I\u2019m depressed, anxious, in pain, and struggling. By all my research these symptoms are of CeS and I can\u2019t find any other explanation. I don\u2019t want to get worse and worse and I fear that I am. They want to give me an epidural shot but given my symptoms I\u2019m just shocked. \n\nAnybody run into this situation? The doctors don\u2019t call my scans normal but have said I do not have CeS,  yet can\u2019t explain my symptoms. I live in Los Angeles and am seeing some of the best hospitals and doctors to my knowledge. Do I trust them or do I keep fighting for my health? I feel like I\u2019m taking crazy pills and it\u2019s making me feel subhuman. I really don\u2019t think I can take this torture for more weeks on end. \n\nReally sorry for long rant but I cry multiple times a day and have sunk into deep depression over this.

I'm kind of desperate for answers so I'm giving this subreddit a shot.\n\nI had a gradual onset of cauda equina syndrome over 5 years. I went to the ER in March due to a worsening of symptoms and was diagnosed with CES. My L1-L2 disc had prolapsed (some time ago, actually) was treated with a microdiscectomy. In the process of diagnosis, I also had a lumbar puncture, during which my opening pressure was low.\n\nAfter that surgery I first improved, and then slowly got much worse. I had severe pain in my low back and right leg, and violent muscle spasms that eventually progressed to span my entire trunk from the L1 level down and right leg down to the knee. I was also having terrible headaches and instances where I thought I might black out, which I attributed to the way my body deals with severe pain. I returned to the neurosurgeon who treated me for CES, who said the problem was lumbar spinal stenosis. I scheduled a L1-S1 laminectomy and had that surgery at the end of June.\n\nDuring that surgery, the neurosurgeon found an arachnoid diverticulum with a small CSF leak and repaired it. It was at L4, where a lumbar puncture is typically performed. The neurosurgeon proposed that it developed in part due to the low pressure. The stabbing pain in my back is gone, but I still have very severe (albeit more localized) spasms. \n\nThe right side of my low back and right hip were in terrible spasm after surgery. I was put on dexamethasone for general inflammation which alleviated the spasms. Once I tapered off, the spasms returned full force. I've done several short courses of steroids now and the spasms return every time. I also have fasciculations in my right leg from my hip to my knee. I saw the surgeon again today. He gave me a two week course of dexamethasone and diazepam, so these symptoms are controlled for two weeks at least.\n\nI've had spasticity for years and these spasms feel like spasticity, or at least some version of hypertonia. Those muscles are always far too tight, but they don't spasm as long as I'm on a low/medium dose of steroids. 24mg methylprednisolone or 4mg dexamethasone daily seems to be the minimum dose that prevents spasm. These spasms are violent to the point that walking only a short distance is excruciating. I am taking 20mg of baclofen TID, btw. I have for years. That prevents the spasticity in my legs as always but does nothing for the new and more intense spasms I'm experiencing.\n\nMy neurosurgeon says he hasn't seen this before. He's stumped and reaching out to colleagues for ideas. Anyone here have any idea what could be wrong? I'm glad steroids are controlling it but that's a terrible long term solution. Without them I effectively can't walk and I'm quite concerned. I need to get back to my life at some point, ideally sooner rather than later. Thanks in advance for any input!\n\nBtw, MS has been ruled out a number of times, including in March. It's not MS. Is this from CES? Does anyone else have lingering or intense spasticity?\n\nCross posted to r/askdoctors.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_11vavm", "subreddit_subscribers": 88, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spasticity?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/hqrc8h/spasticity/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Shadowfaxlkj", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5hbjebxs", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594064129, "domain": "self.CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/hmerxm/can_this_be_ces/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hmerxm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/hmerxm/can_this_be_ces/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1594067718, "score": 1, "selftext": "3 years ago while lifting some stuff I suffered L5-S1 slip disc.

Last Wednesday (5/27) I had a diagnostic procedure done (facet joint injection block) because I have been in insane pain for a little over 2 years now. I was so excited because when the procedure was done (and lidocain was in my system, blocking the pain) I felt pretty good. I went home Wednesday afternoon and woke up around 1am on Thursday morning, feeling like I had just been hit by a bus. \n\nMy dad has degenerative disc disease and has had many surgeries and procedures done, so he said to just take my medicine and lay back down because I was probably just sore from the procedure. It was normal. I also knew that the pain relief would only be temporary, so I thought nothing more of it. Thursday afternoon when I woke up again, I couldn't straighten myself up. I don't know how else to describe it but, I was walking like a granny and in a LOT more pain than I had been in ever before. I ate, stayed in bed, and just tried to rest. \n\nFriday around 2am, I tried to move in bed and I felt the worst pain in my entire life. Both of my legs felt like they were being ripped off and my back was literally *throbbing.* I tried to move again to get into a more comfortable position, but I ended up getting stuck with half of my body on the bed and half off. I couldn't move, nobody was awake and I just tried to do everything myself. It took an hour and a half of me sitting like a slash / on my bed before I heard my brother get up and I had him help me sit up. Once I got right, I had to go to the bathroom. I tried to get up, but I couldn't get my legs to move. It wasn't that I lost feeling, they just felt like I had iron weights on my feet. \n\nAfter being helped into the bathroom, sitting on the toilet was agony and I realized that I hadn't urinated or anything since Wednesday night, and it's Friday morning at this point. When my mom and dad got up they took me to the emergency room and sadly they could not go with me. It was hours of doctors looking at my back and after a CT scan (with and without contrast) they said they were sending me to a bigger hospital in the city (I live in a rural town in Kentucky with very limited resources). I was taken there to the emergency department (SUCH NICE ROOMS!) and stayed there while I was looked at more.\n\nI had a catheter for the first time in my life, and if I can ever help that it will *never* happen again. They did an MRI, again with and without contrast, and then I spoke to a neurosurgeon. I have CES, he explained what it was and why I was feeling the way I was feeling and said that I'm going to have to have surgery. Sunday afternoon they sent me home with medicine and an appointment for June 15th to meet with the neurosurgeon again and plan my surgery.\n\nI'm honestly just-- I'm scared. My dad had back surgery and it ruined his life because the surgeon came in drunk and operated on him. My granny had surgery and for months she couldn't walk. So I guess here are some questions I have:\n\n1. Have you had surgery to fix any issues related to CES?\n2. If you had surgery, what was it like? What was the recovery like? How is your pain now?\n3.

I got an CT that showed the protrusion in october and a steroid shot that dulled the pain for a while. Around christmas i started to notice paresthesia in both my feet and ever so slightly around my genitals. I got a second steroid infiltration and an mri which confirmed compression of the sciatic nerve.\n\nThe second shot helped immensely, the leg pain is completely gone most of the time. Sometimes a dull feeling appears when i am sitting, but it is rare and not very intense. However, a month ago I was in the bathroom before going to bed and I seemingly felt something pop and instantly both legs started tingling a lot more than before. After a week tingling around my buttocks and genitals appeared so I went to the ER. Immediately an MRI was taken, but it showed no compression of the sacral nerves and it has become slightly smaller than on the MRI in january, according to the doctors, so they decided not to operate. \n\nSince then (3 weeks ago) the tingling in my legs subsided a little, but there has been no improvement in my saddle region. On the contrary, a week later I got the sensation that something was stuck between my butt cheeks, so to speak, or a numb feeling. It does feel mostly normal when I touch it though, or maybe slightly numb, but that is difficult to say since i can't really compare. I mailed my neurosurgeon but as long as it is not saddle anesthesia, he does not see it as an indication to perform surgery (since I am only 27 they want to avoid surgery if possible). But this has not improved since then and I have the feeling that it is getting worse very slowly. But I do worry a lot and I have had people suggest that i make it worse by worrying so much (i can't help it, i am very stressed about this progressing to CES at the moment).

I searched around a bit and found out that an extension of the sciatic nerve, which goes down through your whole leg thus the sciatica, called the peroneal nerve passed through there. But in the electromyography (EMG) it showed that it wasn't diseased and it was in the normal range of functionality. However the caveat is that whilst the nerve might be fine and dandy these are the extensions of the nerves that are connected with the nerves that are being compressed along with the SC...

I was doing a lot of exercise. Went to a doctor and he basically ignored me and said not to worry about it unless I am incontinent. Like the stupid person I am I kept overexercising. I do have  a history of hypochondria which maybe causes doctors to ignore rare red flags.\n\nA year later went to a different doctor and my symptoms progressed a bit and I told him it seemd I had a numb saddle region, he said there was nothing he could do but come  back if I have more questions. \n\nMonths later I came back and finally got a lumbar MRI, a neurologist appointment, and a referal to an urologist who refuses my insurance. I think at this point I had bilateral leg pain worsened by walking, no urge/sensation to pee except at night, nsfw &gt;!a penis numb to light touch!&lt; .\n\nSo, on the lumbar MRI was minimal spondylolisthesis which the neurologist said wasn't causing my symptoms. Even though I read later laying down MRIs can underestimate spondylolisthesis slippage but a neurologist should taken that into account surely, right? But the neurologist appointment was weird he asked me to remember three words and left the room and came back, what did that have anything to do with my symptoms. And when I mentioned the NSFW numbness, he said not his job, but the urologist job. He did order a neck MRI though causs I had tingling fingers too. Insurance refused it.\n\nSo, I was frustrated I am terrible at talking with people even if they are listening well to me, so I stopped seeing doctors for s long time.\n\nAround a year later I see my doctor again and got a referal to a different urologist. Urologist thinks it has nothing to do with my exercising. Urologist says he doesn't know what is wrong and will run nerve tests in my NSFW regions in a few weeks.\n\nI think it maybe too late. My symptoms now include bilateral leg when walking, no urge/sensation to pee, nsfw &gt;!penis numb to light touch, soft erections, and even though I can ejaculate no orgasms!&lt; I an afraid some of my symptoms are permanent if my problems are permanent.  I don't  understand why none of the medical professionals I seen did order an emergency battery of tests for my symptoms. \n\nI know other people have it much worse medically such as being paralyzed. But o am unemployed loser in his 30s who is probably autistic. I never even dated. NSFW &gt;!depresses the fuck out of me I may incapable if penetrative sex even if sm a woman wanted to fuck me.!&lt;\n\n\nI have a high tolerance of pain and find it difficult to explain my symptoms to doctors. My parents got upset be cause i said they have been gaslighting me I think because they assume only psychopaths gaslight. Examples of their gaslighting is that they say it is just health anxiety or I shouldn't bother seeing an urologist. Another example is my mum saying I won't be paralyzed cause that rare. My symptoms are already rare and the causes of my symptoms are by definition  rare. Maybe instead of gaslighting me of my parents helped me figure out how to communicate to doctors I could've gotten the help I should've years ago.\n\nIt is definitely not health anxiety, health anxiety doesn't cause my type of symptoms.  Even if psychosomatic it would be something far more serious like conversion disorder or functional neurological  disorder.\n\nI am not looking forward to living decades more NSFW &gt;!without the ability to orgasm. I find much of ordinary life torture even with not working. Not being able to release with orgasms depresse me. And even worse I am mentally hornier than ever.!&lt;\n\nI am superficially in good health, I still do my calisthenics and light weights workouts because I am an idiot. Weirdly enough my workouts don't seem to aggravate my symptoms but walking long distances causes leg pain. What is also annoying is I have no clue what is causing my symptoms. Is it the spondylolisthesis that the lying down MRI, may have underestimated, is ot my thoracic or cervical spine? Is it some weird disease or is it perhaps I am.just insane?\n\nWhat also bothers me if this is because of my exercising then it shows that trying to better myself is a huge mistake.\nSorry, I just needed to vent. I know there are people with way worse  symptoms who are happy but I am mentally weak.\n\nTdlr stupid idiot has CES red flags for years. Doctors haven't figured it out.

Due to the leg symptoms, bowel changes, and anal numnbess I went to the ER. They did a urine retention ultrasound which was fine and an abdominal xray (for stool impaction). He also did a rectal examination and there were no internal or external hemorrhoids he could see. They did not have an MRI there and the doctor said he had no reason to refer me because he did not suspect Cauda Equina and said this is nothing to worry about.

But it's more of a quiet and defeated panic. I had a spinal fusion roughly four months ago to try and deal with degenerative disc disease (after pretty much an entire year of dealing with nerve damage). Despite dealing with new numbness in my feet and other issues in the weeks following the procedure, I eventually saw undeniable improvement in my nerve function. I felt like I was out of the woods and just needed to worry about recovery. \n\nAnd then, about 3 weeks ago, I heard a loud pop in my back. It didn't cause any pain other than a temporary sting. I figured it was nothing. Then, days later...incontinence and low urine flow. I thought SURELY this was some sort of minor disruption and that my nerves would recover in no time. And now I'm here weeks later dealing with the same issues I had before the surgery.\n\nSymptoms\n\n- Pins and needles between inner thighs/genitals\n- Numbness in or around back passage or buttocks\n- Increasing difficulty when trying to urinate\n- Leaking urine\n- Not knowing when bladder is full or empty\n\nInitially, I had no issues with bowel movements, but after about a week, those stopped entirely. And when they did occur, they were horribly inadequate - as if my body just stopped digesting food properly. But more than anything, I'm concerned about my issues with urination. Aside from what I've said already, there are times when I'll feel a sharp pain in my penis that feels a lot like urine being forced out of my body (this feeling led to an involuntary urine leak on two occasions). But if I take the time to try and urinate, barely anything comes out. It FEELS like I have 40 oz trapped in me and I can't hold it anymore, yet I can barely get 4 oz out of me. Like the painful urge just disappears as soon as I try to deal with it.\n\nFrankly, I'm still unclear on what it takes to reach a diagnosis of CES. When I spoke with the surgeon about this, he left me with the impression that I would have to be unable to use my legs to have CES. Meanwhile, I appear to be losing control over urination, and I can walk just fine (with slight sciatica pain returning). But the thing is, in the rare moment where I can get a decent urine flow going, I will consciously stop myself to see if I'm still in control...and I can still do that. And even though it seems like I have diminished feeling, I do still feel things. \n\n**So what am I looking for? WHEN does this become an emergency? When I completely lose feeling? If I can't move my pelvic muscles at all? Do I technically already have it and it's just a matter of time before I fully lose feeling or control?** I'm at a loss on all of this.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_11vavm", "subreddit_subscribers": 257, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Dealing with possible early onset CES.

After they were fixed, I still had increased numbness months later in both feet. After exhaustive trial and error, I found a topical medicine I was using was causing the numbness: topical minoxidil and finasteride.\n\nSeveral weeks after quitting the topicals, the numbness and tingling is 70% resolved and I\u2019m gaining more function in my right foot. I believe the herniated discs in my neck were restricting new signals to my lower body and limiting my recovery from CES. I think they had likely been herniated for years.

I have been having off and on sciatica since July. The pain stays on my right side and seems typical - lower pack, down the leg, and through my hip. A couple of months ago, I started feeling slight urinary tract discomfort and thought I may have a UTI. I spoke to a doctor over the phone, was prescribed antibiotics, finished the regimen, and all seemed well. Those UTI symptoms started presenting again last week. I went to an in person clinic this time and was told absolutely no infection. The sharp/burning pain seems to be connected to my sciatica symptoms and is more noticeable when I lay down, sit up, really when I just change positions. I haven't noticed any numbness or incontinence at this point, but this unexplained pain is worrying. Has anyone here experienced something similar? I don't want to jump to CES unnecessarily and I do have an appointment with my GP scheduled for the end of the month, but I found this subreddit and figured it can't hurt to ask people who have experienced CES firsthand. I also have costochondritis (diagnosed in April) but I don't think that would necessarily correlate.

They called my new neurologist (which I had just seen about a month ago and had been monitoring me and had me get a new set of tests and pt before we went under the knife) she told me that we were going to have emergency surgery to decompress the spine. She told me the symptoms were consistent with cauda equina syndrome and I had made the right decision in going to the er that day. Now 4 weeks plus post op I\u2019ve had my ups and downs\u2026. The downs were the leg weakness and mental\u2026. Also my numbness is still a thing but it\u2019s getting better. The good news: my bladder after being on a catheter for 4 weeks had come back and I\u2019m monitoring the input and output. Also my bowel control has returned recently. The numbness is going away slowly which is to be expected but I can feel pins and needles on my toes. My crotch and butt are still numb but with things getting better my hope is good that they too will come back. I hope to not have to walk with a walker for too long \u2026 but I dodged a bullet\u2026.. I could have eventually been paralyzed\u2026.

I\u2019m trying not to go back to the ER because I went a bunch of times in a row a few years ago (before more weight gain, and a fall off a bike), and the last time they tested my anal tone and said it was fine, and I need a spine specialist, who put me on physical therapy. I think that while the PT works,I easily backslide because of my weight and my WFH desk job. I put my symptom log below; looking for general support and advice. Monday is so far away :(\n\nTests: Able to tip toe and also walk on heels.\n\nSymptoms:\n\nSpine: Pain centralized right above the vertebrae.\nRight leg: numbness of pinky, ring toes. On and off calf weakness. On and off big toe/inner leg muscle weakness. Pain/numbness (O/O) of right inner butt cheek\nLeft leg: Numbness of pinky toe. On and off calf weakness. On and off big toe/inner leg muscle weakness. Pain/numbness of left inner butt cheek (O/O)\nGroin: Pain in/around urethral sphincter, anal sphincter, vagina. Intense bone deep pain in the perineum.\n\nContinence: some pain from the sphincter while peeing.\n\nRelief: Putting my belly weight on a table relieves the spine pain. Lying face down and press ups. Walking a bit. Doc told me to take 12 ibuprofen a day and layer on omeprazole, gabpentin, and Tylenol, and to go to the ER if symptoms stop coming and going or if I can\u2019t pee or if I mess myself.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_11vavm", "subreddit_subscribers": 243, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Troubling symptoms, getting a consult on Monday", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/r3ju0s/troubling_symptoms_getting_a_consult_on_monday/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Sourfckrs98", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8eplutgl", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1637986276, "domain": "self.CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/r34zcz/im_worried/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r34zcz", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/r34zcz/im_worried/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1637986288, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a herniated disc at L5-S1 and I had a few things happen in a 48 hour time span which I went to the ER for. My pain level went through the roof , I lost complete bladder control but it only happened once, and then there was A LOT of blood in my urine. When I got to the back in the ER I told them what was happening. The Nurse asked me what I wanted to be seen for, she was rude. I said the blood in my urine worries me the most, it was a lot of blood. Well they did a cat scan and there was a stone in my left kidney that was cutting my kidney. When the doctor came in to tell me that I asked him about me losing bladder control and he said that was probably from the herniated disc and went to walk out. I asked him if I could get something for pain he turned around and said I will give you a little something but you need to talk to your back doctor if you need anything else. He prescribed me tramadol which didn't help. I called my back doctor first thing the next morning and let his nurse know what was happening and I told her I needed something for pain. 20 mins before they closed for a 4 day weekend she called and said she had the prescription ready, I live 45 minutes away. She said nothing about me losing bladder control. 2 days into this 4 day wait I'm in misery all I can do is lay here in pain and I'm totally dependent on others at this point. I want to go to the ER but I'm afraid they wont do anything again. I don't want to just here and chance becoming paralyzed from this. The pain will ease up for an hour here and there. As far as the pain medicine goes I have had 2 1 week prescriptions in the last 5 years, I don't like taking them but I do when I have no choice.

Over the past month i\u2019ve developed some urinary issues - mainly urge frequency. I don\u2019t have any incontinence, i\u2019ve never leaked on myself and I\u2019ve held it on a STRONG urge for about 3 hours recently.  For my bowels I still poop daily but it\u2019s only a small amount (I eat one big meal a day because i\u2019m in college). However, as an otherwise completely healthy 21 year old I shouldn\u2019t be having these issues so I went to the ER because I read about CES online. The ER sent me home with a urology referral because without saddle anesthesia or foot drop a new MRI wasn\u2019t warranted. Urology tests came back negative so no infection. \n\nToday I woke up with what may be saddle parasthesia. The best way to describe it is if you rubbed your thighs together for a while and it starts to burn. I don\u2019t have any pain in my butt, I can still clinch my rectum fine and i can still get a strong urine stream out. Still no foot drop. I have full sensation everywhere, just worried as to whether this is an emergency or not.\n\nI really hope this isn\u2019t CES because I want to wait until December for my surgery, i\u2019m getting my procedure done at a world class hospital and I feel like they won\u2019t butcher my spine.

I have been lifting for a few years.  \n  \nAnyways, I got back from this run and then went out with some friends. While in the car, I noticed my scrotum felt wet/cold on my left side and like a weird faint tingling on my back if thigh. I felt around to see if i pissed myself but I hadn't. Weird, and a little concerning, but hopefully it'd go away. The next day, I went for a slower run trying to take it easy. I got back and noticed the numbness around my thigh was still there, and seemed to go down to my calf. I started looking up CES and got very worried and had my dad drive me yo the hospital because I knew quick intervention was key.  \n  \nOn my way to the hospital, my back started hurting like crazy. We got in they ran full spine MRI, everything came back normal. Blood tests, normal. They sent me home and told me it should get better. I feel like stress definitely made it worse, and I couldn't really pinpoint the symptoms because I think the prednisone made it more of a full body thing for me, tingling everywhere and weird sensations.  \n  \nMy symptoms at this point are :  \n-less sensitivity back/inner thigh (both I thought at the time but maybe just the left)\n-numbness around anus (perineum seemed fine I think, scrotum also unaffected)\n-less urge to pee, weak stream\n-leg weakness\n-back pain\n-left side of penis numb  \n  \nFor the next 2 months I am back at college, everything seems to be getting better. I'm back in the gym and almost back to where I was at the beginning of summer and no pain, leg days seemed to help my symptoms.

It's also been tingling faintly starting yesterday. Only in my left side\n  \nAll of the sudden, yesterday I felt like I had diminished urge to pee. I woke up this morning with zero urge despite going and voiding maybe 100-200 ml. I feel like I'm retaining still, my penis is still half numb. My anus is numb occasionally, and recently I noticed that my anal sphincter is gaping when I spread my cheeks and look. Abnormal and I don't do anal or stick anything up there so very unusual, especially considering it was overly tight a few months ago. I have some ED, I don't get random erections and no morning wood.

I'm 29 years old and I have had back pain and sciatica on and off for a few years. Made sure to exercise and walk often and it always went away. Untill this summer.. I tried PT, went to a chiropractor, but nothing helped. Luckily I was taken seriously and had a MRI planned for September. But never made it so far. \n\nIn August I noticed that I couldn't really get a stream going on anymore. Went to the doctors but they didn't think of CES. Next day I lost sensations in my saddle area. I did not know this was the first red flag, was never told. Couple days later I lost the ability to stand on my toes. This was very alarming to me, still didn't know I should have gone to the ER. So next day I went back to the GP who did some tests on me. Even though they didn't suspect CES, my urinary problems got me send to the ER. After that it all went fast. Bladder echo, emergency MRI, and a few hours later I was in surgery to get rid of my massive herniated disc. \n\nEven though I was outside of the 24/48 hr adviced threshold, I did make a full recovery. It took about a month. 1 day post surgery my bladder function was back. Slowly my strength came back. And lastly the saddle area regained all sensory function. I do still have burning sensations but I expect with PT and light exercising to that my nerves will heal and calm down eventually. \n\nRecovery is harder than I thought and hoped though. Especially mentally. I'm still trying to process what happened and the feeling of my own body betraying me. The months of pain, despair and eventually the fear of losing my mobility and my independence. \n\nReading some of the stories here I am so thankful that I was listened to and that I was able to get surgery when I did.

On a hike (carrying roughly 80 pounds of gear) we stopped for a break after 6 miles and when throwing my pack over my back I felt a pop in my lower back. Was able to finish the last 3 miles we had with some pain on right side of my back. Didn\u2019t think much of it and continued to work out/train over the next couple of weeks and my pain began to worsen and began getting sciatica symptoms on my right side. (Pain in hip down to toes, down my butt, and shooting pains whenever I moved a certain way, tingling in toes and some loss sensation). Plus some urine leakage after peeing and sitting down. At this point pain level was a 7 so I went in to get it looked at. I was ordered an mri and 30 days rest and was instructed to go to ER if pain increased or symptoms increased. \n3 weeks later my mri results had returned and my pain began to decrease and there were no signs of incontinence. I was told nothing came back on mri and that it was probably a muscle strain. I believed the doctor and went on way to full duty but I did not continue to work out.\nI continued to have very mild symptoms until About a month  while going pick up my dog during a mandatory month quarantine at home I had what felt like a firecracker go off in lower back and all the severe symptoms came back with a vengeance. I was more or less bed ridden for 3 days and back and radicular pain with incontinence that included sudden urges, frequent urination and uncontrolled dribbling at random times and even noticed ED. This continued for the next two weeks. Well my pain subdued to it\u2019s usual 2-4 with very mild sciatic pain present  and decided to power on. \nFast forward 9 months of regular infantry work. My daily back pain has increased to 4-5 range and with flare ups around 7 usually related to strenuous activity. With flare ups incontinence issues would be present. \nAt this point I knew something was wrong so I requested MRI results and read that that I had a minimal diffuse disc bulge at l4-l5 and a posterior asymmetric Bulge more on right contacting the bilateral intrarenal recess s1 nerve sleeves. I was set to PCS just days later so I decided to go to doctor at new duty station. While on PCS leave i went to see a neurologist who performed an emg that was positive for l5-S1 nerve pressure. I was informed that an mri many times doesn\u2019t show pressure that inflammation can put on nerves when I\u2019m conjunction with a mild disc bulge. \nWell fast forward 2 more months and I see my provider who refers me to orthopedic clinic and to have more images done. In follow up with orthopedic I was told my disc bulge i had a central protrusion that Indents the thecal sac, however that these findings and back pain are \u201cnormal\u201d in the infantry and I could carry on at full duty status. They did refer me to a physical therapist and a pain management clinic. 6 weeks of physical therapy did not help and I had 2 epidural injections that also did not help. With physical therapy I had a reflare up of my incontinence that has been the worst it\u2019s been. Urgency and frequency is through the roof and on multiple occasions had to pee in a bottle In my car on short car rides and visibly peed a decent stream on myself while trying to run to bathroom In the mall and some ED again. Went to see provider again who referred me out to a urologist. After seeing urologist he said back pain was likely the cause of both ED and incontinence. He scheduled me with a follow up in 30 days and referred me back to orthopedics. \nOrtho pretty much had the same to say and declared that mri doesn\u2019t show that the urinary incontinence and ED was back related. \n\n\nMy daily pain is hovering around a 5 with frequent back flare ups into the 7 range,  with all sciatica pain, incontinence still occurring and seemingly getting worse. I worried if I have slow onset of Cauda Equina Syndrome or just nerve damage in general it could worsen. My  mental health is suffering as well from all this . I\u2019m just not what to do from here.

I should preface this by saying I work 8-10 hours a day at a desk, am in my late 20s, average but slightly slender build, 160lb weight and just under 6 ft tall. Summer of 2019 I went to a PT for some knee issues, I had never had any back issues leading up to this point but they weren\u2019t making progress on my knee pain I got from doing a lot of stupid things so they said oh maybe it\u2019s your back causing your knee pain. I assured them it wasn\u2019t as I knew how I hurt them but they insisted on having me do McKenzie push-ups. They pressed down on my lower back as I did these and I\u2019ve basically had lower back pain ever since. It started very mild and was on and off but stable until February of 2020 when I bought a new car and something about the seats didn\u2019t agree with whatever was going with my lower back because that purchase marked the beginning of a long slow decline in my neurological health. My symptoms almost immediately went from on and off mild pain, to moderate back pain (spiking to moderate/severe pain after 30mins in that particular car), bladder spasms, urgency, frequent urination, a feeling of heaviness in my feet, tightness in my calves, etc. Overtime some of these issues started out very bothersome and improved, others were mild at first and are now my chief complaints. Currently, what progressed to an almost complete inability to tell when I need to urinate (coming to a head in the last 3 weeks I would say) and heaviness in my feet with some reduced sensation which is most noticeable when driving, are the most bothersome symptoms. I am essentially going off a feeling of pressure in my abdomen to know when I need to urinate at this point. I do not have any issue initiating urination once I get to the toilet for whatever reason, I have not yet had any episodes of incontinence although it seems to be progressing to that inevitable point very slowly but surely. I also can feel when I am urinating and can stop and start the stream if I want. I have similar issues with not being able to tell when I need to have a bowel movement but this is either less problematic for me or that process has simply not been as severely damaged for whatever reason. My back pain is manageable and I can sit for 7-8 hours for work although I\u2019m sore by the end. If work a full day then go for a drive the reduced sensation in my feet is markedly worse than on a weekend when I\u2019m not sitting so much. I cannot drive for more than an hour at a time without my feet becoming too distant feeling to trust my input to the pedals and the low back pain also ramps up a bit usually. I cannot wear a belt, or wash a car without breaks due to all the bending over. I cannot wear most shoes as the shock seems to piss off my lower back, I cannot wear many jeans and elastic waisted shorts as the waist band is often not loose enough and causes my calves to start contracting and the back pain to ramp up if I wear them for more than 10 minutes. I have seen many GPs, 2 orthos, 2 neurologists and a neurosurgeon. I\u2019ve had an EMG, a full spine and brain MRI (w/o contrast), $7k worth of bloodwork ordered by the neurologists. All of these tests were completely clear, per the last full spine MRI I had a few months ago I have no disc herniations or even bulges. I have a couple tiny ones in my cervical spine that the neurologist was surprised the neurosurgeon even noticed as they were barely visible on the scan but all clear besides that. There\u2019s no stenosis, I don\u2019t have diabetes or any chronic condition. MS was all but ruled out, they said the only extra thing they could do was do another scan with contrast but that my symptoms overall didn\u2019t even match well with MS anyway. My personal opinion is that I have nerve compression in my lower back as a result of sitting all day. I used to work 14+ hours a day at a computer and stopped once my symptoms really started ramping up in early 2020. I believe either my severe anterior pelvic tilt and terrible posture and weak pelvic floor may be setting the stage for muscles and ligaments to be pulling my nerves there out of alignment or otherwise stretching them and damaging them, or the act of sitting in a chair so many hours caused enough direct compression of the nerves in the area of the cauda equina over time that that was about to damage them without a disc herniation being the culprit. No one seems to be taking this seriously and I have a strong feeling that will remain unchanged unless I become incontinent at which point my bathroom faculties will likely be too late to save. If this were presenting with a disc herniation it would be considered a medical emergency, but because that is absent no doctor I\u2019ve seen seems to care at all and they basically shrug their shoulders and tell me to go PT, for what I don\u2019t know considering PT was actually the catalyst for this whole mess. Any thoughts or ideas are extremely welcome as I have a feeling the next 1-2 months are going to be critical in saving what I have left for urinary continence.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_11vavm", "subreddit_subscribers": 205, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Any ideas?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/pd3dvt/any_ideas/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "fluorescent_hippo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_866gm81f", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1629952778, "domain": "self.CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/pbsd6v/so_like_does_anyone_make_a_full_recovery/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pbsd6v", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 27, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/pbsd6v/so_like_does_anyone_make_a_full_recovery/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1629952789, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm in ER right now almost positive it's what I got waiting for mri, and I'm so worried.

I'm wide awake in the middle of the night and pretty much panicking.\n\nBack in October 2020, my health took a sudden downturn. I had major bathroom issues and didn't know what could have possibly been wrong with me. My primary care doctor was able to get an MRI referral cleared, and at the end of the month, I had the scan done. I learned I have a dessicated disc at L5/S1. \n\nFrom there, I was referred to a neurologist to determine the next step, which was scheduled for the end of November. During this month, it was seriously impossible to sit down. Every time I did, I felt pain, which was especially bad during long trips to emergency rooms. Due to a miscommunication, this appointment had to be rescheduled...*for early January*. I waited. Got COVID-19. Had to reschdule again. And finally, I made it back at the end of January. I was sure I'd be told I needed a microdiscectomy, or at least physical therapy. He said straight away I'd need a spinal fusion.\n\nI don't want to be specific about my situation, but I can say I've had no insurance through all of this, so I've had to wait to see if my health care provider would cover the costs of the surgery. For reasons I can't fathom, it took until *June* to hear anything back about getting the surgery referral to the approval stage. And...about a week ago, I received a quick response informing me that the request was denied. It's been four months since the surgery was recommended, and it was quickly denied.\n\nanyway. I've been dealing with urinary hesitancy and retention since late May. It has complicated even bed rest and made me feel terrible. Near the middle of the month, I had an incident where a bowel movement made me feel sharp pain, and suddenly, it became easier to urinate. But this is hardly good news - when I say it was easier to urinate, I mean it was harder to control. I rushed to my healthcare provider thinking it was finally time for surgery...and they told me I was out of luck and I needed prednisone. This apparently wasn't a red flag, which seemed ridiculous. \n\nFrom there, I had slight improvement. But as of right now...it really feels like I'm losing control. Wben I feel the (distant) urge to urinate, I deal with it as soon as possible. and it always feels inadequate. I feel myself controlling the flow, but I feel like I would be unable to stop the flow. When done, I still feel an unavoidable urge to urinate. Most troubling, I have frequent urine leaks. Even passing gas seems to be enough to cause a slight leak. and truthfully, I think the only reason I haven't had an involuntary release is because I'm able to react to any urges to urinate as soon as I feel them.\n\nI should say I now have insurance and I'm thinking about going to a different health care provider...but I just don't know. I feel like I'm dangerous territory, but that medical professionals won't acknowledge it. And I realize no one here would be able to say definitively that I'm in trouble. So I guess I'll leave with this - WHEN am I going to be in trouble? I want to do what I must to avoid permanent nerve damage, but no one is listening to me.

Well, lots earlier than that, off and on, but this was a bit that wasn't going away. I tried to grit my teeth and bear through it, but it got to the point where I couldn't sit, walk, and went to lay out on the bed for three or four days. Thankfully, was able to work remotely at the time, so my wife brought me my laptop, and I was just doing the work thing.\n\nIt was a Sunday, as I was the weekend coverage person for tech support. I remember laying on my belly in bed, typing away...when suddenly I realized that my back didn't hurt at all. Like NOTHING. I'd had constant pain for maybe a month, so I was excited. I carefully got up to go get my wife, plopped my feet on the floor, and then promptly fell over. Wife heard, and come and got me. I'd lost all the feeling from my knees to my hips. Checking, everything from my knees to my belly button was just gone. I could stand and walk, but it was like a baby deer, I couldn't balance. \n\nMy wife insisted we go to the emergency room. I wanted to wait it out and see if I got better. God bless my wife, she won. She went to get ready, and I went to the bathroom out of habit because I didn't know when I'd need to go, and that's where you put on the deodorant and brush your teeth. It turns out I did need to go, even though I didn't think so. The scariest part of this whole experience was trying to clean myself after the bathroom, because I couldn't feel my butt, at all. \n\nWife got me in the car with help from my kids, we got to the ER, they dropped me out in front so they could park. The ER folks knew I was having trouble standing up, and gave me a wheel chair. \n\nThey took me in on a Sunday...minimal staffing. They asked me my symptoms, and I told them I felt GREAT as far as my back went, but I was numb. They offered me pain meds, and I declined. They had to call the on call MRI person (which is rarely done on Sundays), who came in and gave me an MRI. When the results came back, they paged the whole surgical crew before they even discussed it with me. I got told I needed surgery RIGHT NOW and every second counted. Then they took 20 minutes making me and my wife sign things. \n\nI was in surgery inside 2 hours of hitting the ER. It was the first time I'd ever been in surgery. They made me sign lots of papers saying 'hey you might die'. It was kind of scary. \n\nZonked out, woke up, huzzah, they say success, and I can feel all my dangly bits. \n\nON A SUNDAY. Every one of them was on call, none in the office. They were all there inside an hour. \n\nI got out with some nerve damage in my left leg. I have to be careful on stairs, or \"lol\" trying to run or something. The left leg has never been the same. I get inappropriate pain, and inappropriate sensations from my nerve endings there, sometimes the nerves in my leg freak out so bad it makes me cry out in pain. but overall, the on call crew that day saved me due to their prompt actions on 'on call' day. \n\nI got SO lucky.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_11vavm", "subreddit_subscribers": 170, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My CES experience.

It\u2019s been like this for months and I\u2019m afraid sensation won\u2019t come back even after surgery. Does anyone know or been through this? Are those nerves dead and not coming back?

Fit and active weight lifter for most of my life.\n\nI started working at a warehouse in March 2019. Between that time and December 2019, I estimate that I lifted likely 75,000 30-pound packages of drinks in that 9 months. Some packages had to go as high as around the 7ft mark above my head and onto a shelf  and others down to an empty pallet on the floor. December 2019, I started having autonomic dysfunction symptoms (\"Dysautonomia\") that no doctor or specialist could find a disease or condition to attribute it to. Rapid fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate by the second, shortness of breath, shakiness, trembling, adrenaline flushes, etc. Intermittent stomach pain, bladder pain, colon pain and lumbar pain. I've had them on and off ever since. \n\nIn November 2020, I hurt my back at work. Something happened while working. Stabbing lumbar pains that feel like a nerve is being crushed between vertebrae when I bend forward, backward, left or right. Trouble standing up straight and too much pain to stand up straight and walk at the same time most of the time. They sent me to a worker's comp panel doc. Nearly 2 months of physical therapy. Non-contrast lumbar MRI ordered after over a month. When the physical therapy failed to work, she discharged me saying there was nothing she could do for me. She sent a letter to my employer stating that my autonomic symptoms are the cause of my back pain. My personal doctor wrote a letter refuting the worker's comp doctor. He said that they needed to treat my back injury separately because simple autonomic issues do not cause back injuries or interfere with them healing. In the letter, it said to see my neurologist for treatment. I had seen him before and he looked at the MRI disc and documented Sciatica. At that time (late January or early February), I had it in just the right leg running down to the foot. Now it's in both legs even when just standing. When I told the worker's comp doc in person that he said that, she brushed it off. \n\nIt is now months later. I got a worker's comp lawyer in February. After discharging me with ongoing 10 pounds and under lifting restrictions and limited bending (which she played off in the letter to my employer was because of my autonomic symptoms for them to accommodate them), she also noted in her doctor's notes that I failed to attend pain management. I was never recommended to go at all. No documentation, no referral and she cut my benefits shortly after due to the letter to my employer. I had no idea that she wrote that in her notes until my attorney found out from the opposing counsel. Insurance adjuster wrote in email that I had the right to see a new treating doctor and then declined it 10 days later by controverting the case after I had picked another doctor. They haven't paid a dime of worker's comp. Employer claimed indemnity. Insurance company claimed only partial responsibility. Now I'm lightheaded 24/7, walk with an odd stagger-like wide stance gait, I'm a bit off-balance, still have stabbing/pinching lumbar pain and having trouble walking and standing up straight at the same time. My bladder and bowels have  been increasingly malfunctioning over time with 24/7 pain and discomfort in bowels, bladder and stomach. All 3 hurt at the same time. My bladder and colon hurt so bad some nights that it feels like I'm dying. Bladder and bowel malfunctions. Sometimes 3-4 days between a bowel movement and then soft stool all at once, indicating that it wasn't constipation due to hard stool. The intestines simply aren't functioning properly. It feels like the pain is radiating from my lumbar through the middle of my body and into my colon/bladder and stomach. I told the worker's comp doc in person at a visit months ago and she said, \"That's because the nerves go around to the front.\"\n\nI can't stand or walk over 5-10 minutes without my legs feeling like they're burning, tingling, muscles not working properly and sometimes certain odd feelings of numbness on the outside side of my legs. I have to sit down to urinate because it takes a number of tries. I'm still not sure if it empties completely. When I go to sit down on the toilet, I usually spray myself with urine because I can't hold it while sitting down. I can generally hold stool and urine for a certain amount of time, but it's a much stronger urge and hits with little warning. As soon as I sit on the toilet, my ears both start ringing and my heart starts pounding. After urinating, I will sometimes get very heavy aches in my bladder like the bladder itself feels extremely tired/fatigued. Burning bowel pain for hours after a bowel movement. Sometimes I feel really rough contractions in my intestines. Diarrhea on certain days with little ability to hold it for long. Leg weakness when walking...it just feels like I can't control my legs as well.\n\nI have an upcoming spine doctor appointment days from now. Could I have CES of a progressive form?  Given my symptoms, would nerve damage have already started occurring? Would it be permanent or salvageable? I know that's technically hard to answer at this point.\n\n[https://flickr.com/photos/jmr1068204/albums/72157719130154021](https://flickr.com/photos/jmr1068204/albums/72157719130154021)  This album has 40 of the most clear images from my MRI.\n\nMRI translation: \"Mild-to-moderate degenerative spondylosis at L4-5 associated with Scheuermann's disease.

In addition there is a left lateral and left foraminal herniated disc protrusion and bone spur measuring 3 x 6mm in size touching the epidural space with minimal extension into the left neural foramen.

Waiting is my biggest regret. I should have sought help months before I did and I might not be where I am today if I had. \n\n2) This is going to be somewhat graphic. I will try to use humor as I\u2019d rather laugh about it now as I have shed far to many tears over this damned thing. \n\n3) This bitch is long and there is no way a TLDR is going to do it justice. I\u2019m writing this just as much for me as for anyone else who may be interested in reading my story as I have enjoyed reading others, so strap in. \n\n\nIn October of 2020 I sought the care of an orthopedic about a change in sensation in my leg. I had noticed and ignored weakness and tingling below my knee for what had to have been a month or two but didn\u2019t think to go to a doctor until I began noticing that I couldn\u2019t feel my leg below my right knee. The ortho evaluated me and ordered an MRI. My MRI showed  herniations between L3L4 and L4L5. The L3 herniation was the only one that was of concern to him and scheduled a steroid injection. He felt confident that due to my age (22M) there was a good chance 1 to 2 injections could clear this up, although I would need to loose weight to better my odds (I am obese however happy to report that is rapidly changing since surgery, something I should have done years ago) \nAs he leaves he tells me what I\u2019m sure he does every lumbar patient \u201cIf at any point you loose bladder or bowel control go to the ER immediately\u201d. \n\nIn the next month I would notice myself deteriorating. I work in warehouses and my role had me walking the floor all day, something I could have done and did with ease 6 months prior despite my size but was getting harder day by day. My leg would start shaking and occasionally give out. Thankfully I am relatively alone as I work in inventory and so no one was there to see. I felt ashamed of myself, like I was just being weak or a bitch and so powered through. It got so bad I had to push around a cart for support, stopping frequently due to pain. I had to make excuses to have others lift things for me which slowed my productivity. I thought all would be fine after my injection. \n\nIt is now the begging of December, I took the week off of work for my injection. By this point driving was my worst nightmare. I had to constantly check my foot to make sure it was on the correct pedal and more than once I hit the brakes when I meant to hit the gas or vice versa. To this day I don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t kill myself or someone else in an accident, but am forever thankful I didn\u2019t. I had family drive across the country to take me to the injection and just help me in the following days. I felt some relief but it faded, but against my better judgment I sent my mother home. \n\nThe next week, on Friday December 11th I step out of the shower and walk to my laundry room to get clothes out of the dryer to begin getting ready for work. As I am carrying the basket of laundry through my house I feel an awful sensation in my back and my bowel evacuates on the bathroom floor and I collapse. No warning, no change in sensation, just shit. My only reaction was to begin scream crying. I knew exactly what happened, why, and what it meant. I call my parents as in that moment I didn\u2019t know what else to do. They are in the car and on their way before I\u2019m done explaining what just happened. Next I call my doctor to find out what hospital I can go to that my Orthopedic can operate on me as I knew I would want someone familiar with my case to handle my care. I call a family friend to take me to the hospital as while it was an emergency I didn\u2019t think an Ambulance was necessary, and began cleaning. I got myself back into the shower and washed off, managed to get the bath rug which had caught everything in a trash bag and packed a bag to go the hospital. And wept. In that moment I knew the coarse of my life what changed although I didn\u2019t know to the extent. \n\nThe family friend arrives and the first thing he does is hand me adult diapers to put on. The first of many embarrassments I would experience but certainly not the last, although I admired them thinking on their feet and get a good laugh about it now when I think about it. We talk and they calm me down as I was just about having a panic attack and we head to the ER. Upon arriving I am told I will have to go back by myself but that due to the pandemic there are no rooms available and so it\u2019s a cot in the hallway for me. By this point it is 8AM. I have not eaten since 6 the previous night. I would not be seen until 4 PM when a doctor came by, brought me into the trauma room as it was the only private area and proceeded to check my groin, legs and anus. I hadn\u2019t realized it until then but I couldn\u2019t feel my groin, I couldn\u2019t feel his thumb in my rear and my left leg had gone numb too. I still had motor control of my legs but I was walking like a drunk giraffe. He concludes what I feared, Cauda Equina. I am told I will be given a room and will be next in line for an MRI. I finally get to my room by 6 PM right as my family is arriving and am told I will be taken to another hospital via ambulance to get an MRI as the one they had did not accommodate my size (we tried, I don\u2019t know how skinny people fit in that damned thing it didn\u2019t even fit my shoulders in) and that that ambulance would arrive within the hour. I was also told I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to eat as I was expected to have surgery soon. Well my chariot with flashing lights would not arrive until 1 in the morning. I had stayed awake because \u201cit\u2019s only going to be an hour\u201d and honestly I was afraid if I slept I would shit the bed (not that if I was awake I could have stopped myself). I was taken to the other hospital and had some wonderful conversations with the paramedic in the back, just trying to connect with a stranger, maybe make them smile as it was clear they were having a shit day. I then wait till 6 AM December 12th for my MRI and during which I finally sleep, and boy was it glorious albeit short lived. I get back to my room at hospital number 2 and get a call from my surgeon. He\u2019s just seen the MRI and is giving me the preop briefing then, warning me that if I don\u2019t change my lifestyle after this surgery I will be under his knife again in a years time, and even if not there\u2019s still a 25% chance he sees me again. Turns out he was in a conference in DC and had taken the first flight back for my surgery. I would have felt like a rockstar upon hearing that had I then not noticed my bowels had voided again. \n\nI am rushed back to the original hospital where a surgical team is waiting for me. In the OR, before I\u2019m put under the surgeon is telling me that I will have a partial discectomy on L3-L4, that he is confident there is enough disc remaining that fusion wouldn\u2019t be necessary, which was a big concern for me. I am also told that there is no guarantee that my nerves will come back, but we are still in the window where there is hope. \n\nI wake up in my room around 7 in the evening and immediately feel different. My back feels like someone\u2019s been rootin around in it for sure and there are all the pains associated with surgery but it doesn\u2019t hurt like it did. I started crying immediately. Bawling. To have a pain you don\u2019t realize the extent of disappear like that is incredible. The nurse started crying watching me and my mom jumped up to hug me. They have me up and walking and in that moment I realized the road to recovery ahead of me. I liken myself to a drunk toddler trying to run. Wobbly as a newborn deer and cursing in frustration with each step. Once I get back in bed after walking an exhausting 20 yards I am finally fed. \n\nIt is at this point that I must step aside and criticize myself to make a point. I love food. You don\u2019t get to my size without loving food, and I\u2019d like to think I have a decent pallet. What I was served was 3 hour old, cold hospital cafeteria sustenance. I was told it was either supposed to be or was at one point chicken Alfredo with garlic bread, but my god was that the best meal I have ever eaten. I was at that point 48 hours without food, had gone through the most traumatizing 48 hours in my life and was 100% ready to eat my feelings. Even the nurse was surprised at how I devoured it. I have had many cravings on my weight loss journey, pizza, ice cream, fried chicken. Nothing makes me salivate more than thinking about that damn chicken Alfredo. I was given some of the best drugs money can buy and slept easy and pain free for the first time in a while. \n\nThe next day I get a far better breakfast and am told I will likely be discharged if all goes well in the next few hours. I am issued a walker, which I dubbed \u201cTexas Ranger\u201d as that is the kind of stupid jokes I find hilarious and speak with my surgeon post op. I am told he will see me in a few weeks to evaluate my progress but even then he says words I struggle with every day \u201cWe will not know to what extent your nerves will come back until about a year post op, if some come back at all\u201d. After that I am discharged and my road to recovery begins. \n\nThe first thing I have to get used to is having my parents in my home. I have lived on my own for a few years and love the privacy that came with it. I lost my sexual function so *that* kind of privacy wasn\u2019t the thing I was concerned about, but rather just being alone. But my lack of privacy became clear the first time I had to use the bathroom. Thankfully after surgery I regained control of my bowels but things like wiping my ass, pulling my pants up, getting in and out of bed, yeah all that I needed help with. I cried every time from the shame of it and respect the hell out of my parents for doing it. It\u2019s one thing for mom and dad to say they would I if they had to, it\u2019s another for them to do it and never make you feel judged for it. I\n\n would begin walking as much as I could handle, which wasn\u2019t much and had to deal with the parade of friends coming to check on me. I always tried to smile about it and make light of it but seeing the heart break as they watched their friend shuffle about with a walker will be burned in my memory.  After my 1 month checkup my family determined it was too difficult for me to be so far from their home and so I packed up the essentials and my cat and moved back home to begin PT. PT was the most fun and least fun thing about this whole process. I have a physical therapist who likens himself a comedian/personal trainer and so takes special joy in kicking my ass and I\u2019m better off for it. After 2 months post op I began walking short distances with my walker and a month after that was without it entirely. I will bring it out every now and again for a \u201cThrowback Thursday\u201d to get a laugh out of my family but am happy to report Walker: Texas Ranger is serving dutifully as a coat rack. \n\nSensation wise I have regained some feeling in my left leg. Now it just tingles as though it\u2019s asleep, my right leg or my \u201cshitty leg\u201d as my family and I jokingly call it, is still numb. It feels like I can never really tell where it is in space and so run it into things often, thankfully I can\u2019t feel it, although checking for cuts and bruises has become part of my routine. I am convinced at this point feeling in my right leg will never come back. It was numb for so long before the surgery that hoping it does feels helplessly optimistic to me. Sexual function returned with the saddle sensation and I would say feeling in my groin is normal, but different than it was before. \n\nI still don\u2019t drive and am unsure if I will again, at least not without hand controls. In my 3 month check up my surgeon said my nerve damage is definitely severe but the amount I have recovered so far is exceptional and I should consider myself on of the luckily ones, but I don\u2019t feel like it. \n\nThe biggest thing for me through all this has been the mental struggle. I always felt pride about things like having a good job, my own place, a nice car and just being out there making it and that was all ripped from me. I can\u2019t work or drive, I had to get rid of my place as it was eating a hole in my savings, I\u2019m back at home with my parents, and now I am going to have to sell what is my dream vehicle because what use is something you can\u2019t drive. I\u2019m in therapy each week and have been working through it but each day I wake up hoping this is all some weird dream. I have hit points where I have hated my family because they can walk without thinking about it but am now in the stage where I am wanting to make the most to it, but it is not easy. I have began doing things I never had time for before, things I am passionate about and am excited to do them. I am also of course working on physical health as well as mental, and while going for a run isn\u2019t really an option for me I\u2019m still able to watch what I eat and how much and in doing so am down over 50lbs since surgery.  I\u2019m excited and terrified to see what the next 4 months hold for me and even if I never get the feelings I have lost I think I\u2019m ready for it, but ultimately feel I will come out the other side stronger for it. \n\nI lied, here\u2019s a TLDR\n\nTLDR: Bad back but shit I\u2019m trying. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions no matter how personal, I\u2019ll answer them to the extent I\u2019m comfortable!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_11vavm", "subreddit_subscribers": 152, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Journey with Cauda Equina Syndrome so far - Injury to 4 months post OP", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/muozve/my_journey_with_cauda_equina_syndrome_so_far/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Rrenphoenixx", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_80a1uuik", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1617991350, "domain": "self.CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/mnmz3y/tmi_alert_cauda_equina_and_poop/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mnmz3y", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/mnmz3y/tmi_alert_cauda_equina_and_poop/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1617991361, "score": 1, "selftext": "Sorry this is so gross, but wanted to know if anyone had changes to their stool due to this issue such as constipation or narrow stools?

It hurt quite badly the next couple days, but the pain subsided afterwards. \n\nAfter the injury my lower back only hurt in certain positions, but around 5 months ago the pain in my back disappeared and my my leg started hurting instead. So for about 5 months I have had this nerve pain all along my left leg when I position my back in those specific ways. Around the time the pain moved from my back to my leg, I also noticed that one of the toes on my left foot went almost completely numb, and it has been numb thereafter.\n \nI actually got my back checked out a while back when the only thing I had was lower back pain and he suspected a spinal disc herniation.\n\nThe thing is, for a couple days now I have noticed some slight bladder and bowel dysfunction. At first I thought my underwear was just damp from sweating, but yesterday I felt like I couldn't control my bowel at times and had a small amount of liquid leakage from my anal.

Saw multiple gynocologists and they\u2019re clueless on neuro pain, no luck. Referred to neurologist. Neuro wants to rule out MS even though I have zero classic symtoms. I had a lumbar MRI that came up normal\n\nMain issue: I suffered with an acoustic shock in fall of 2019. It left me with horrible permanent tinnitus, nerve pain in my ears, ear spams, and irritation of my trigeminal nerve. The issue is, loud noise is very dangerous to me me and it has left me pretty disabled. MRIs go up to 110 decibels which has a safe exposure of a few seconds, and sound can travel through bone conduction via your skull \n\nThe Lumbar MRI was already super risky for me but I was in so much pain I decided to get it anyways. I wore double protection, plugs and muffs and while in the moment it was fine, my symptoms severely flared a few days later and I still have not improved (it has been 5 months now) and I can barely leave my house. \n\nMy other pain has progressed where now my genitofemoral nerve Area hurts, pudendal nerve pain, sciatica type pain. Since late summer I\u2019ve had prickly leg pain where it just feels like I have a million little needles digging into my skin and it gets worse with applied pressure like sitting, pants, etc \n\nI have a bit of lower back pain too but the worst area is my legs and glutes\n\nDoctors keep tossing me back and forth and I don\u2019t know where to turn.

Do they show compressions if I had a T-Spine and sacrum scan? More nerve tests? My bloodwork was fine. \n\nThere was a weird thing where something was abnormally high and my doctor said it was because I fasted. She told me the bloodwork was non-fasting...when I mentioned that to multiple doctors they still brushed it off and said it was normal, for ex, the normal range is 20-30, mine was about 100, and doctors said it\u2019s only concerning if In the thousands \n\nI\u2019m just so terrified that I\u2019m gonna end up paralyzed and my other condition is very limiting as I can\u2019t have a ton of MRI\u2019s to rule more stuff out.

My sciatica pain was driving me crazy and I was attempting to live despite barely being able to walk. Eating regularly. Nothing unusual.\n\nWhen October 2020 rolled around...*something* happened to me. I can't recall if it was something big, or the end result of numerous small things. But at some point, I felt major nausea and my bathroom habits were completely disrupted. It became harder to walk and I stopped eating entirely out of fear that digestive organs were shutting down. I was a given a CT scan where it was discovered I have a dessicated and bulging disc. Despite having sciatica and numerous pinched nerve injuries, this was the first time I've heard about a bulging disc. Then I had an MRI which revealed moderate fatty liver - but I think it was only a minor factor in my digestive issues.\n\nI was left with two primary issues - being unable to sit down because it created painful urges to urinate, and drastically disrupted bathroom habits. Sometimes, I couldn't go at all. I was under the impression I could help my disc damage by walking, so I did so, and for a while, it SEEMED to help my bathroom habits. But after my first week of walking, I reached a point where I couldn't walk at all, so I stopped.\n\nThrough November, my bathroom habits were all over the place. But since I was so afraid of eating, I wound up losing about 30 pounds. And slowly but surely, when I reached the middle of December, I seemed to improve. My bathroom habits were back to normal, I felt less sciatica pain, and I felt great. It was like a miracle occurred.\n\n...And then we get to January 4th. I've never felt much back pain, but by this point, I absolutely did, and I decided to go take a walk because I hadn't done so in a while and I thought I was getting sicker because of it. I went through my normal route, and my legs hurt worse than they ever have. I had to stop and turn around. From there, it was like my legs didn't heal, and my bathroom habits became as bad as they were when my issues first started. Urination was OK for a while, but then it diminshed. Even when the amount seemed normal, the stream was always weak.\n\nAnd now today. I felt a strong urge to urinate, which seemed odd since it came from out of nowhere. It felt like I had to fight it back. I went to the bathroom to deal with it, and almost nothing came out. And the best part - the urge didn't go away after I was done. I figured something was wrong and started cleaning up...and then upon checking, it was as if something had leaked out. Not enough to qualify as a stream, but enough to suggest that something slipped out without my input.\n\nReally terrified right now. I had a surgery evaluation planned for the sixth, but since I tested positive for COVID-19, it had to be rescheduled. And I think my disk issue has just gotten worse since then. But throughout all of this, I've been very vocal about my fears concerning cauda equina, and it didn't seem to phase anyone I talked to. I got the impression that I'd need to be unable to walk before they'd think cauda equina was a problem. And I can still walk, but my legs have felt consistently numb lately.

What says tho is that there\u2019s no canal caliber modification exept L4-L5 area where the caliber is ~8/8. \nI am really scared...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_11vavm", "subreddit_subscribers": 128, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Need advice!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/khg0zc/need_advice/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Djenty1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6byqq9g8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1607818723, "domain": "self.CaudaEquinaSyndrome", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/kc0bml/anyone_have_slow_onset_ces_presenting_like_this/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kc0bml", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/CaudaEquinaSyndrome/comments/kc0bml/anyone_have_slow_onset_ces_presenting_like_this/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1607818734, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I work an office job, have been sitting and staring at screens for years all day everyday between that and my side gigs outside of my day job, don\u2019t really exercise, obv sets the stage for back issues eventually. I\u2019m in my late 20s. \n\nBasically had been going to a physio for knee issues summer 2019. They had me do McKenzie push-ups as they thought my knee issues were referred back issues (they weren\u2019t I had never had back issues before and I now know I have grade 1 cartilage damage in both knees causing that pain but I decided to humor them at the time). Basically I ended up getting injured from doing those exercises with the physio. The pain in my lower back was on and off for months in varying degrees of severity after that appointment. Finally I bought a car this past spring and the seats didn\u2019t agree with me and that seemed to push the back issue over the edge. I had severe lower back pain after driving the car 2 hours home from the dealer but initially had no neurological symptoms. After a couple days daily driving and the car as I was trying to see if my body would adjust to the seats I noticed the following symptoms:\n\nHeaviness in both feet (most noticeable when wearing shoes)\n\nConstant urge to urinate (which is only present occasionally now, it stopped being constant after I stopped driving the car regularly)\n\nDribbling slightly after every time I pee unless I wipe myself off (I\u2019ve never had to do this in my life but I have to do this every time now) \n\nReduced sensation of when I would need to urinate until I was absolutely bursting, so urgency\n\nReduced sense of needing a bowel movement (just feels like pressure, no reflexes or waves of needing to go I seem to have lost those sensations)\n\n\nSlightly reduced saddle sensation that\u2019s only noticeable when wiping, I don\u2019t notice it outside of that (it varies in severity in proportion with my other symptoms)\n\n\nAlthough I feel like my right leg has had short bouts of feeling weaker than the left after sitting on a hard seat for an extended period of time, I have never had drop foot, have no issues standing on heels and toes, and very minimal weakness-type symptoms, almost none. \n\nWhen I was in the new car it would seem to make symptoms much worse, and the longer I stopped driving that car and settled for daily driving my other car (which had always been fine) the better the symptoms would get. \nEventually I determined I had to sell the new car as it seemed to be perpetuating my symptoms. I got rid of it and things were somewhat stable, but many things still seemed to bring on the symptoms. Strangely, except for when I do things that specifically aggravate my back pain like washing cars or picking up heavy things, or sitting too many hours at a desk, I have only very little back pain and no leg or foot pain the majority of the time. Also, the foot heaviness was initially only present for a few days after driving that new car and then if I\u2019d spend 2 weeks not driving it it would go back to normal. One weekend over the summer I did a bunch of kayaking then washed the cars on the Sunday and after that day the foot heaviness became permanent. \n\nThings that to this day cause low back pain to increase as well as increased sensory issues in feet and urinary/bowel issues: \n\nSitting on hard seats for too long, driving in general for too long (1-2 hours gets bad)\n\nSitting more than 40 hours a week in an office chair seems to cause symptoms to worsen (obviously)\n\nDriving a power boat (the rocking motion going over the waves flares up the feet heaviness and back pain rapidly)\n\nWashing my cars\n\nPlaying ping pong (on account of the constant bending down to pickup a dropped ball)\n\nI have seen two Orthopedic surgeons and a neurologist about these issues. All say that because I do not have severe pain and can walk fine and have not lost control of my bowel or bladder, I should not be concerned about cauda equina syndrome. \n\nFirst ortho:\n\nYour MRI scan shows a healthy spine, there are no visible disc bulges or herniations however your pain symptoms and what causes them to increase do suggest a slight disc bulge may be possible, but again if you did have one it is not visible on the MRI scan and is very unlikely to be causing your other symptoms\n\nSecond ortho: \n\nYour mri is clean, I agree with the first ortho you saw that you should not be concerned about a herniated or bulging disc causing these issues, go see a neurologist to explore this further. \n\n\nNeurologist: \n\nIf your neurological symptoms were from a disc issue you would likely have much more severe and regular pain issues and they would be referred down your legs. I do not think this is a disc issue. EMG test of right leg is clean, I agree with the other two orthos that your lumbar mri looks clean and healthy. I think your issue is caused by myofascial trigger points which can cause pain and urinary issues and the sensory issues in your foot but I\u2019d like to do an mri of your brain, thoracic spine, and cervical spine to rule out MS (which I feel is unlikely as the patterns aren\u2019t really consistent with that) and any concerns with your spine higher up, but I think the most likely cause are postural issues and muscle imbalances causing myofascial trigger points to be placed under pressure. \n\nAlright so back to my thoughts...\nNow in the wake of all of those appointments, I am not sure what to believe. My only other thought is that I may have a disc bulge that doesn\u2019t show on my mri but would show if I was in flexion or extension during the scan. I wonder if my cauda equina is actively being damaged in a seated position by disc material being pushed against it, but since during a typical mri scan I am in a neutral position it is not showing on that. \n\nShould I continue to see more neurologists regardless of her opinion or if she decides after the other MRIs that we can assume my issue is myofascial in nature should I just settle for that diagnosis and follow her suggested course of action from there?

For the past several days I\u2019ve been drinking a gallon or more of water a day, which is HIGHLY unlike me. When I called the after hours number of my surgeon\u2019s office last night, they told me I\u2019m probably just dehydrated and I need to drink Gatorade or something. I know that\u2019s not the issue. I lay down all day every day. It\u2019s winter so I\u2019m not out in the heat even if I did go anywhere, and it\u2019s not hot inside. I am completely sedentary, and am drinking a gallon or more a day for several days and the dry mouth won\u2019t go away. Even when I was running a marathon, years ago, in 100\u00b0 weather, and super dehydrated, all I had to do was drink water when I got home, and a couple hours later I was fine. But still, I didn\u2019t want to seem like I was making a big deal and end up being wrong and costing us a lot of money, so I drank two electrolyte drinks at 10 PM and 2 AM (woke up because of the pain and haven\u2019t been able to go back to sleep, which has happened every night for weeks). Those were 48 oz total, then I drank half a gallon of water by 8 AM. The electrolyte drinks did NOTHING. Now I\u2019m also noticing I\u2019m leaking small amounts of urine after various movements (like turning over in bed). I don\u2019t know what to do. Part of me says I\u2019m overreacting and part of me is so upset because I felt like the on call doctor didn\u2019t take me seriously.
