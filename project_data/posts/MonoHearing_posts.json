Currently it does not have a built-in hearing test.  It however does provide separate 3-band equalizers for left and right ear, and an overall Volume control.  Big buttons should make it easy to adjust in the field.  And it has low-latency, and is a stable app (tested for 10 hours on single battery charge).  So it could be useful for listening to a lecture etc.\n\nThe app does not have any extra speech enhancement features beyond simple volume and equalizer controls.  If we add a new feature, we will let you know.\n\n\nOnly users with Oreo 8.0 or 8.1 or higher android devices will be able to find it on Google Play by searching \"Hearing Aid for Oreo\" - here is the direct link:\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stereomatch.hearing.aid\nHearing Aid for Oreo\n\nIt is a paid app, but since we are seeking feedback, we have put it on sale for free for the next 7 days.  After that you can still request us for a Promo Code for downloading for free - although those will be limited in number.\n\nThis app leverages the audio improvements in Oreo.  Latency is much improved, making it practically usable for real life use (double echo issue on android is greatly reduced).\n\nThe app is also stable (tested 10 hours continuous use on single battery charge on Nexus 4 running Oreo 8.1).\n\nYou are requested to e-mail us with your suggestions - click Menu - Contact Us to send us e-mail feedback, or reply in this thread.\n\n\nUsage\n\nSwipe left and right with your thumb to move between the 3 screens - Volume, Equalizer and Settings.\n\nThe Volume screen allows to boost Volume easily with your thumb, while the Equalizer has separate 3-band equalizers for the left and right ear (usually you would set this in advance for each ear).\n\nThe Settings screen allows you to choose between input sources and output - you can choose between headset microphone and device microphone, or between earphones or device earpiece or device speakers.\n\nBest results when using earphones or headset for output, and for input using headset mic, or using device microphone.\n\nNOTE: if you choose device microphone and device speaker, it will cause a screeching noise due to the audio feedback.\n\n\nThe app could potentially be used if you have hearing loss, but results will vary - as is the case with most hearing aid apps - some users will find it useful, while others will feel it still doesn't help in speech comprehension.  Age related hearing loss could be compensated by raising the High band on the affected ear a few notches.\n\nApp may also be useful for those without hearing loss - who just want to listen to a lecture in class for instance.\n\nLooking forward to feedback from users.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 554, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[DEV] New Low-latency Hearing Aid type app now available for free (for Android Oreo only)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/8ifc5d/dev_new_lowlatency_hearing_aid_type_app_now/"}, {"author": "time_is_galleons", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1524487716, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/8eb6si/does_anyone_else_experience_thumping/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8eb6si", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/8eb6si/does_anyone_else_experience_thumping/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1524490618, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 8, "selftext": "For the last few years, I will experience a 'thumping' sensation in my left ear (the one I can hear from).

Presented one day after eating lunch, just a snap like a rubber band, sharp pain and a draining sensation and constant ringing. Ringing reminds me of back in the napster/limewire days and downloading a corrupted mp3 that would make that nasty garbled screeching sound. Dr diagnosed it as Labrynthitis, said it was permanent and that I would get used to it over time. Said there was no damage to the mechanics of my ear, but nerve between ear and brain was damaged.\n\nFast forward to now. Still have all the same issues. Garbled screeching sound varies in volume and intensity throughout the day. Constant draining/itchy sensation. I do have TMJ also, and sometimes when my jaw cracks, i get a brief flash of normal hearing.\n\nSaw mention of bone conducting hearing aids and headphones. Wondering if those are worth checking out.

However the common theme I keep getting is that I'm simply not suited to a lot of the jobs I've been applying for due to my hearing. They even go so far as to tell me that my hearing is the factor which led to my exclusion from the hiring process. \n\nI'm not a suitable candidate for a CI or aids, as they either simply will not work or will not improve my functionality significantly, and as far as I know, there is no corrective surgery which would suit me. \nThis has really been getting me down. I've never thought of myself as limited or having a disability. I've always done well academically, made friends easily and I have a passion for learning new languages. But the one career that I've dedicated my entire professional and academic life to I am unsuitable for, and there's nothing I can do. \n\nHas anyone else experienced a similar situation?

Looking in a mirror and not recognising myself.  I never felt there were multiple me's - but I was not the one me, either.  Being so lost in anxiety that I couldn't focus on anything.    I did get through university (and a graduate degree) but have not been able to set any academic, professional, business or relationship goals since then, and have been pretty lost in minor addictions which became major in their impact (food, Internet, etc).\n\nI had 20 sessions of neurofeedback earlier this year which revealed that my brain is pretty damned baked, it looks like a severe ADHD brain though I never had that problem as a teenager.   I developed moderate high frequency hearing loss in my good ear in my 30s and the dissociation and anxiety got worse - I'm guessing they were linked.\n\nI'm now about to start a second round of neurofeedback, though ironically I'll have to remove my CROS because the electric signal would interfere with the readings.\n\nBut it makes sense that my anxiety disorder has been because my brain has trouble processing sensory inputs.  I literally did not consciously think of myself as hearing-impaired until recently, it had been so ignored by my family and by me also.  (E.g. I would use two earbuds without understanding that I couldn't hear stereo).\n\nI feel like when I was 18-25, I was actually trying to make myself deaf in my good ear - going to so many nightclubs and clubs without earplugs - because my confused brain felt on some level a soundless world would have be easier than being SSH but having repressed all knowledge of it.\n\nThese are just some random thoughts.   But I'd be interested if any audiologists reading have a view on the usefulness of neurofeedback for SSH people.   At the new place I'll be doing it, the practitioner has an academic background in neuroscience and is open to using different treatment modalities, so should be as good as they come.\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anyone else suffer from anxiety &amp; dissociation before getting a hearing aid/CROS?

He listens to music almost religiously, but it took me a few years to realize that he can only hear one half of the music through his headphones! There are many pieces of music that have different left and right channels, and some of them are very drastic - for example, having one guitar be entirely on the left channel, another entirely on the right.\n\nConsidering that he is an audiophile, I decided that it would be great if I could find a device that combines left and right audio into one channel. Just to clarify, I am looking for DAC/amp that has the option of changing a single stereo input into a single mono output. I have already asked on r/audiophiles and r/headphones, but as these communities are more broad and this is not something that most people desire normally, I had little success in finding what I was looking for. I was hoping that perhaps in this community, someone would have had a similar situation and found a work-around.\n\nThank you for your time!\n\n**WHAT I HAVE ALREADY FOUND OUT:**  \n1. Various plug-ins for various music players. I want a physical device that does this because he can plug-and-play it anywhere, and because not all music comes from his laptop.  \n2. I know about Virtual Audio Cable and Equalizer APO. Same limitations as above.  \n3.

Since you were all so helpful the last time I posted here, I thought I would provide an update.  Not long after I posted, we got the news that my insurance company agreed to cover the cost of the CI.  My surgery date was yesterday and my activation date will be in 2 weeks.  Since posting here I have also connected with many other SSD patients who are doing great with their CIs and who also got approval from their insurance companies.  \n\nI understand that getting a CI is a big step and may not be for everyone, so I am not advocating for it one way or another.  Everyone should do what is best for them. Just wanted to post this here in case anyone else is looking for SSD/CI/insurance info, like I was a few weeks ago.\n\nThank you again and good luck to all of you on your hearing journeys.\n\n\nOP:  \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/5ull0l/if_you_have_a_cochlear_implant_and_single_sided/\n\nHi all, new here.  Lost all hearing in my left ear about 5 months ago due to labyrinthitis.  My insurance company has denied my request for a cochlear implant, stating they don't cover CIs for unilateral hearing loss.  We are working on filing an appeal.\n\nI know that there are some folks out there with CI and SSD, and my question is, did your insurance company pay for it?  And if so, would you mind sharing your experience?  How did you get them to approve your claim?\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update - Single sided deafness, cochlear implant, insurance", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/6462f9/update_single_sided_deafness_cochlear_implant/"}, {"author": "WarpedWarpDrive", "author_created_utc": 1491219730, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_16qw5m", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1491551597, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "edited": 1491558889, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/63z1v8/creating_music_when_trying_to_sleep/", "gilded": 0, "id": "63z1v8", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/63z1v8/creating_music_when_trying_to_sleep/", "retrieved_on": 1494570632, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Ok so this is really wierd by i recently lost all hearing in my left ear (6 weeks ago, mastoiditis which seems common for this sub).

I'm not totally deaf in that ear, but it's pretty useless. I've been having a trial of a BAHA on a soft band and I'm a bit undecided if I want to go ahead or not. Note when I say BAHA the one I'm trialling actually is a Cochlear brand, but if I go ahead it may or may not be - so by BAHA I mean the generic term not Cochlear specifically.\n\nI have discussed stapedectomy with my ENT but we're not doing that at this stage - just so you know I've considered it. She suggested if I do go BAHA then to use an attract/magnet system.\n\nI'm told the soft band isn't as good as the real thing, but my experience so far has been that the BAHA definitely improves my hearing, most notably for what I might call environmental sounds. Things like clinking glasses, closing doors, tapping, scratching - all that stuff. For music and conversation it's louder generally but if I cover my good ear the sound quality is as if I'm listening through a telephone. Okay, but not great. And I don't *think* it makes it easier to focus on a specific conversation in a noisy environment. Is this typical of the BAHA experience? For those who have had a soft band trial and then proceeded, is the real thing *significantly* better than the soft band or is the difference only marginal?\n\nI have read at least one post on here before where the author said the BAHA was terrible, they gave it back and regretted ever going through with it. Does anyone have one and think it's great, or are they meh at best? Just FYI, I believe at this stage my health insurance will totally cover the cost if I do go ahead, so that's not a factor.\n\nThanks for any thoughts...", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Happy with BAHA?

I'm a student at university and a musician/music teacher. \n\nAbout two weeks ago I woke up with very loud tinnitus in my right ear. I went to the ENT the next day only to realize that I could hardly hear out of that side. He started me on two different types of steroids and I will be going back in in a couple of weeks, but I am not doing much better.\n\nThis has been very hard for me at my job and at school. What I do hear in my right ear has distorted pitch and it's making teaching music difficult. I can still do my job. It's frustrating and a little bit heartbreaking, but manageable. With other situations, however I haven't been eager to participate. I haven't been going out much because \"loud\" spaces are overwhelming and I have a hard time distinguishing speech. This brings me to my main point.\n\nI have hardly gone to class since this has happened. I am in a foreign language class and it's just about impossible to understand what is going on. I can hardly understand what any professor is saying. Sometimes they'll play videos online and they're low quality and it sounds like mush. I think it's the acoustics of a big, echoey room that make it difficult to follow discussions. So, it's extremely discouraging for me to go to class.

to?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe found out my son was totally deaf in his left ear at age 4. His hearing in his right ear is perfect, and he has adapted so well to only hearing in the one ear that we had no clue until he was 4 that there was any issue. I only suspected something because he couldn't tell where my voice was coming from if I called his name outdoors and he didn't see me right away. After the audiologist told us about the deafness he told us \"Oh yeah, this ear doesn't work.\" \n\nAt age 4, I was told there was nothing we could do. Hearing aids wouldn't help, the end. Then last spring we learned that he could wear either a CROS or a BAHA. The audiologist talked us into the BAHA even though I was leaning towards the CROS because I knew he'd have issues with the headband required with the BAHA. She told us we could switch to the CROS if it wasn't working out (this ended up being wrong, and insurance wouldn't allow us to switch). So he had the BAHA all summer, he liked it, but he was super self conscious about the headband. No amount of \"You look like a ninja!\" could convince him that it wasn't noticeable and weird, but he wore it without too much complaint. Then at the end of the summer, the processor popped off during a bike ride and disappeared for good. He came home with only the headband. \n\nSo, a replacement (our one and only under warranty) was ordered. We pick it up next week. He's been fine without it. He does say it helps him hear, but he's pretty easy going about it, and couldn't care less when he doesn't have it. When he lost it he was more concerned that I'd be angry that it was lost than in actually losing it. \n\nI'm considering not making him wear it. I know the audiologist and HH teacher at school are going to give me a hard time about the decision. He uses an FM system at school, and he does fine with it. The ear piece he wears is tiny and not terribly noticeable. It's also more comfortable for him than the BAHA headband, which he was constantly having to adjust. He would use the BAHA and FM together if he wore the BAHA to school. \n\nSo, I'm curious to hear from others with SSD. Am I wrong to not make him wear the BAHA if he doesn't want to?

experience with the Phonak CROS II.\n\n**TL;DR**: I got a demo model to try on and it really was quite amazing technology. Unfortunately, I couldn't get use to it. :(\n\nBackground: I'm a 50yo man with congenital nerve deafness in my right ear.\n\nAfter reading it about the Phonak CROS II here on this Sub Reddit, I found a audiologist in town that had a demo unit for me to try. I went in, had a hearing test, and they fitted me up. The way it works is that you wear TWO hearing aids. One that picks up the sounds on the deaf side and wirelessly transmits it to the ear on your good side.\n\nWhen they turned it on and tested it the difference was immediate. I could hear tiny ambient noises with utter clarity. The doctor turning the pages, writing with the pencil, tapping her foot... small things I'd not noticed before.\n\nAs I wore them throughout the day, two things became clear:\n\n* The sound sounded \"processed &amp; artificial\"\n* There was something in my good ear that felt like it was \"blocking\" the real sound.\n\nThe 1st point is easy to explain. The sound *is* processed &amp; artificial. There's really no other way to do it. All sound from the room goes DIRECTLY to your ear canal from a tiny ear piece. Which brings me to my 2nd point, it blocks any natural sound.\n\nIt's hard to explain, but I just came to the conclusion that I would rather hear natural sound (albeit *less* of it), than hear processed sound (and WAY more of it!)\n\nWe went to dinner the first night I had them and I was overwhelmed by the background noises I never heard before. I could hear the clanging of the pots and pans in the kitchen, then shuffling of feet, my partner chewing across the table... And at that point, I realized that my deafness wasn't such a handicap after all...\n\nThis is especially complicated for me because of my misophonia (look it up...). I can get really irritated by specific sounds and boy-oh-boy does the Phonak CROS II work well and finding a LOT of those irritating sounds I was \"missing out on\" before! :)\n\nIn conclusion, the Phonak CROS II is amazing technology and I can certainly see it as a great solution if I had fit a different demographic... Perhaps younger or had non-congenital SSD then it would bring back something that I'd lost...\n\nI was very thankful to the audiologist for their time and I do want to thank Phonak for having a demo unit availlable and for their amazing technology. I would recommend to ANYONE that hasn't tried them yet to get a demo and try them for yourself.

Sometimes they opt to use TeamSpeak or some other voice-chatting software, and while I don't do any talking myself, I mute my game and listen in. However, I'm having pretty huge issues understanding people's speech. Even with the game entirely muted, I find it difficult to understand people over TeamSpeak, especially if there's some kind of background noise or lots of people talking at the same time.\n\nThis is just a shame, really, because I end up being left out of a lot of things said on TeamSpeak, don't know what's going on often, and so on. I'm sure I'm not the only one in a situation like this. I was wondering if there was any solution for me? Maybe some kind of audio enhancing / noise cancellation software or hardware I can buy to help me discern speech better on TeamSpeak?

I had tinnitus from a previous event 7 years before. I was habituated. Accompanying the deafness, I had severe vertigo, and the same intensity tinnitus (probably a 3/10). As my hearing came back in the following weeks, my tinnitus greatly increased to an 8/10, and my noise sensitivity (hyperacusis) is unbearable. I've always been a musician, DJ, and in general passionate about music. I've been to many doctors, ENTs, Otolaryngologists etc. I'm not adjusting. I'm not coping. I was just diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I'm supposed to see a psychologist soon, but I don't know if I'm even going to be alive to see that through :( Everyday is a struggle. I've had suicidal thoughts every day for the past 3 months. I never thought I'd be one to kill myself, but it seems more attractive each day. I'm 19, and I can't imagine living with this for another 60 years. The only reason I don't do it is because of my family and my dog. They would be devastated, they're Christian so I'd 'go to hell', but everyday is hell. Every fucking day is living hell. I drink/smoke myself into a coma every chance I get because it's the only thing that lets me get some reprieve. I've always been an athlete, but I can't compete with my balance problems. I have a full ride academic scholarship to the top university in my state, but I can't focus anymore.  I just want to end it. I used to cherish silence, but I'll never have that again. I don't want to sound like a whiny kid, but I'm at my wits end. I've got pills, a gun, a rope. I just want a painless way to slip into whatever lies beyond here. Maybe I'll order a suicide bag.

For anyone who wants to skip any/all of this and go straight to just the details, I will add them at the end.\n\nFor those who might be interested, I\u2019d like to tell my family\u2019s story. And to be clear: this is extremely cathartic and gratifying for me. But I don\u2019t really want the takeaway to be just that (or that at all, if I can help it). This was a journey, and I\u2019d like to share - and discuss if anyone is interested - everything my wife and I learned along the way. And as a side benefit, perhaps I can offer a bit of insight into the other side of this experience for many of you on this sub. Rather, instead of being the person who has hearing loss trying to bridge a gap, being the hearing person (parent, sibling, friend, etc) trying to do the same thing.\n\nI never expected to be here. There is no one in my family, nor my wife\u2019s family, that has any type of congenital/genetic/trauma-induced hearing loss. When I was in school [over a decade ago], I ended up in a short elective track that included \u201ccommunication with disabilities\u201d and a semester of ASL; but it was only because I thought it was really fun and, personally, a superior alternative to standard language classes. Outside of that rather trivial experience*, as far as I know, no one that I\u2019m related to by blood or marriage had any experience with hearing loss until us.\n\n(*I\u2019m also not counting \u201cspeaking at higher volume when interacting with the elderly\u201d even though my wife\u2019s family has a number of long-living individuals.)\n\nMedically speaking* my wife had a standard pregnancy. We decided we were ready to start the family phase, my wife got pregnant, and a full term later we were in a hospital room. The next morning, a nurse did a newborn hearing screening. She said she would have to come back to try again because the right side failed. The next morning, the same thing. The next morning, upon the third failure she told us that we would need referred to an audiology clinic just to make sure everything was cool. We were told this happens somewhat regularly due to fluids, misreadings, etc and we would be in and out in 15 minutes. Three weeks later, we were decidedly not in and out in 15 minutes. \n\n(*Warning, quick tangent: For me, on a personal level, things did not turn out so standard. The day my wife told me she was pregnant, upon calling my parents to tell them the news, I was informed my parents also had news of a sort: a few hours earlier, doctors had found spots on my dad\u2019s liver and my mom hadn\u2019t worked up to calling me yet. Later tests would confirm a type of the worst - stage 4 melanoma. The day that we received the actual diagnosis from our audiology referral, I called my mom to tell her the news. She had to call me back because she was in the act of meeting with doctors telling her there was nothing else they could do, and they recommended my dad to be put on hospice. He passed away five days later, half a day before our flight left. I only include this side story because it is an important part of how I have been able to process what we have gone, and will go, through. The timing of it all still sounds like a bad movie script, but because it happened that exact way, I\u2019ve been able to internalize a lot of what I will try to say later with a bit more resolve/perspective than I otherwise would have been able to.)\n\nAs a parent without any expectation or knowledge, the process of that first ABR happens too quickly to actually take anything of substance from. Because our referral indicated the right side had failed the newborn screening, the audiologist started on the left side. It was over and done with in minutes - just as expected. But the longer the right side took, the bigger the elephant in the room (and in my mind) became. There is little about the experience, even now, that I remember in vivid detail. And those details will fade in time. However, there is one specific thing I will not forget: at some point I became aware of something different in the room. If I had to over-psychoanalyze the situation, it was likely denial that caused me to take so long to process what the difference was: I could hear the earbud that was inside my daughter\u2019s right ear. She was sleeping cradled in my lap and I suddenly had the distinct impression that a rock concert was going on inside her ear...and it wasn\u2019t waking her up. And even with having that realization, when the audiologist sat down in front of us later, I felt blindsided by the words, \u201cYour daughter has what is called profound hearing loss in her right ear. She is completely deaf from that side.\u201d We were given a 15-20 minute explanation of what this meant and handful of pamphlets. Then we were driving home.\n\nIf there are other parents reading at this point that can relate, they will likely also appreciate what comes next: nothing. And by that, I mean, nothing happens unless you go out and make it happen. No one* comes to your door and offers to try and counsel you through the countless questions, concerns, and confusions that hit you over the next few days (...weeks...months...ok, I made my point). It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t any people out there who can answer the questions, or groups to provide the support and education, we simply had to find them on our own. \n\n(*To be fair and not over-dramatic, the school district (Los Angeles Unified) we are in did call a couple of months later to set up an early start program.)\n\nI drove home in that previously mentioned car ride asking myself \u201cpeople can function essentially the same on one kidney as two, what makes ears any different?\u201d That\u2019s literally the question I asked myself. I want those who scoff at it, which I would find no fault with, to know where I was. I spent a few hours every night for the rest of the week reading any first-person account I could find on the internet. I wasn\u2019t ready for the medical information yet [which would basically say the same thing anyway], I wanted the people who lived it to tell me what was different.\n\nIt took me the better part of a year following that personal crusade through googling \u201cdeaf in one ear\u201d to be able to get through an entire meal at a restaurant without fighting off tears. I don\u2019t know why that particular scenario became my pain point, I can only say that it was. People with two ears, and I am not exempt from this, can not understand how much they take it for granted. No matter how aware you are of your ability to localize and filter sound, it is the only reality you know. I did a pretty good job torturing myself listening to every single clink of a glass, scrape of a shoe, and whatever else would take away from hearing the person across from me if I lost the ability to filter them. Although I can\u2019t promise myself that it won\u2019t bother me when it creeps up in actual examples later in life, I have come to terms that I will never be able to relate to my daughter\u2019s world, and vice-versa, in what we hear. It is easy to say: well that is true for any two people, because everyone is different. But there is different, and there is [actually] different.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know who to ask. We didn\u2019t know what to ask. So we just asked anybody we could find anything that we could think of. It turned into some combination of making our own luck (we were determined to find anything/anyone we thought would help us) and being lucky (living in Los Angeles means a lot of great resources are available). Four months later we were attending John Tracy Clinic every friday for their parent-infant education class and inquiring at House Ear Institute about obtaining a BAHA softband. We specifically ended up at House because the audiologists in their children\u2019s department were cool ordering a softband for us at five months rather than the normal six months provided we stuck to a plan of moving it around and progressively ramping up its use instead of going all-in right away. (The reason this is important is that you don\u2019t want to overuse a headband on a young infant because their skull is still soft and developing.)\n\nAnd we felt we had a lot of success with the softband. It took the rest of that calendar year, but we got to the point where she would wear it all day without any fuss. In behavior/booth tests this year, she was testing as well as mild-to-moderate loss on her deaf side while wearing her headband. It was a positive experience, and we\u2019ve met other families and other adults who wear a BAHA (both softband and implanted) with varying levels of positive results. In fact, our very first thought about a cochlear implant was not of interest in pursuing it, but rather a sense of leaving no stone unturned. As far as we understood at the time (9-10 months), it wasn\u2019t really an option for us. But with a small understanding of the anatomical requirements, we simply wanted to know if it was even possible. And so, without really meaning to, we slid the entire CI eval process - most notably, the MRI - through health insurance coverage, because it doubled as relevant medical understanding* of the original diagnosis.\n\n(*An oversimplified explanation of what that refers to: In order for someone to qualify for a CI, they must have a cochlea that is well formed enough for the implant to fit in, and they must have an existing auditory nerve for the implant to stimulate. A missing nerve is one of the more common reasons for congenital unilateral profound loss. Knowing if it exists is absolutely relevant information for someone looking at available options, both options that exist now and those that may be available at some point in the future.)\n\nAround this time, I had the following conversation at a get-together with some friends. It could serve as a microcosm for how I feel about much of what we have experienced as parents:\n\n&gt; \u201cHey man, do you want me to hold her while you eat that burger? You look kind of uncomfortable.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u2018Oh, no. Thanks though. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m left-handed, so I\u2019ve had to get used to holding her with my right arm so I\u2019m on her left side. It\u2019s a work in progress.\u2019\n\n&gt; \u201cWait...what?\u201d\n\n&gt; \u2018Sorry, I can never remember who we\u2019ve talked to about this [when it comes to people that aren\u2019t part of the core group when we hang out]. She\u2019s deaf on her right side, so I always make the effort to make sure I\u2019m on her left if I can be.\u2019\n\n&gt; \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re really close to her, I\u2019m sure she can hear you either way.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u2018Possibly, but more practice only makes me better at this.\u2019 (inner groan)\n\n\u2026skipping ahead a bit...\n\n&gt; \u2018And right now, we\u2019re really starting to look into the possibility of a cochlear implant. It seems like an exciting possibility with what we\u2019ve been able to research so far.\u2019\n\n&gt; \u201cUmm, are you sure? Have you ever heard what one sounds like? I had to do that [for one of my biological studies]. You should look it up on YouTube. I don\u2019t know if you want to mess up her good hearing.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u2018Well...we\u2019re still figuring it out\u2026\u2019 (inner sigh)\n\nI\u2019m not trying to make that guy look bad. He absolutely meant well. He\u2019s a smart dude who has worked with biological research companies and may apply for a PhD. It\u2019s just ignorance...I could have been talking to my past self two years out of college. But the more I read, the more I wanted to find out. If you google any variation of \u201cssd|unilateral aid|cros|baha|ci study|testimony\u201d, over the past year I\u2019ve probably read any link that shows up on the first 20 pages of results. My wife and I have spoken to audiologists from all over the country via email and over the phone. I still am actively seeking out those opportunities.\n\nThe more I studied the subject, the more convinced I became that this was something we should pursue for our daughter. My wife felt the same way. Nearly every professional with an interest in this rather specific field that we talked to said something very similar to, \u201cIn ten years, implants for single sided deafness will definitely be a more common thing.\u201d But waiting ten years was not an option for us, not with knowing how much \"earlier is better\" when it comes to CIs and congenital hearing loss.\n\nMost medically advanced countries are now actively pursuing adults who want to join clinical studies for implants and other technology aimed at trying to provide access to [more] sound for people with unilateral hearing loss. There are professionals out there trying to be progressive, but there also is a very pervasive sense of fighting against decades of stagnation. Nothing summarizes this more than the letter we received from our insurance company when we threw them a hail mary to try and have a cochlear implant surgery covered:\n\n&gt; \"You have requested a cochlear implant for your child\u2019s hearing loss on her right ear. Her hearing on her left ear is normal. Her speech is developing well. Children develop normally with one hearing ear. Therefore, the service you have requested is not medically necessary. The appeal denial is upheld.\"\n\nWe fully expected a denial. Once we reached the point where we knew this was something we wanted to do, our eyes were wide open to the likely possibility we would be doing it ourselves. Currently, the only FDA approved options for our daughter are conduction aids (BAHA, CROS) which carry sound across to the good ear. So the denial itself was not a game-changer for us. It still sucks to feel like no one cares, but we had planned for it. But I wish they would have just said \u201cIt\u2019s against our policy. So no.\u201d Instead, by trying to validate their stance, they just put voice to all the struggles we felt. Things like the fact the first two audiologists we met with never introduced us to the idea of a conduction aid (or...much of anything else for that matter). The feeling like something was being glossed over when we talked to our pediatrician and she waved her hand and said \u201cIt\u2019s OK, kids with one ear definitely perform just as well with language acquisition.\u201d Every time someone said \u201cOh, she knows that word!\u201d without seeming to understand our constant and consistent effort to make sure she learned her words from the left side. No one seemed willing or capable of addressing the fact many of our worries, concerns, and dreams for our daughter weren\u2019t tied to the size of her vocabulary in first grade.\n\nSo I wrote back to our insurance asking for documentation, studies, etc that validated that wording. To date, according to their own policies, they have five days to get back to me. No word yet, but I\u2019m not going to hold my breath because I\u2019ll have to start calling them in a few days asking what happened. I did, however, want to share a particular part of my letter:\n\n&gt; \"And to be clear about one last thing: children with one hearing ear can overcome any and every obstacle that their handicap produces for them. If your definition of \u201cnormal development\u201d is simply that the person has the potential ability to deal with their own disability, then I would happily agree with you on that endpoint (but not that it defines normal). But I\u2019ve come to the opinion that children with unilateral hearing loss - be it mild, profound, or anything between - are largely ignored by the current medical world. Although that trend is gradually changing for the better, these children are largely misunderstood and, in ways, forgotten because although they may slip a little, they do not slip dramatically enough, or in large enough numbers (because there aren\u2019t many of them to begin with), to warrant the type of attention that would produce large scale social/medical change. The majority of the world (medical subparts included) seem be stuck in an antiquated position of \u201cyou have one ear, so you\u2019ll be fine\u201d while it falls entirely to the children themselves, and any family or friends who support them, to make that a truth.\"\n\nAs soon as the appeals process was finished with the denial, we got to work. Over the next 48 hours, I would estimate 30-40% of my time was on the phone or writing emails. We had waited long enough trying to do everything the official/normal way, and now we needed to make it happen. So much research shows the benefit of being implanted as young as possible, and we were antsy after months spent going back and forth with insurance. And so less than a month later, we were scheduled for surgery (again, working with House).\n\nWhy did we decide to go through with it? We just want to provide any and every opportunity we can for our kids (she\u2019s the only one at the moment, but the second is on the way). The technology is proven on every level, someone just has to be willing to put all the pieces together. There are many successful cases of implantation in single-side patients that have been published, even with children. I\u2019ve talked to audiologists that have been part of teams that have worked with nine, six, and five year-olds. There is little to no precedent for infant implantation, especially in the US because of the FDA. But there is plenty of precedent for both standard bilateral implantation in infants (they can adapt at that age, and often better than anyone else) and bimodal infant implantation (hearing aid on one side, CI on the other - and yes, this is FDA approved). We don\u2019t feel it is being reckless to assume that our daughter can adapt to both the CI and the fact she will be merging it with existing acoustic hearing if we continue to help her to do so.\n\nBecause I don\u2019t want anyone afraid to ask a very obvious question: The price for the entire process was quoted to us at 52,000 USD and we paid slightly over 38,000. The reason for the difference is that we got to cut off all the costs related to the pre-eval since we snuck it in when we were still just curious. It was all of our savings and then some. Both of our parents were willing to help out so that I did not have to pull out of my retirement funds, but I was more than ready and willing to do that if it was necessary. Both my wife and I work good jobs and are fortunate to even have that type of liquidity available to us. We know that other families will not have this option, and we\u2019re hoping that we can be one small part of instigating changes so that this will not be a roadblock for others in the future if they hope to go down this same road.\n\nAs for the device, we went with a Nucleus 6 from Cochlear. There were really two reasons that I can point to: The first was we already had a relationship developed with Cochlear from a year with the Baha 5, and we had loved our experience. For us, there was no reason to change unless it was compelling. And along those lines, the most compelling detail for us was the internal portion of the device (specifically the part that rests between the skull and the skin) from Cochlear has a much thinner base. This is, in no way, shape, or form an advertisement or recommendation for Cochlear because I'm not here to try and influence a decision that should be a personal one. If anyone is reading this specifically for the implant part of the story, and is trying to decide which brand/device to go with, know this: you can\u2019t make a wrong decision, you can only make a right one. They are all proven to show positive results, so don\u2019t second guess yourself. Find the feature(s) that mean the most to you and go with them. Don\u2019t be afraid to get a second, third, and fourth opinion and weigh them all as you see fit, but ultimately trust yourself.\n\nThe surgery itself went off like gangbusters. We were in the hospital at 5:30am, we separated in the OR\u2019s ICU at 7:30am and were back together in that room by 9:30am. After a few hours of recovery sleeping, we left the hospital at approximately 2pm. She was up by 5pm and acting like herself for a few hours before crashing again with the help of a small dose of tylenol. The day went by way more seamlessly than I thought it would. My wife needed a moment when we got back into the ICU and all the monitors were still hooked up (prior to surgery, we separated before they put in the IV and took her under), but aside from that we both were rather composed. We let ourselves have a little time once we got home and she was asleep again, but even that felt subdued. The only point that stands out in my memory was having the surgeon walk into the room and tell us everything went well. When the words came out of his mouth I had a very similar reaction to hearing my daughter\u2019s heartbeat for the first time through an ultrasound. It\u2019s a difficult thing to describe...it\u2019s a visceral, physical feeling.\n\nIn a few weeks, we will be starting an entirely new journey as a family as we work to help her brain make sense of the new input coming in from the right side. We are incredibly excited. Right now we haven\u2019t planned for much beyond designating a small amount of time each night to make sure we sit on her right side and go over songs, books, toys, etc that she is very familiar with to try and help her start making the necessary associations. Other than that, we\u2019re going to start trying to focus less and less on making sure input is direct to the left side and play it ...by ear? To be blunt, we\u2019re making it up as we go, and are always open to suggestions.\n\nOne kind-of tangential point I wanted to add, but had nowhere else to put it. If any of you in this sub have ever wondered by so many of you that grew up prior to newborn screening went undiagnosed until years later (I\u2019m not sure how this comes across in text, but I\u2019m not trying to imply you have any level of resentment for that happening, just curiosity), I wanted to add two cents: I\u2019ve known since nearly day one, and I don\u2019t think I can count to ten individual instances where her hearing loss was obvious to me. I can say with near certainty, I would have no idea right now if it wasn\u2019t for the screening. As a parent, you laugh off your child falling, misusing words, and everything else that comes with going from a blank slate to ...something else. A few turns in the wrong direction (and later on, a few extra whats and huhs), well, I can\u2019t imagine I ever would have noticed.\n\nI wish CIs weren\u2019t such a polarizing topic among some people. I think it\u2019s sad. People always get way too extreme about one side of a topic/argument/whatever and lose the value of what they\u2019re trying to say. We live in grey area, most sides of a coin have some validity. A question that both my wife and I have struggled with, in different ways, over the past 18 months is \u201cIs your daughter perfect just the way she is?\u201d And my answer to that question would be, \u201cIf it was medically possible, I would donate her one of my ears in a heartbeat.\u201d Getting her a CI has nothing to with bridging that previously mentioned gap between us and making her part of my \u201ctwo eared world\u201d because if I would leave it if it meant she could enter it. She is still, and will always be, deaf on that side. What we\u2019ve been able to do is simply the best that we feel we could do.\n\nSo along those same lines, if there\u2019s a parent that ends up on their own google-quest someday and you stumble across this, and you\u2019re so determined to mine answers that you can get the entire way through my rambling, I would tell you this: be willing to break down doors, but be even more willing to listen to your kid (and the younger they are, the more abstract the idea of listening has to be). I would recommend it, but an oral program like the one we\u2019re at in JTC is not going to work for every child. I am a strong proponent of them, but a CI is not a technology that will help every person. You have to be willing to pivot, no matter how badly you may want to go in a certain direction...even if it\u2019s the first step of admitting they have a hearing loss. I know there is nothing holding our daughter back from doing whatever she wants to do, and the same goes for your kid - whoever you are.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you. My google docs tells me this is going onto page 8 in the default 11 pt type size, so I hope it was somewhat worth reading. I made this reddit account specifically to share this with you guys, and since I\u2019ve been lurking here, I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed it. I don\u2019t mean to sound an ounce ironic or pandering when I say that you guys who contribute here are all amazing. So thanks for that too, sincerely, from a dad that didn\u2019t have a clue.\n\n-------------------\n\ntl;dr - I\u2019m the dad of an 18 month old girl who was born deaf on one side. Monday morning, she underwent successful cochlear implant surgery. It has been a long, provoking journey; and will continue to be. Under current FDA regulations, a CI is not approved for someone without hearing loss of some level in both ears, and so insurance would not cover this, and so we had to pay for it.\n\nHearing: normal left side, profound sensorineural loss on right side\n\nGenetics: No history (or experience) with hearing loss on either side of the family.\n\nDiagnosis: multiple ABRs following failing newborn screening\n\nCI Device: Nucleus 6 from Cochlear\n\nTotal Paid: ~38,000 USD\n\nFeel free to ask me anything (just without the AMA-level response times), and I\u2019ll add to this list as it seems prudent.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "There are very, very few SSD kids with a CI.

"score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I posted this in a few other places over the years and it seams fitting here as well. These here are a good addition for anyone with conductive loss, single sided or both...... also the picture is old, and was my poor attempt at a beard...... http://i.imgur.com/aJmgkuE.jpg\n\nAlright, lets do a review of the Bone Conductive AfterShokZ M2\u2019s shall we? First, these can be found at any Office Depot in the USA, for roughly 62 bucks, there is a cheaper version of the M2\u2019s that are an older model, and don\u2019t have some of the features and there is also a wireless, Bluetooth version as well for around a hundred bucks. I decided on the M2s\u2026.\n\nNow if you are an audiophile, stop reading now, cause these babies wont be for you. Unless you enjoy listening to what is paramount to speakers in a coffee can. They are bone conductive, so don\u2019t hit the lows such as normal speakers, and obviously work by resting on your cheek bone and vibrate causing sound to radiate thru ones whole head. I also had to adjust my volume output on my computer to 100% on my bad ear and roughly 60% on my good ear, so the \u201csound\u201d was equal, course this will vary per user. I also had to adjust the mixer to mellow out the highs, with bone conductive devices the highs can be a bit, shall we say, painful. All in all the sound is pretty impressive and they have a built in battery that can be charged with a USB chord, that amplify the sound levels to ranges that I can only describe as mind boggling, I cannot go full power on them, much to loud.\n\nThey also have a built in speaker and button as seen in the picture, so you can hook em up to your phone and use them as a hands free device.\n\nAs for comfort, I am very satisfied, fit nice and snug and don\u2019t move around, and although my daughter is 4 she can sorta wear them but are still a bit to big for her. I would imagine they would be perfect for 8 years and up comfortably. only real issue with them is listening with them in bed and my pillow tends to push them a bit forward. And while listening to them while charging, the 2 chords, one that plugs into the speaker port, and the other for charging, can be a annoying.\n\nSome solid plus\u2019s for this device, the price is cheap, the quality and warranty are fantastic. Also, with them blaring you can still hear all that is around you. These could definitely be used for parents and young adults that hear fine, and the charge for amplifying lasts quite a long time, although I havnt timed it.\n\nAll in all I would rate them a solid A as a hearing impaired person with microtia/atresia , and as a 1 eared audiophile I would rate them as a C-, for clarification of the C-, I do want to add that in my mono world with one ear only, they do not compare in sound or quality to a good set of BOSE, but I cannot hear or feel high quality headphones in stereo, I can with AfterShokZ.\n\nParents with kids over the age of 8, or adults with microtia/Atresia, or the normally impaired persuasion, I cannot recommend these enough. They are, for me, mind blowing. Sure I can sorta hear/feel stereo with high dollar headphones, but not with the clarity that is provided with AfterShokZ. Obviously these are not meant to be a replacement for a BAHA or other devices, but if you don\u2019t want to wear something clunky and want to just sit back and chill, these are the thing to have.\n\nSo Folks, Christmas, and the holidays are fast approaching, and these would be the ideal stocking stuffer for all. I cannot recommend these enough if one has never had or worn a BAHA, or has been locked in a mono world such as I.\n\nI am not a paid spokesman for AftershokZ nor have I stayed in a Holiday Inn Express lately.\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "AftershokZ Bone Conductive Headphone review.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/48a5zg/aftershokz_bone_conductive_headphone_review/"}, {"author": "gruffi", "author_created_utc": 1354020670, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_9q52w", "created_utc": 1456740737, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/489jvy/for_uk_monaurals_phonak_cros_on_the_nhs/", "gilded": 0, "id": "489jvy", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/489jvy/for_uk_monaurals_phonak_cros_on_the_nhs/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "kPNsQnGfULSi-ItDbVejYWDgwTKLS4HrS9RkpyzM5RM", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Yvxv5QMiN1MaWnxEt26ywU-W3B_7P5FSKvk4YgA8Z2s.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=c91cf34c3407b2f6fd79c0ff38a3cb7b", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Yvxv5QMiN1MaWnxEt26ywU-W3B_7P5FSKvk4YgA8Z2s.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=7a791b52c17f9e96e91de139b0b595c8", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Yvxv5QMiN1MaWnxEt26ywU-W3B_7P5FSKvk4YgA8Z2s.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=4ddc76deca09908b975deab8473097a8", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 330, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Yvxv5QMiN1MaWnxEt26ywU-W3B_7P5FSKvk4YgA8Z2s.jpg?s=b1d09f5a2ca9ce3f87d41a16d3478361", "width": 330}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1459227782, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I asked Phonak if they were able to provide a list of NHS trusts offering their CROS device.

I can vouch for the quality of Ikko's IEM's too.

I try really hard to make other friends but nobody seems very interested in hanging out with me and I always seem to get cancelled on. \nMy roommate and I also clash because she loves to blast music at home and in the car while trying to talk to me and i just can\u2019t focus with all the noise.

I can\u2019t promise you\u2019d never have to speak some Latin for your teacher, but it\u2019s much less of a headache to read off some Latin than French (or in my selective opinion, Spanish). \n\nHowever I should say that it\u2019s nothing easy to try to tackle either of these languages, I opted out of Latin after a few years because it\u2019s just extremely demanding, and ASL is beginning to show its challenges as well, but having that level playing field between hearing impaired and not doesn\u2019t come everyday, so it\u2019s really a nice surprise to find it, especially in another language, where I\u2019m sure many of us that had the stress of taking foreign languages class in high school and college.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1208, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Taking American Sign Language (and Latin) has to be one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made so far in college.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562364618, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/c98dkx/taking_american_sign_language_and_latin_has_to_be/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "GloverCom", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_eh3ga", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562079430, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/c8a7vh/2e1_two_ears_in_one_l1_headband/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c8a7vh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/c8a7vh/2e1_two_ears_in_one_l1_headband/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "hmGKaOXDvwo4ArMcGqAl1z8xYseVrvqRb3HgTaewqAI", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/VYhobY3ilkoaAlGecD1EHF53DdCI0wKXZVolVXUwVK0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b015fafd5156b204bc858de73efcefa893a04e66", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/VYhobY3ilkoaAlGecD1EHF53DdCI0wKXZVolVXUwVK0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80f555cca07a5b75b78496449883f74e2a4a7c79", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/VYhobY3ilkoaAlGecD1EHF53DdCI0wKXZVolVXUwVK0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=834c6b0565d92bacd27a775702d7f2ed59606647", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 400, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/VYhobY3ilkoaAlGecD1EHF53DdCI0wKXZVolVXUwVK0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e371269aa0351f880aa56ac0de8b5ecce881383c", "width": 400}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1562081190, "score": 12, "selftext": "Just got the 2E1 \"Two Ears in One\" L1 Headband.\n\nI use them for gaming on my PS4 and find they work well.\n\nI've had SSD since birth, so the only comparison I can give is between using a mono adapter and these.\n\nThe difference is subtle, but the pseudo-stereo sound certainly FEELS different.\n\nAs a gamer, the best example I can give is when another character is speaking, I don't have turn my character to my good side, just like in real life!

Does anyone know if this can lead to anything more serious in life?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z",

I was ten years olds (M19 now) and playing in the neighborhood with some fairly new friends I had met, two of which were twins who my ten year old self found very attractive. A few weeks after meeting them and hanging out around the neighborhood, we had come to know everyone quite well and things were meshing well. My friend and I figured the best way to impress these girls was to do ride down some big driveways on our ripsticks (a skateboard essentially, but with two wheels). After having some success trying it on our own, we wanted to show the entire group what we\u2019ve figured out.\n\nFast forward a couple of hours with everyone present, and I was going down the hill, right after I had finished going down the driveway, I lost control of my ripstick behind me and fell forward out from under it. The last thing I remember is barely seeing my friends looking back at me from the top of the driveway and blacking out. I was apparently out for about 15 minutes, and when I woke up my dad had arrived with some other parents and proceeded to take me to the E.R.. The whole drive I was told I was coherent in my speech but I kept on drifting in and out of sleep and I had no control of my eyes. When we got to the E.R., they told us that we needed to go straight to the hospital and they would call ahead so they would expect us. (Mindful I was told all of this in detail after the accident as I remember very little and only in small choppy clips.) When we arrived at the hospital, my mother was already there and they asked for her signature to prep me for surgery, which totally blindsided her and scared the hell out of her.\n\nAfter five hours in surgery my parents finally were told what happened during the surgery. When I hit my head against the concrete it had jumbled my brain around and nicked an artery in my head, causing major brain swelling, as well as a major concussion. Had I arrived there later than when I did the doctors were convinced I wouldn\u2019t have made it. The other major thing they told us is that due to the brain swelling, my cochlea was filled with blood and that would cause my balance to be way off, meaning I had to relearn how to walk. I stayed in the hospital before I was released home after four days since my dad worked from home and could care for me full time. It wasn\u2019t until a month later that we found the only major long lasting injury from the accident.\n\nWe had an ENT appointment a month after the surgery, to make sure the blood had left the cochlea and my hearing would return, but when we arrived they started talking about my options for hearing aids, mentioning Cros Aids and the BAHA. Very confused from this the ENT doctor explained that my cochlea had been completely shattered during the accident and they weren\u2019t able to tell previously because it was full of blood. I hadn\u2019t the slightest clue what that meant for my future, but at the time I wasn\u2019t as bothered by it had I known what I know now. \n\nWhile the accident did result in a lot of pain and adjustment, I believe that the path it led me down resulted in just the person I\u2019m trying to become today. Because of the major concussion, I was no longer allowed to play contact sports, but I had started to focus on golf anyways. My deafness resulted in a smaller friend group, but we grew incredibly close and tight knit because of it. And I believe the traumatic incident led me to become an Analytical Psychologist that I\u2019m currently studying at University, realizing how quickly life can be taken away and how rewarding even the worst situations can be is an incredible blessing that could only take years to comprehend.

Tell me if you agree or not with what I\u2019ve found out so far.\n\nTL:DR:\nPeople with SSD have a dulled timbre, have more difficulty in social situations, and can face educational difficulties in comparison to two eared individuals.\n\n\n\n    An estimated 10% of the world population suffers from Single Sided Deafness (SSD) (Meehan et al., 2017). SSD is the loss of hearing in one ear, creating an asymmetrical auditory complication in individuals who have it. This can include conductive or sensorineural hearing loss and is often a permanent condition. The psychological aspects revolving SSD are recent discoveries, coming into academic research since the early 1980\u2019s. Individuals who experience SSD in their lifetime can expect to experience a dulled timbre, difficulty in social situations, and potential educational difficulties in their learning processes.\n\n     Because of the nature of our auditory processes, there is incredible benefits for having two seperate conducts of hearing. These separate conducts allow humans to regularly orient themselves correctly in the world with little need for worrying about whether or not their auditory senses yield them incorrect information about the nature of their environment. This evolutionary advantage provides humans with a surround sound like experience that we use to perceive our surroundings, regardless of our visual stimuli. When you remove one of these conducts of hearing, and are left with only one functional ear, the information is received with much less timbre than before. This disorients and confuses common sounds known to the human ear and creates a dull and linear progression of all sound entering the hearing ear. If a person with Unilateral Hearing Loss hears a knock on a door in a movie, they then may then feel the need to check their own door to ensure that no one is there. This distrust in auditory stimuli can force other senses to work harder to understand the world around them, which can tire out people with Single Sided Deafness (SSD), increasing irritability, sadness, and anger at the unfixable aspects of SSD.\n\n     Humans have a non-communicative agreement about the necessary amplitude in which they use to exchange information verbally with each other. For example, a person in a loud restaurant is able to correctly adjust the volume in their speech so that their counterpart across from them can understand them clearly and coherently, even if the two have never met before. This agreement of communication stretches across all cultures, as the necessary conditions for hearing do not extensively vary across the world (Dube, Kung, Peter, Brock, and Demuth, 2016). However, a person that has hearing loss in one ear is thrown into this agreement of communications without the necessary equipment to sustain a large variety of social situations. This consequence of unilateral hearing loss encourages negative psychological and social responses to the outside world. Individuals with SSD might more often avoid going out with new people, or even friends if they know the social circumstances of the event will be loud or above a certain decibel threshold (Lucas, Katiri, and Kitterick, 2018). This retraction of social interaction will often result in a permanent alteration in the personality of the individual over time, leaving them lacking in social skills, avoidant of potentially loud settings, and increased loneliness.\n\n     Half of all children with SSD will either repeat a grade or receive special assistance at some point for learning disabilities in their lifetime. (Tharpe, 2008). The work of Robert F. Oyler, Anne L. Oyler, and Noel D. Matkin (1988) highlight that students with SSD are at risk for academic difficulties when compared to their normal hearing counterparts. While a range of reasons can be analyzed as to why this distinction is, one of the basic elements arrived at is that these students receive half of the auditory information towards them and were expected to process these events as fast as normal hearing individuals. Unilateral Hearing Loss creates a lag in time to process the auditory elements around them, perceiving these children to be slow or mentally incapable to other children. These negative connotations are readily noticed by other students, creating a negative environment of potential bullying and ridicule from others. The psychological impacts of bullying are well documented, symptoms include anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and suicidal ideation (Sansone and Sansone, 2008).\n\n    In conclusion, Single Sided Deafness has deep intricacies revolving the psychological aspects and consequences from it. 60,000 people in the United States suffer from SSD (Meehan et al., 2017), with 9,000 new individuals diagnosed every year. With this substantial amount of people, the necessary research into this project has the backing needed to continue and create the most effective solutions possible. Suggestions for current people with SSD can be a variety of options, however a necessary decision should be to attend a form of counseling in which you are explained the variety of issues and complications you may face in daily social circumstances, and ways to conquer them, rather than avoid them.\n\nReferences:\n\nLucas, L., Katiri, R., &amp; Kitterick, P.

I decided to write here since at this point would love a second opinion based in any of your experiences.\n\nIt all stared in Aug 23rd. It was Saturday. I just got groceries and was unpacking them when I hear a pop and then I stop hearing. I went to the Dr in following wednesday. Did an audiometry in Friday and got my diagnosis. By the next Saturday I started to take 60mg of Deflazacort for a week and 24mg of Bethaistine. At my 10th day started to go do hyperbaric sessions. 10 in total. All this time no tinnitus and vertigo in one occasion that lasted like 5 seconds.\n\nAfter a month I gain some hearing which I feel great about. Did another audiometry and it showed progress. My DR recommended still taking medication although lower doses and nothing changed. I got two intratympanic injections that triggered a prior trauma I had making me really stressed. That and COVID didn't help with my stress and my dr and I decided to try the hyperbaric again with 40mg of steroids (up from 20). I waiting a week to do hyperbaric again. I felt like I was gaining a bit more of my hearing but at a very slow pace. The week following the sessions I felt my hearing remained the same.\n\nThis past Monday 19th I got tinnitus for +-20s and then I stop hearing for a bit. Little by little I started to hear again that same day but I felt I struggled more to understand. I felt like I took some steps back in my progress. Got another audiometry in which I'm doing good in the high frequencies but my lower frequencies it appears that went almost back as I started. My DR said it can be related to stress and prescribe .25mg of Alprazolam and would check me again after two weeks.\n\nI've been taking steroids for two months now and I'm really bummed up about my semi progress and worried about secondary effects. Not sure if I still have hope. I didn't know I could \"go back to square 1\". Do I still have hope? What other options should I consider?\n\nAny guidance would help.

I\u2019ve got the headband on a trial for two weeks and I\u2019m in my first full day. \n\nAnyon care to share their experiences?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2140, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "BAHA disorientation?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/jiyjft/baha_disorientation/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "kelmgl343", "author_flair_background_color": "#ddbd37", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Left Ear"}, {"a": ":Left_ear:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/sln18qqxal611_t5_3ct5z/Left_ear"}], "author_flair_template_id": "15256174-7a3b-11e8-837e-0e5ace2388ea", "author_flair_text": "Left Ear:Left_ear:", "author_flair_text_color": "light", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_748bb4os", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1603692736, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/ji9gox/worth_it_to_switch_to_iphone_with_cros/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ji9gox", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/ji9gox/worth_it_to_switch_to_iphone_with_cros/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1603692747, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've only been living with my SSD for 8 months and am so happy to have found this little corner of Reddit.

I don't notice much of a difference wearing them so far, but I assume they might be more helpful post-pandemic when I find myself in social situations more often. For now, I'm wondering if maybe I'd like them more if they worked with my phone. (I'm an Android user.)\n\nPeople with CROS + iPhone, ideally formerly Android, do you think it's worth it to make the switch? What specifically is your favorite benefit?\n\nAre there any Android + CROS users out there that refuse to switch on principle?\n\nObviously it probably is worth it to switch just to be able to not have to take out my hearing aid to use an earbud with my phone, but I'm feeling grumpy about having my hand forced. I had to shell out over 3K for hearing aids and now another chunk of change for a phone that works with my hearing aids? \ud83d\ude43 Is this my only option if I don't want to buy an iPhone?

Is this something that will be less pronounced if I recover more of my hearing? I think I would do ok in social settings with the one ear, but the white noise is making things a lot harder. \n\nAlso, I would appreciate to get some informal opinions on what my prospects of recovery might be, I guess the positives are that: I'm in my 20s, I started treatment relatively early (lost the most significant portion of my hearing 3 days ago, however, it might have started 2 days prior, and I took the first dose of prednisolon today) and lastly, by using headphones with an online frequency generator it seems that I've already recovered some of the hearings  :D. (Does anyone know if recovery usually is a stable process or if I should expect frequent relapses?)\n\nThe negative would be that the hearing loss was severe (70-80ish DB on the audiogram across the board)\n\nSorry for the confusingly written post with  parentheses following every sentence  (just had a lot on my mind)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit":

I mentioned that since I\u2019d be leaving soon, perhaps we should play it safe just in case and try the latter. I am on day two and haven\u2019t improved at all.

I had a hearing test yesterday and both the 250hz and 750hz moved up to 25. The 500hz is still stuck at 35. I was shocked but totally grateful of the development. Hearing is still muffled with minimal distortion.\n\nTinnitus (500hz) has also decreased substantially. I only hear it in a dead quiet environment. My challenge now is that this has been joined by a low humming that I haven't heard before. I matched it to about 125 to 130hz and sounds like an motor engine running from afar. \n\nSo it's a mixture of good news and (slightly) bad news. I'm Still praying that the 500hz will follow suit plus the low humming to be transient. \n\nAny advice on how to manage the low humming?

I worked for two years in a cube with my deaf ear toward the door and hated it, but I was too nervous to ask for accommodation when I was brand new in the office. I've had monohearing since I was a year old, but was deeply embarrassed about it all through school. I'm not sure exactly why. Maybe it made me different and I didn't want that. Anyway, telling people and especially asking them to help me out has been a surprisingly hard skill to learn. I still hate drawing attention to myself in that way. \n\nBack to the point - my office building is getting remodeled while we are working from home, and we got the floorplan for our cube layouts. I noticed it shows everyone's right side toward the cube opening. I need my left side towards the opening so that my hearing ear is towards people approaching me, which happens a lot because answering questions as they come up is part of my job. In my recent one on one meeting with my supervisor I asked for my desk to be placed so that my hearing ear faces the opening. I was so nervous to do it, but he immediately said of course that's an accommodation that can reasonably be made. He also asked about whether I can wear hearing aids, and I told him I think so.

That was around 18 months or so. Had my latest evaluation last month. \n\nRecap: As I explain in the last postings - removing the tumor by surgery - especially a big one - causes stress on the nerves that control the facial muscles. The facial muscles all pass through  the same nerve cluster the ear nerves that get the *vestibular schwannoma* tumor pass through. So they will get stressed as the tumor is sliced off. In my case there was no recovery and one of my surgeons became concerned and said that there is a small window to reactivate the cheek muscles or they atrophy and never recover. If the nerves don't recover they can take a piece of your inner thigh muscle and transplant it into your cheek to get it to be the new face muscle - but I DID NOT want to go through that. So I opted for the nerve graft surgery - and I was at the very tail end where the nerve graft surgery would still be viable. I literally saw saw the doctor count on his fingers the number of months since the AN removal surgery. April 2018 and nerve grafting December 2018. It was almost too late to do it. \n\nSo here I am 18 month later and the results? I can smile again - I have t o clench my teeth to smile - but I can smile again. I can hold air/water in my mouth and puff up my cheeks. I can't open smile yet or it ever - it maybe possible nerves  take forever to heal up but I don't think an open smile will be possible. I just whistled as I was typing this. I was never a good whistler but I can do it again! \n\nI think my balance is OK but still something to be mindful of. I am glad I had my surgery when I did - I can't imagine surgery in this Covid-19 environment. I posted these update s to inform those going through an acoustic neuroma, from diagnosis to recovery.

On day 1 and 2 we shot guns without any hearing protection (9mm pistols). We probably blasted like 100-200 rounds. Even after first day exposure i had muffled hearing, dizziness, ringing. And then on the second day we did same thing so me (being young and stupid) put a nice cherry on top.\n\nMy right ear recovered but left didnt. I guess it was due shooting position as left hear was facing the gun when aiming and right was more covered.\n\nOn third day I went to ENT and she diagnosed me with SSHL since i had classical symptoms: big drop on high frequency audiogram on my LEFT ear, dizziness, ringing in left ear.\n\nI was put on steroids and recovered majority of the hearing. Still have ringing and around 25 db drop in 6000 and 8000hz in the left ear. I am now saving earing as best as I can.\n\nHowever, out of curiosity I researched my diagnosis and it seems that majority of SSHL doesnt have acute noise exposure as a trigger.

But to be honest, all the hearing aid options annoy me - my ear canal always starts hurting about halfway through the day, the feedback can be aggravating, and I'm constantly fiddling with the BTE piece (it gets caught in my hair, pulled off with my sunglasses, caught in my @&amp;$\\*# mask strap, you name it). I'm hoping to consult with my audiologist soon about maybe moving to a BAHA option - the Ponto or maybe the new Osia - or possibly one of the new CROS systems since I do have excellent hearing on my good side (although they also go in the ear canal like my current aid).

I lost all hearing in my left ear around \\~2-3 years old. My family tell me that before the hearing loss I was pretty much the classic example of an extroverted toddler. I was the kid that loved having a ton of friends to play with all at once and who yelled \"HI!\" at every single person we passed in the grocery store. I'd escape my family's pew at church and go visit every single person in the congregation during services. \n\nBy age 4 I was the kid who had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, from the car into preschool. I was the kid who had meltdowns screaming that everything was too loud. I was the kid who loved being put in time-out because it was quiet and I could just spend time alone looking at books. \n\nWhen people talk about the classic introversion/extroversion things, I never know which I actually fit. Like does a party exhaust me because I'm an introvert? Or does a party exhaust me because I'm expending huge mental effort to hold conversations amidst the background noise and am overly self-conscious about how I have to angle my head and body to hear someone or how many times I've had to ask someone to repeat themselves? Does the thought of going out to a quiet dinner with one friend appeal to me because I'm an introvert? Or does it appeal to me because I know a dinner with multiple friends is going to be in a larger restaurant with poor acoustics and I might not get the seat I need at the table and end up feeling unable to socially participate? Does the thought of a weekend all to myself appeal to me because it gives me energy, or does it appeal to me because it means I'm 100% in control of the noise &amp; conversations that I'll have to deal with during that time?\n\nOn the one hand the answer doesn't necessarily matter - my left auditory nerve is dead, so my hearing isn't going to change.

For those who don't know the fancy terms, that means I have some skin tags/cartilage nubs and no canal instead of a right ear, along with some other facial/jaw malformations unrelated to hearing, but that I'm happy to talk about if you want to PM me.\n\nYesterday, after 27 years, I finally received my first hearing aid, an Adhear, which is a non-surgical type of BAHA device. I would have preferred the surgical option, but due to health insurance reasons, the Adhear was my best option, even if it isn't as good at amplifying the higher-pitched frequencies that I have trouble with.\nMy audiologist did some testing and found that after several weeks of trialling different devices, my sentence recognition got much better - my hypothesis is that because I was born with my hearing loss, my brain never formed certain neural pathways to better interpret sounds coming from my inner ear (which is intact). I suspect that after a few weeks of having all this new data to interpret (and headaches to match), my brain formed those connections and my ability to successfully understand speech in noisy environments went from 30% unaided and 60% aided all the way up to 40-50% unaided and 90% with my Adhear.\n\nUnfortunately, the adhesive only lasts 4-5 days and I have to wear a retention clip in case it falls off unexpectedly. I've been told about Benzoin Tincture to sooth irritated skin and improve stickiness, but haven't managed to visit the pharmacy for some yet.\n\n* I'm looking for tips, suggestions and other advice, or even just anecdotes from people who have had adhesive devices (or just others who have had bone-conducting hearing aids) that you wish someone had told you when you were in my position", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1978, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why did I not know this place existed?

Should I get a hearing aid? And when? My loss is mild (the ENT couldn't stress how lucky I am - 250 and 500 Hz are at 40db, 750 at 30db) and in the low frequencies. I get annoyed with the \"echo\" that my ear is producing when it picks up high frequencies. I want to balance this too with learning how to habituate with the sound quality and the tinnitus\n\n2. What hearing aid should I try to research?\n\n3. Any tips for covering your ear when going out? It hurts when I go to out and get exposed to noise that I can't control. I'm thinking of buying ear pods to stick in my ear. \n\n4. I'm on extended steroids and my ENT doesnt want to talk options with me until the meds end. Should I push for salvage treatment like HBOT? \n\nThank you in advance to those who will comment! \ud83d\ude4f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1955, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just more questions, please indulge me.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/i227t4/just_more_questions_please_indulge_me/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "theonlychildspeaks", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6j259lsf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595906253, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/hz712m/sshl_being_menieres/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hz712m", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/hz712m/sshl_being_menieres/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1595906264, "score": 1, "selftext": "It is truly a sad and tragic situation.

Two weeks ago today I had my first symptoms of SSHL (unknowingly). It began with a clogged ear sensation and an attempt at eardrops/quick trip to an urgent care where they \"irrigated\" my ear to no avail. Overnight the ringing got worse and I was diagnosed after an audiogram test with an ENT the next day with SSHL in my right ear as my hearing test showed a 85db loss. I began Prendisone (a 60mg taper) that day (one day after symptoms began) and things began to slowly improve. One week ago today I began my first Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber Treatment and a hearing test done yesterday shows that my hearing in my \"bad\" ear is now only at 25-30db loss! I'm not entirely sure if it was the Prednisone or the HBOT that helped more so, but encouraged regardless. I will have a professional hearing test done next week to confirm and have an update once I complete 10 HBOT treatments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few questions I have to this point...\n\n1. Is it common for recovery to \"digress\"/for the SSHL to return after completing treatments? I'm anxious and fearful that my recovery will suddenly halt and the symptoms will come back.\n2. Although my hearing loss has diminished, I still have quite loud ringing/tinnitus. Should this fade away over time?\n3. I got an MRI done to rule out an acoustic neuroma, but should I consider having additional tests done to check for things like autoimmune disease, Meniere's, etc.? I don't have any vertigo and it may be worth noting that I had Covid 19 one week prior to SSHL's onset so it may have led to it...\n\nAny tips are appreciated!

In fact, I've always loved vintage music and the modern stuff doesn't really do it for me, and I think the reason is that SSD stops me from truly enjoying the flashy production of more contemporary music. I also like a bit of classical music sometimes because it's a great anxiety reliever. Currently a song I really like is R.E.M.'s *What's the Frequency, Kenneth*. Why? I'm not sure actually.\n\nBut I'm definitely interested in your musical tastes because I think SSD might influence it quite a bit.

Essentially, we're going to picking up where we left off.\n\nLast time, I asked everyone's thoughts about getting an intratympanic steroid ear injection after a 9 day course of prednisone.\n\n5 days into my prednisone treatment, my hearing felt as though it had fully recovered. The following couple days, my hearing felt a little muffled again (not as bad as initial onset though). I felt desperate to get started on injections.\n\nFollow up with ENT happened on January 3rd. During that time, we discussed possible causes and the potential for steroid injection. I did a test for Lyme disease (I had a tick bite a few months prior) and an MRI.\n\nNegative for Lyme and any other indications of it. MRI came back fine, except for some inflammation in the right side of sinuses.\n\nFast forward to Tuesday, January 11th. Day of injection. We discuss the MRI and ENT doc prescribes me azithromycin as a method of reducing the inflammation (an alternative to the prednisone, which she was aware I was averse to).\n\nInjection time. I don't believe the numbing agent worked all that well because injection was painful. Dizziness was intense and lasted longer than I've heard others report. Everything ended up alright though.\n\nI decided to keep my ear as protected as possible from the elements and any risk of infection, so I kept a cotton ball in my ear overnight.\n\nWoke up next day and hearing in left ear was messed up. \n\nToday, my hearing is still messed up.\n\nAlthough hearing has improved some over the week,  it's ***worse*** **than before the injection.**\n\nIt's as though my ear is plugged from congestion. High frequency sounds are clear, but mids and lows (especially sub bass frequencies) are scooped. Ironically, the sensation is similar to when I first experienced the SSNHL--as though my hearing is occluded.\n\nI also developed tinnitus in my left ear in the last few days. It's a light wind/air blowing noise. Very subtle, so I'm blessed there, but I didn't have tinnitus before.\n\nHow long does it take to recover from an injection?

We would love to listen to your feedback for improvement on the features. The closest and most popular similar technology that we\u2019ve seen is [Buzz for Sound Awareness by Neo Sensory.](https://neosensory.com/product/buzz-otp/) Our team would want to take a slightly different route and provide sound localization. \n\nSo, what are your opinions on this piece? How helpful do you think this device will be to your daily life and work? Is being able to locate the source of the sound sufficient? ***If you can design this device, are there any other features that you would want to be included?***\n\nYour input means a lot to us.

I hope everyone\u2019s 2022 is filled with happiness and wellness.\n\nNow, on to my post\u2026\n\nFor context, I\u2019m a male in my mid-20s. I\u2019m a writer and musician. I\u2019ve played instruments since I was in 2nd/3rd grade starting with piano going all the way to producing electronic music currently. I sustained hearing loss to my right ear in January of 2017 after listening to music too loudly (I had other unhealthy habits that didn\u2019t help as well). From what I can deduce, I didn\u2019t experience any damage to my left ear. I\u2019m blessed that the hearing in my right ear recovered over the course of 2017.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been faced with hearing loss of a completely different kind.\n\n**Tuesday, December 21**  \nWoke up with muffled hearing in left ear. It left me distraught and confused. I wrote it off as an odd anomaly and did nothing about it.\n\n**Wednesday, Dec. 22.**   \nNo improvement. Did a bit of research and identified my issue as possibly SSNHL. Went to urgent care late afternoon. Prescribed 20mg Prednisone with referral to ENT. Started Pred immediately.\n\n**Thursday, Dec. 23**  \nENT visit. Audiology showed hearing loss in left ear as follows:  \n\u2022\t-5 dB at 250Hz  \n\u2022\t-5 dB at 500Hz  \n\u2022\t-10 dB at 1000Hz  \n\u2022\t-20 dB at 2000Hz  \n\u2022\t-25 dB at 3000Hz  \n\u2022\t-20 dB at 4000Hz  \n\u2022\t-25 dB at 6000Hz  \n\u2022\t0 dB at 8000Hz\n\nAfter reading stories from many other people who have experienced SSNHL, I realize my case isn\u2019t all that bad. Disappointing and disheartening, sure, but not terrible by any means in the big scheme of things. I\u2019m counting my blessings.\n\nDoc prescribed stronger burst Prednisone: 60mg/3 days, 40mg/3 days, 20mg/3 days.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I should\u2019ve pressed doc for an MRI and blood work to rule out possible causes.\n\n  \nNothing noteworthy occurs over Christmas weekend.\n\n  \n**Monday, Dec. 27**  \nAfter reading a single (anecdotal) research paper indicating the benefits of zinc, I start a 15mg supplement alongside my Prednisone regimen. I notice some slight, yet the most marked during my treatment thus far, improvement shortly after taking the zinc.\n\n**Tuesday, Dec. 28**  \nHearing significantly improves. Continues to improve through Thursday.\n\n**Thursday, Dec. 30**  \nHearing weaves in and out of being effectively improved to slightly muffled earlier in the day. By the end of the day, hearing is the best it\u2019s ever been since before this all started\u2014I believe my hearing has basically recovered.\n\n**Friday, Dec. 31**  \nHearing slightly plugged when waking up\u2014I struggled to get enough sleep (Prednisone life) and believe that this is more low level congestion than the muffle that I\u2019ve identified as a result of hearing loss. Hearing is good again after 20mg of Prednisone.\n\n**Saturday, Jan 1st (11 days since onset)**  \nHearing muffled again. Worst it\u2019s been since about Monday/Tuesday. Hearing improved marginally after 20mg Prednisone dose for the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve been reading posts in this sub and on other related forums and haven\u2019t encountered any experiences in which people\u2019s improvements have diminished like this. Rather, I've read occurrences in which SSNHL reappears a while after a full course of treatment and recovery.\n\nI have a follow up with ENT scheduled for Monday, Jan. 3. Audiology and doctor again. Are intratympanic steroid injections the next step? Are such injections given at the ER at all? Should I try to get the injections ASAP or wait for my appointment?\n\nIf I can\u2019t get any injections over the weekend, should I pop more Prednisone? In addition to my last 20mg dose for tomorrow, I have a surplus of four 20mg tablets from when I was prescribed at urgent care. I\u2019d prefer to not go this route: Prednisone is tough on me physically and mentally. Thumping heart (especially at night), odd bloated feeling, mood swings\u2026I\u2019m sure many of you can attest to your own problems with Pred. As soon as I started Prednisone, all I've wanted is to be off of it again. But I'll also do what it takes to get my hearing back...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Have you ever lost ground in your recovery of hearing during treatment? Does the ER do intratympanic injections and, if so, is it worth getting them now (11 days since onset with waning recovery) if I can, or should I wait until scheduled follow-up with ENT on Monday?

about what I had sshl and the treatment started 2 weeks after I started the sshl.\n\nA week ago I took the exams of audiometry and verbal audiometry, while audiometry improved, the reception of words has not improved much, I could only recognize one word, and that is that while they did it I could hear some words, but not enough to know with certainty what the word was,  tinnitus change sound and disminiose, even though I get used to it\n\nThat same day I saw the ent, he thinks that the chances of having greater improvements are not many although not impossible, but even so he gave me a treatment with medicine + zinc for three months which is when I would perform the exams again and consult with him once again for the final diagnosis to see if I can be a candidate to use a hearing aid\n\nEven with that, I still do not lose hope, but there are days that if it is difficult to maintain it, although I am already getting used to hearing from only one side, I would also like to recover the right, even if it is using an auditory device, because although there has been improvement, I still cannot hear a conversation, only metal noises, which at the beginning did not spit and that with the passage of treatment have decreased (I think this is due to that I can hear more noises according to the audiometry), for example when bathing, I still hear it sometimes, but not as much as at the beginning.\n\nAlso try to grab a call from the right side which is where I have the deafness, although something robotic was heard, I could hear it enough to answer although I think it is because I receive everything from the left ear lol\n\nNow, my question is, has anyone who has had sshl after the injections + prednisone has had great improvements perhaps not in the period of the first month, but from the second to the fourth month of treatment?\n\nThe last thing the ent told me is that I could be a candidate for an implate, but being honest where I live is very expensive and preferable if I could a better hearing device, but for that my right ear has to heal even more, and as I said I do not lose hope, but there are days that it is difficult for me to maintain it :(",

Spinny vertigo, too, but that seemed to ease into a general disorientation that's been mostly a constant. Sitting definitely settles things down. \n\nNo idea what the root cause is. I tripped at work late in August, fell on my left side, but my shoulder took the brunt. And I got my Moderna booster exactly 3 weeks ago. Not sure if either of those two unrelated things could have anything to do with this. Obviously I'm just in that 'racking my brain' phase. And really grateful this subreddit exists.\n\nI had a teleconference with my primary doc the day it hit, but they were closing early for a xmas party, so she scheduled me for the next day, Dec 10. Once there, she said the ears looked 'clear', and the scope test they did with the tones confirmed I detected no sounds in the left, and was missing some low tones on the right. \n\nShe palpated both sides of my jaw, and said the left side definitely felt inflamed, then sent me home with a sample tube of Voltaren, an anti-inflammatory. Skeptical that it could be that simple, I've been using it anyway, but can't say I've noticed improvement. Perhaps less wobbliness.\n\nShe also got me a referral to a local ENT, but told me to wait to hear from them Monday for scheduling. Since I understand time is of the essence in having the best shot at improvement, I'll call them Monday regardless of that advice, and will emphasize \"sudden onset\" to get this moving. As of Dec 11, it feels the same as the first day \u2014 no improvement in hearing, or the intermittent disorientation, though fortunately no spinning, just some mild waves of nausea here and there.\n\nI suspect we all agree that it really sucks to have worrying symptoms develop RIGHT AT THE FLIPPING WEEKEND :(.  \n\nMy questions for this group: \n\nIs it worth an emergency room visit to try and get prednisone into my system faster? Or is Monday soon enough? That would be the 5th day.\n\nAssuming I can meet with the ENT on Monday, is it important to seek out an Audiologist as well, or does that come after the ENT has put me through whatever regimen they prescribe? Which I assume from reading will be prednisone. \n\nShould I be insisting on an MRI right away, or is that too aggressive/expensive to just launch into? If an MRI is done, I understand it can be with and without contrast (as if I even know exactly that means \u2014 I do not!). Is it best to do both scans?\n\nSince I'm barely 3 days into this, I don't know what I don't know.

I\u2019m 18 and today I got diagnosed with sudden sensorineural hearing loss in my right ear. Unfortunately, recovery isn\u2019t looking hopeful. Nonetheless I thought I\u2019d share the story thus far.\n\nAbout 6 weeks ago on October 20th, I suddenly became very disoriented. Within a couple hours my hearing in my right ear completely vanished and was replaced by ringing/a radio-like noise. I was nauseous, dizzy, and I couldn\u2019t keep balance as I walked. It was so intense that I was tempted to leave halfway through a college class. I had to stay at my friend\u2019s dorm because I was too scared to drive home that night.\n\nI went to an urgent care the next night and they diagnosed me with BPPV. I took the medicine they gave me for that for the next week but almost no improvement showed. My family and friends convinced me that the hearing issue was due to wax buildup so over the next few weeks I frequently attempted to clean my ears. \n\nFinally I had enough and I called an ear specialist and I got an appointment scheduled. I went in, and they said that I had a bunch of wax in my right ear so they gave me drops to break in up.\n\nI came back in today for them to remove all of the wax. They did, and asked me how my hearing was. I told them that there was no improvement and they seemed shocked. So I went and got an audiometry test done. They told me I have SSHL, most likely caused by a virus I had back in October. I start oral steroids tomorrow and ear shots soon but since I\u2019m 6 weeks in recovery is very slim.\n\nSince October 20th, the nausea and dizziness have mostly faded away. My brain has mostly adjusted so I only occasionally have bouts of balance issues and the radio-like noises. The ringing is pretty consistent but sometimes I can block it out. I have major issues with sound localization and I get overwhelmed in crowded places. The hearing loss never got better.

On youtube, there is barely any videos of anyones experience with the device, besides the ones from MED-EL themselves. \n\nDay of activation went well! The audiologist hasn\u2019t activated one for a long time and took her a while to get it up and running. They will do a beep test with the device on to see where you are hearing with it on. They did give me a warning that I will not get a \u201cwow\u201d factor since I have a good ear (right side) and my loss is a conductive loss. I was very much aware of this but was pleasantly surprised how different it sounds from a hearing aid. \n\nIt sounds much more natural in a way that I can\u2019t really tell that I\u2019m wearing a hearing device. It still sounds like its coming from a tunnel (when covering my good ear) for me but I can hear what people are saying on my left side now, which is great. It sounds balanced. \n\nMagnet strength I have is a 4 and might ask to go up to a 5. So far I have no irritation from the device.

It\u2019s 5 years next year since I woke up and lost the hearing in my right ear (that was an amazing Christmas\u2026.). For various reasons it took time before I got to the ENT, and so I started oral steroids after about a week. \nThat was all I was offered and those didn\u2019t work. I had a really bad ENT that didn\u2019t explain anything. He told me I had what\u2019s popularly called sudden deafness, and I should start steroids and that was that. \n\nSo google has been my friend and I just recently found this subreddit. I guess my goal is more information, if anyone has had similar experiences or just any kind of knowledge. \n\nI don\u2019t have any vertigo but I did (especially in the beginning) walk around a lot feeling off balance, on my 3 year check up I got another ENT and was told my balancing organ (?) is dead. Information that would\u2019ve been much appreciated at the beginning. Not that easy finding a lot of information about online. \n\nI tried various hearing aids - cros (didn\u2019t like to get the tinny sound in my good ear, felt like I lost something), molds and regular domes, and a couple of different brands I think. Ultimately I ended up not using any. I didn\u2019t use them enough that I got used to them, I function well at home and in one to one situations so using the aids there was just exhausting. I found I was very sensitive to sounds, especially while wearing the hearing aids. Cutlery or glasses being put down for example. And in noisy situation the aids didn\u2019t really help much, they amplified sound but didn\u2019t help any with word recognition. So the ends result was that I used more energy with the hearing aids than without. \n\nI was never shown my audiogram or explained how much hearing I have left, but in my daily life I\u2019m completely deaf on the right side. With a hearing aid I could hear sounds (wow was that a special experience the first time) but no word/speech recognition. \nSurgery (Baha/CI) has never been mentioned with a word, so I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s an option. \n\nI\u2019m gonna ask the hospital for my papers, then at least hopefully I can read and get some more knowledge. \nInformation is always helpful, right? \ud83d\ude0a", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2944, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Going on 5 years with my dead ear, looking for information.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/r1h52l/going_on_5_years_with_my_dead_ear_looking_for/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "GoinBack2Jakku", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_321b40r7", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1637758113, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/r14gjp/one_of_my_biggest_ssd_peeves/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r14gjp", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 19, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/r14gjp/one_of_my_biggest_ssd_peeves/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1637758123, "score": 1, "selftext": "Complete SSD from viral nerve damage at age 10.

Was put on steroids and diuretics for 2 weeks and it recovered a lot, more or less back to normal. 2 days after finishing the steroids the hearing has gone again and the tinnitus is back. I've been to 3 NHS doctors, A&amp;E, 1 Private ENT and I still have 0 answers. Does anyone have any idea of what could be wrong with me? My ear is completely clean, no wax, no redness, no seepage when viewed by the doctors so I keep being told I don't have an ear infection. How far into the ear can they see? Is it possible I have a virus or infection deep into the ear? Would an MRI be likely to reveal anything - for example swelling? Or something worse/more sinister? I've been told by my NHS doctor that I won't be seen by another ENT for another 2 weeks so it'll be at least 2 weeks until I can get an MRI unless I go private (but it's really expensive and I can't afford it).

with my left hearing (although that one is already fine), the day after that I felt dizzy, vomiting and I could not get up, a doctor had to come home because I could not even stop,  at first I thought it was because of the left hear all that, already at night the vomits had already stopped and the dizziness was little, I thought that everything would be fine and tomorrow, but the right hear followed the tinnitus and felt that I did not hear anything, it was a couple of days later that I went to consult a specialist in the city and asked me for some studies,  but the studies where I live only had an appointment in 2 weeks, so yesterday, together with my parents we went to another city to do the studies, and they recommended another specialist there, and he told me that we have to start the treatment now and told us that the ideal would have been to start in the first 72 hours since the discomfort began.\n\nThe specialist already recommended some pills and today he is going to inject me, he was honest with me and told me that he was not sure that I can recover the right hearing, but that anyway we have to try, my question is, there is some similar case here that his treatment began 2 weeks after the problem began and he was able to recover even a little hearing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now there is only the tinnitus although mild, if I am concentrated it is

attract back in September of 2015, received the processor shortly after. After being SSD for 39 years I was excited to finally experience hearing more than I had before. Hearing in my good ear is flawless according to my ENTs, that I was a great candidate.\n\nHow crestfallen I was when it did not deliver.\n\nThe sound quality is so poor, it's volume output is no where near satisfactory. I've had multiple adjustments and even by a rep' from Cochlear. Downgraded to a BAHA 4 in attempt to salvage a solution and it's still a terrible experience.\n\nI will concede that someone with more profound hearing loss could get benefit from this device. But I think even then they are getting the short end of the stick as this product vastly under-performs.\n\nNot only is the sound quality and volume miserable. The ergonomics, construction and operation are equally infuriating.\n\nFeels cheaply constructed, not nearly robust enough. \n\nThe lack of physical controls on the BAHA 5 is frustrating, since the processor feedbacks wildly in some noisy environments there's no quick way to mute it. You have to pull out your phone, pray the bluetooth connection to your phone is still working (which is the worst part of the whole thing), open an app and then you can mute/adjust volume. Least the 4 had some volume buttons on the device. It's so much quicker, easier and socially less awkward to just press a button the processor than fumble with a phone, fidgeting to get it paired with the phone and navigating to get to the app and then the app itself. Nor do I think having to buy the overpriced phone remote is a desirable solution knowing that the BAHA 4 could accommodate buttons without adding significant mass to the processor. BlueTooth as a solution for the hearing impaired to make phone calls is fine, using it as the only means of manipulating it's features is a mistake.\n\nThe battery door on the 5 is the only way to turn the processor off. Which is poorly designed and constructed, breaks easily and isn't a user replaceable part!  Despite how easy it is to remove, despite that in the user guide it illustrates to the user how to remove it to replace with a tamper proof battery door, Cochlear will not sell you the door separately. Forcing you to mail it off for repairs, which is neither convenient, fast or economical.\n\nTho my biggest complaint is the sound. It's no where near loud enough to perceive any benefit. I constantly plug my good ear to strain to tell if it's even working. The effective range that sound is present without straining is only about 1-2 feet, any thing else is so faint that's not worth it trying to make it out. The sound is muffled, low and electronic sounding. Makes it harder to decipher speech with the BAHA than without!\n\nI hate to rant on and on like this as I truly wanted this to be a life changing experience for the better. Alas it's left me embittered and disenfranchised. So much so I elected to return both the BAHA 5 and the BAHA 4 to Cochlear and wash my hands of the whole experience.\n\nTho I haven't given up on the concept. I can't afford to try another companies offering and since the magnetic implant isn't necessarily compatible with the competition's products. I've been slowly working on making my own BAHA processor. I've got some working prototypes I've fabricated at home with a 3D printer and some bone conducting transducers I've bought off the net. I think I'm getting close to something that's loud and clear enough to be of benefit to me.\n\nMostly, this is a post warning for those prospecting if they should/shouldn't get a BAHA for single sided deafness. There are plenty of great success stories out there, there are certainly stories of failure (this one included) as well. Cochlear as a company is very adept at saturating the whole internet with their marketing and sponsored information. It's hard to find un-biased information about the success/failure of the product.\n\nIt was a very expensive experiment and one I feel rather ripped off about with what I got from the experience.\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cochlear BAHA for SSD = Epic fail", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/47v2rw/cochlear_baha_for_ssd_epic_fail/"}, {"author": "gruffi", "author_created_utc": 1354020670, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_9q52w", "created_utc": 1456567277, "domain": "imgur.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/47ub35/for_those_who_listen_to_music_on_samsung_phones/", "gilded": 0, "id": "47ub35", "is_self": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/47ub35/for_those_who_listen_to_music_on_samsung_phones/", "post_hint": "link", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "t2rcVRsjk_SvbYjaH5Icg7C77YBwEH0xQzZb_L1keTI", "resolutions": [{"height": 192, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/aY7MS4RmaAe5amj6d3n_AMW5u7PyJlo6wnsZmsicd5g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=4d6f41f81f801571016cdf4c33e026cd", "width": 108}, {"height": 384, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/aY7MS4RmaAe5amj6d3n_AMW5u7PyJlo6wnsZmsicd5g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=0707d7e80601dddc7b5c5266f31fc46e", "width": 216}, {"height": 568, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/aY7MS4RmaAe5amj6d3n_AMW5u7PyJlo6wnsZmsicd5g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=8fbf9ddb3e491c1d30a9ddcb24a9cc33", "width": 320}, {"height": 1137, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/aY7MS4RmaAe5amj6d3n_AMW5u7PyJlo6wnsZmsicd5g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=26e6d8332c5816ef6290bf0ea34e3ed5", "width": 640}, {"height": 1706, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/aY7MS4RmaAe5amj6d3n_AMW5u7PyJlo6wnsZmsicd5g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=1bb062eafceddf3565695a0293e7618c", "width": 960}, {"height": 1920, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/aY7MS4RmaAe5amj6d3n_AMW5u7PyJlo6wnsZmsicd5g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=56f0b136ae2607f6c6a6e5553a1ae56e", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 1920, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/aY7MS4RmaAe5amj6d3n_AMW5u7PyJlo6wnsZmsicd5g.jpg?s=550c8bf9269647b52d336615b85a90af", "width": 1080}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1459220529, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "thumbnail": "http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/h3yCSq24fSFmzcTJKMZahSPcEtMdQJb_PuXQyPwbWsA.jpg", "title": "For those who listen to music on Samsung phones", "url": "http://imgur.com/KkvqnEX"}, {"author": "oldforger", "author_created_utc": 1360894439, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_alssb", "created_utc": 1456563085, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/47u4qg/would_there_be_interest_in_earrings_with_the_mute/", "gilded": 0, "id": "47u4qg", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 10, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/47u4qg/would_there_be_interest_in_earrings_with_the_mute/", "retrieved_on": 1459220446, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I have a friend who's a goldsmith I'm chatting with about this.

I was lifting weights in the gym, which is one of my biggest hobbies/passions.  I knew proper form and had been doing it for a long time.  However, I pushed it too hard that day.  In the gym, I felt a bit strange and upon leaving, I remember talking on the phone and my ears felt clogged, which was rare.  That night, I tried \"blowing out\" the clog feeling.  Woke up in the middle of the night and immediately knew something was horribly wrong, as the world was spinning uncontrollably.\n\n\nI threw up a bunch and couldn't even stand.  Luckily, Harvard's hospital (Charles MGH) was 2 streets over from my apartment.  The girlfriend had to drive me.  The docs didn't know what was wrong.  They held me overnight and assumed it was viral labrythitis (a virus attacks your inner ear), and that my hearing would come back 1-2 weeks.\n\n\nAfter 1.5 weeks, there was no progress, and the ringing continued.  I hated it and was in fear.  I ended up seeing about 7 doctors at MIT and Harvard.  They, of course, had no way of knowing exactly what went wrong, just that it falls within the umbrella SSNHL, and most likely I tore a hole in my oval or round window (perilymph fistula).\n\nI saw world-renowned expert Steven Rauch, who in addition to my having already received prednisone, he gave me the option of receiving steroids in the ear drum.  On the spot, I had to decide.  I didn't want to regret not trying everything.  So, he gave 4 injections over the next 2 weeks.  No improvement.\n\nOn my 26th birthday, I opted to have exploratory surgery (via Steven Rauch, too), just to see if there was still a tear, and if so, they could patch it to prevent any further damage/dizziness?  No hole was found, but that doesn't mean one wasn't there, as the body tries to repair itself.\n\nI'm 31 now.  At first, I only told a few close friends and held it as a deep secret.  I viewed it as a handicap but told myself it's only a handicap as much as I let it be; hence, why I didn't want to advertise it to anyone.  I wanted my life to continue and to try to get by without making it an issue.  I wanted to see if everything could be the same.  Turns out, it only made very few situations difficult:\n\n* hearing people within loud, busy places like cafeterias or subways\n* people immediately to my left\n* locating noises\n\nNow, I'm much less shy about mentioning it, just only if it warrants mentioning do I bring it up.  Or, each girl I date, if we're a few dates in, I like to mention it as part of the progression of intimacy.  \n\nI am very curious to hear it happened to everyone else, and what their story is!\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "When and how did you lose your hearing?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/47sg0k/when_and_how_did_you_lose_your_hearing/"}, {"author": "NillaCookie", "author_created_utc": 1404775630, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_hapog", "created_utc": 1456529874, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "edited": 1456545264, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/47s82d/i_just_want_to_say_i_am_happy/", "gilded": 0, "id": "47s82d", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 25, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/47s82d/i_just_want_to_say_i_am_happy/", "retrieved_on": 1459219556, "score": 16, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "To know that I am not alone.

I love y'all \"kindred ears\" already!  \n\nHi! I'm 52, female, and lost my left ear hearing 3 yrs ago to an inner ear infection. Imagine a good many of you know what I'm talking about. Horrible dizziness for 2 weeks, sudden loss of hearing in the effected ear, replaced by REALLY LOUD tinnitus. (Which thankfully has gradually decreased over time. I only really hear it at night when all is quiet. And it's a constant drone, so I can sleep thru it.)\n\nDrs at urgent care (in S. Missouri) gave me antibiotics, patted me on the head, said, \"Hope your hearing comes back!\" and sent me on my way. Clueless idiots!\n\nToo late, I learned I should have been given steroids. My hearing could have been saved if somebody had known enough to give me a simple prednisone prescription. Ugh!\n\nSoon found myself in the audiology department of my local hospital, getting CROS aids. WOW they work so well!! I love how well they work!\n\nBut I can't wear them. They're absolutely excruciatingly uncomfortable. I use the Phonak Audeo with the little \"badminton birdies\" that go into the ear canal. Those things drive me batty! They itch/tickle/hurt. I've tried all sizes, I've tried those lubricating drops. I figured out they feel better if they can't move around too much, and/or if they can slide a bit more freely when I talk, chew, etc. The lubey stuff does help. But not enough. I watched a Youtube video in which a lady said, \"I don't even know I'm wearing them.\" I'm SO JEALOUS! \n\nConsequently, I only wear my aids when I know I'll really need them, like in a big, echo-y classroom. They help sooo much but they drive me nuts! So most of the time I just \"what?\" people to death, and miss a lot. \n\nMy audiologist told me the \"badminton birdies\" were necessary for sound and air to get through, as I do have a bit of hearing in my bad ear, and pretty good hearing in my good ear. But I wonder if I might be more comfortable if I got custom molds. Do they make those with holes in them so air and sound can get through?\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has any ideas that might help me wear the HECK out of my wonderful (pricey!) aids, instead of just leaving them in the drawer where they do me no good at all... ?\n\nThanks in advance for any ideas.

When I was young in the 80s, my parents discussed the issue of reconstructive plastic surgery with me and we talked to a specialist. I did not choose surgery. A few reasons:\n\n1. The result would have looked uncanny. Back in the 80s, those versions did not look too realistic, even though they would have been constructed from my own bone and tissue. Which brings me to \n2. for something that didn't look the part exactly, the procedure was lengthy and fraught with potential complications and pain. They would have harvested cartilage from the ribcage and skin from somewhere else and used that to create the new ear. It would have taken several surgeries and weeks to months.\n3. I was very stubborn about wanting to be accepted the way I am. I am still not sure if that is clever or incredibly dumb. Even though other schoolkids sometimes made fun of me, I was not willing to give them a \"win\" by changing my appearance because of it.\n4. My inner ear is only partly damaged, even though I hear nothing on the right, and there was a chance that surgery would  change the way I hear, but no one could tell me if it would be for the better, of it would just add \"noise\" or if it would affect my sense of balance (which is of course one of the functions of the inner ear). There was not enough expertise to reconstruct the rest of the ear in a way that would have worked together with the inner ear that was still there.\n\nToday, things are a bit different, but I never came as close to the point of decisionmaking as I had back then. I've seem some impressive synthetic replicas that can easily be attached and detached and changed. Sometimes I still think about it. I'm sure some situations in life would go more smoothly, but I feel people are mocking me now for other reasons, so, yeah. ;) I still consider my damaged outer ear a part of me, and the idea to have it removed to be exchanged with something synthetic or organic still seems... odd.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I should have, or if I still should.

I have submitted information to them that includes similar plans with hearing aids exclusions under Aetna and Medicare that classify the BAHA as a prosthetic instead of a hearing aid.  The response was that because \u201cBAHA\u201d had hearing aid in the acronym, it would always be classified as a hearing aid.  Almost as a joke I mentioned \u201cthen you\u2019d have no trouble approving the PONTO?\u201d  They asked for my doc to submit a pre-auth for the PONTO.  \n\nMy doc stated they wouldn\u2019t approve the PONTO either.  I finally handed my insurance  them a well written and researched appeal, but they reached out and said they cannot process my appeal because they never got the pre-auth for the PONTO.  \n\nBack to my doc,   Nurse (very irritated with me after months of back and fourth) states they are they same CPT codes and they will not submit a pre-auth because it is the exact same codes as the one that was already denied.    \n\nI have spent 8 months back and forth between my insurance and doctor and I\u2019m nearing the end of my rope here.   I have the feeling the doc is done engaging with me on this and insurance keeps putting out one roadblock after the other to stop/stall the process.\n\nHas anybody had a similar story?  Any success stories with insurance plans that have hearing aid exclusions and how did you win?\n\nAlso, if anybody Happens to know of a good doctor in the Boise, ID or Tri-Cities, WA area that had staff that really advocated for the patient in this process I\u2019d love to hear about it, working with my current nurse feels like pulling teeth.  Hate to start the process over, but it feels like the right resource could go a long way here.\n\nThanks for hearing me out!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1584, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Insurance approval for BAHA woes", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/ernjuy/insurance_approval_for_baha_woes/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "naturalhorror_", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5d8zezm7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578132251, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/ejuw64/should_i_identify_as_hoh_or_hearing_within_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejuw64", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/ejuw64/should_i_identify_as_hoh_or_hearing_within_the/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "automod_filtered", "retrieved_on": 1578181665, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1557, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Should I identify as HoH or hearing within the Deaf community?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/ejuw64/should_i_identify_as_hoh_or_hearing_within_the/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "brownr81", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_49fqe8uy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577997481, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/ej3vjw/surround_sounddolby_atmos/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ej3vjw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/ej3vjw/surround_sounddolby_atmos/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578081052, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hi all anyone gots any thoughts regarding homesurround sound systems especially Dolby  atmos.

I had a cold at the time so I figured it would eventually go away on it's own. After about 2 weeks I went to the doctor and he said it was probably just allergies and to take antihistamines. After 6 months the hearing loss was much worse and I have very bad tinnitus and vertigo. My doctor sent me to an ENT who said my ear looked fine, and I probably just had hearing loss from listening to loud music and there was nothing to be done about it. I was pretty upset because I was only 20 and the hearing loss made it difficult to do my job or interact socially. A few months later I was thrilled when my hearing started to improve and the vertigo and tinnitus went away. The hearing never came back fully, but probably 80 percent better. But about a year later it happened again, and lasted another few months. I went to see a different ENT who did another hearing test, and told me again it was just hearing loss, probably from a virus that damaged a nerve in my ear. When I told him it had happened before and got better, he didn't seem to believe me and that it was unlikely to improve. It got better for a few months, but then came back.  This went in for years, seeing ENT's occasionally who never seemed to take it seriously. About 3 years ago I went to a new doctor who said I had severe hearing loss in my left ear and sent me for a CT scan. The CT scan came back normal and he told me it's just hearing loss and I would get used to it. It went away for about 8 months and things were great, but came back a few days ago and I have been stuck in bed with severe vertigo for 3 days. I know that hearing loss does happen and people adapt, but since it keeps coming and going, I wonder if it isn't just simple hearing loss and if there is something I could do to improve it. I feel stupid whining about it because people have it much worse, but I feel like I was never able to explain how much it affects me to doctors, or to get them to take it seriously. I already have problems with depression, and the hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo makes it so much worse. It's hard to make plans if I don't know how dizzy I'll be that day, and being dizzy makes me extremely anxious. I have a hard time sleeping because my ear is ringing so loud.

I had a cold at the time so I figured it would eventually go away on it&amp;#39;s own. After about 2 weeks I went to the doctor and he said it was probably just allergies and to take antihistamines. After 6 months the hearing loss was much worse and I have very bad tinnitus and vertigo. My doctor sent me to an ENT who said my ear looked fine, and I probably just had hearing loss from listening to loud music and there was nothing to be done about it. I was pretty upset because I was only 20 and the hearing loss made it difficult to do my job or interact socially. A few months later I was thrilled when my hearing started to improve and the vertigo and tinnitus went away. The hearing never came back fully, but probably 80 percent better. But about a year later it happened again, and lasted another few months. I went to see a different ENT who did another hearing test, and told me again it was just hearing loss, probably from a virus that damaged a nerve in my ear. When I told him it had happened before and got better, he didn&amp;#39;t seem to believe me and that it was unlikely to improve. It got better for a few months, but then came back.  This went in for years, seeing ENT&amp;#39;s occasionally who never seemed to take it seriously. About 3 years ago I went to a new doctor who said I had severe hearing loss in my left ear and sent me for a CT scan. The CT scan came back normal and he told me it&amp;#39;s just hearing loss and I would get used to it. It went away for about 8 months and things were great, but came back a few days ago and I have been stuck in bed with severe vertigo for 3 days. I know that hearing loss does happen and people adapt, but since it keeps coming and going, I wonder if it isn&amp;#39;t just simple hearing loss and if there is something I could do to improve it. I feel stupid whining about it because people have it much worse, but I feel like I was never able to explain how much it affects me to doctors, or to get them to take it seriously. I already have problems with depression, and the hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo makes it so much worse. It&amp;#39;s hard to make plans if I don&amp;#39;t know how dizzy I&amp;#39;ll be that day, and being dizzy makes me extremely anxious. I have a hard time sleeping because my ear is ringing so loud.  I don&amp;#39;t like to be around people when my hearing is bad because I feel like I&amp;#39;m not part of the group, and other people get annoyed that I keep asking them to repeat themselves. People think I am rude because I &amp;quot;ignore&amp;quot; them, but I really just didn&amp;#39;t hear them.

I have had these on for a couple of hours and the batter still is going strong - it is USB charged. \n\nYou can also play music through these but they sound is not high fidelity but not bad. You hear  the music and some ambient sounds. They are nice and comfortable, too. I bought these used because it was my first go at this and I did not want to destroy a new one.

Doc prescribed me 60mg oral prednisone which I take immediately\n\nTuesday - got a second opinion with another ENT. He said it couldn\u2019t hurt to do the intratympanic shot. So I did. Went to bed that night and woke up the next morning with no hearing in my left ear\n\nWednesday - went to a third ENT to get another opinion. Said reduced hearing loss might be due to fluid buildup from the shot, or it might be due to the hearing loss just taking its course\n\nThursday (today) - got another hearing test and report profound hearing loss in left ear. The audiologist said he\u2019s never seen it so bad and especially not after starting steroid treatment!\n\nTomorrow I have a consultation with HBOT and another follow up with the doctor who gave me the first shot. I\u2019m apprehensive of getting more shots now, and the other ENTs seem to think I should not get more until after the oral treatment is complete.\n\nAnyways, that\u2019s my story so far.

This is totally just a ramble, feel free to ignore: \n\nThe other day at work I had an older lady get mad at me for not hearing her question the first time she asked (I work in retail). I stood up for myself, but it was a frustrating experience nonetheless, and I was happy to find this subreddit. Since I've had SSD since birth (for unknown reasons possibly relating to a diaphragmatic hernia at birth), I don't know what it's like to be fully hearing, thus I'm not always aware of the implications until someone points it out to me. \n\nAs an adult, I'm now increasingly  confronted with how my reality differs from folks who can hear in both ears, especially since finding this subreddit with folks sharing their experiences just recently losing their hearing in one ear. \n\nIt's pretty sweet to have a little community via the internet ether to find comradery about. SSD doesn't bother me most of the time (except in the case of trying to locate a ringing phone or being in crowded spaces or sitting in the passenger seat of a car...lol). I tried hearing aids once but didn't like them, and never took advantage of any disability resources because I consider(ed) myself to be functional without it. But I've recently become a little more frustrated about some aspects of my SSD so this subreddit helps to know it's not just me. It's strange to come to terms with some of that \"loss\" a little later in my life considering I've had this disability forever. \n\nDo any other people who have been deaf all/most of their life feel similarly?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1383, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "23 yr old with profound SSD since birth ramble", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572106959, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/dj1i99/23_yr_old_with_profound_ssd_since_birth_ramble/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lamby_07", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_19ox5jxf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571206134, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/dil3q8/ssd_in_right_ear_not_sure_if_just_need_to_suck_it/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dil3q8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/dil3q8/ssd_in_right_ear_not_sure_if_just_need_to_suck_it/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571206134, "score": 18, "selftext": "Hello there, first time poster, longish time lurker. Sorry if this is a bit of a rant just got to a point where I feel frustrated with myself and I\u2019m struggling. I was diagnosed with SSD in my right ear after what the doctors think was a complication from an illness. I was really sick for months and then one day lost my hearing completely, luckily my doctor put me on some other medication and I was able to get a little back (I\u2019m classed as severe not profound) I can hear sounds in my right ear but put me in a room with more than 1 person and I can\u2019t understand what your saying. At the time I was told due to my age I should be able to \u2018cope\u2019 or adapt as the loss (first dr) but turns out I was not able to and recently organised an Aid (2nd doc helped) which is helping but naturally still getting used to it. I\u2019ve sought some psychological advice as it\u2019s really impacted my mental health as I am not able to perform at work at the level I feel I was able to do so, I was angry at myself I couldn\u2019t cope and it\u2019s really shit having to ask people to repeat themselves all the time (you quickly figure out who really cares about you hey)\n\nI\u2019m currently working in a large open plan area and I\u2019m finding that when the speaking noise in the office gets loud I get these really bad headaches. Anyone who has a loud cackle can give my instant migraine and I get dizzy/spacey and a horrible pain that goes down the neck. I know this is likely contributed to turning my head a lot to hear (still getting use to the aid/ I don\u2019t really like to wear it but if I have to I will) \n\nI also find with loud constant sounds I get really cognitively jumbled by the end of the day and feel like I\u2019m loosing my mind. \n\nIs this normal?! Does anyone else get this? Or do I need to suck it up and just plod along or book a back massage every once in a while to get the kinks out. Or maybe just not work in an open plan ?!

With the belt you have to remember to strap off to get up - believe me I forgot that a few times. The belt's advantage over the pillow is the vibes are felt more powerfully than the pillow's because you can move  the  belt around to where you feel the vibes best and it is directly on the skin. Also, for how I gameplay I like to lean into the game away from the back rest of the chair and the belt allows for that and and with the pillow I had to lean back - but that is just a personal quirk of mine. Sadly, if you hate wires all around you - this set-up has wires all around you!\n\nI stated this was built for those who are SSD but those who are fully deaf can find this very useful.

I find that my biggest challenge so far in my single sided deafness is not so much crowded work meetings etc (I seem to mitigate that by my seating) but walkin the streets/jogging/subway use. I am constantly being \"blindsided\" from my deaf side no matter how much I make it a point to remember I am single sided deaf now and I should pay attention. \n\nWhat I am playing with is to take amplified ear muffs like you see at shooting ranges or loud work environments and make them serve my needs. These headphones come Microphone on each side and while keeping the mic on each side I house the left and right drivers (aka the speakers) in one ear cup or convert the signal to mono so I at least hear something. If I hear something and look to me hearing side and see nothing then I quickly look to my deaf side - at least I would hear what is coming. So reworking something like this: https://www.amazon.com/Howard-Leight-Amplification-Electronic-R-01526/dp/B001T7QJ9O once I get something working I will ask for beta testers for it. I have to figure out if they be taken apart in the first place and be re-wired, etc - repurpose as much of their internals for re-use for this as possible.  It should be simple - keep mic in place but extend the wires to the driver so they go to the other ear. Can two speakers even fit in the same space? Can I cross wire (mono-short) left and right so that I just use the one driver in the working ear side?\n\nI have only been single sided deaf since 2018 so this may already exist out there but I have not found it other than these CROS/BiCROS/BAHA which seem something you need to see an audiologist for and are expensive. \n\nThe closest thing I seen that is like this is those hearing devices that look like 1980s walkmen liek this https://www.amazon.com/Elite-Package-Personal-Amplifier-Headphones/dp/B00V3MNIAI/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=hearing+helper&amp;qid=1569263612&amp;sr=8-8", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1345, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "DYI version of a CROS/BiCROS/BAHA Hearing Aid for street use?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569350476, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/d8aty1/dyi_version_of_a_crosbicrosbaha_hearing_aid_for/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Swarthy_Immigrant", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2zze68nb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569197011, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/d7yowb/2e1vibe_headphone_is_an_amazing_headphone_for_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d7yowb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_metadata": {"bn98xotpi8o31": {"status": "failed"}, "pydks4mrh8o31": {"status": "failed"}}, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/d7yowb/2e1vibe_headphone_is_an_amazing_headphone_for_the/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569197012, "score": 16, "selftext": "I beta tested the 2E1+Vibe headphone for /u/Biblos_Geek that is just an amazing headphone to me.

When I balance the vibe at about 25%-50% volume to match the volume level of my hearing side (each side has independent volume adjustment) I forget I am single sided deaf.

That means it is a headphone that has the 2E1 system for the working ear (left &amp; right drivers in one ear cup) and the deaf ear has an exciter. The way it works is that get a 3.5 mm Y split cable from your 3.5mm audio out source (be it from the computer or gaming console or TV)  and then you attach the 2E1's 3.5 mm male audio cable to the female Y input cable and the other end you connect a male to male 3.5mm cable to the other Y female out port and connect the other end of the male-male cable to a small amplifier for the exciter (which provides the vibration). The volume of the 2E1 side is controlled by the audio source like from the computer while the vibe side is controlled separately by the amp's volume control. This headphone is only  meant for those 100% deaf in one ear and with hearing in the other ear, though for someone who is 100% deaf in both ears they would have an exciter in each ear to vibe. Being an exciter it is vibrating to the sound because it is a speaker in waiting - it does not have a diagram and works by making what it is attached to vibrate to become a diagram - so it translates the sound to the vibe you feel at a 1 to 1 ratio. The currently available vibrating headphones which are sold now are just gimmicky and tend to have no corresponding connection to the what the viewer is watching vs what makes it vibrate.  I was communicating with someone who is 100% deaf in both ears and they had the same opinion on such vibrating headphones and he wrote me saying\" it was almost like the rumbling was random and not aligned to the real sounds that were going on in the screen.\"  \n\nOne of the things I was aiming at was to make something to sound waves to tactile vibrations so deaf wearer can even feel even soft dialogue as a vibration data on the ear. So one who was deaf  would be able to take conversations in a movie and while they can read  the closed captions they can feel the vibration of the talking so vibe effect is not limited to just special effects boom vibrations.  I also found there is a temptation is to turn up the volume on the vibe amp to make it intense - but I found  if I keep at the volume low on the amp to match the 2E1 side producing sound it kind of fools my brain into thinking the deaf ear is hearing into both ears (I am nerve deaf  it is not a bone conducting thing that I am experiencing). I am hearing both channels in stereo with one ear on the 2E1 side and the vibe on the deaf side is in sync with the music  because the exciter is using the same signal. My brain is fooled into  thinking like hey I remember this sensory experience! It's back! Also while i am gaming the vibe on one side only helps a lot.  The side that is deaf will vibrate if the sound is coming from the deaf side in a game and you hear the left and right sounds in your working ear. Example: If you hear footsteps on your working ear side but feel no vibe on the deaf side that means  the sound of the creeping footsteps is on the working ear side in the game. If you hear footsteps and feel the vibe on your deaf side  that means the footsteps are approaching from the deaf side in the game. I am working on a back rest pillow that would vibe left or right as well and that is ready for beta testing as well. \n\n[I made several of these 2E1+Vibe and handed them out to people kind enough to serve as beta testers and some wrote their reviews here - click this link (I encouraged them to tell all the good, bad and ugly).](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/cz0utx/vibrating_headphones_for_the_deaf_part_three/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img xgpjovxhinl31...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img wluwpxajinl31...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img xxgseuzinnl31...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img ojmhi8ssinl31...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 5xh7gozqinl31...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img kbtoevcwinl31...*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1322, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My 2E1+Vibe Headphone Build", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568159166, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/d1zauq/my_2e1vibe_headphone_build/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "cosmicpsycho91", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1vrzqcjd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567590925, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/cziq92/any_musicianssingerscomposers_out_there_deaf_in/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cziq92", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 36, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/cziq92/any_musicianssingerscomposers_out_there_deaf_in/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567590928, "score": 11, "selftext": "I recently saw an audiologist about some hearing difficulty in my left ear.

I usually pride myself in safety, but for some reason my brain was on auto pilot. My buddy got a new hand gun we wanted to shoot really bad (simple 9mm) but we didn\u2019t have anything for ear pro. I\u2019ve  been aware of hearing loss as I used to go to concerts a lot and got slight tinnitus from it so I just naturally associated hearing issues with loud music and prolonged exposure. For some dumb fucking reason I didn\u2019t realize heavy acute truama (such as fuckin gun fire explosions) wouldn\u2019t do as much damage. Even all my friends have said they\u2019ve let of round before without ear pro and we\u2019re fine. Well I was wrong and so were they Lol. I grabbed that little pussy cat and Let off like 5-7 rounds and I learned. Luckily I got off easy and mostly all of my hearing is back and in normal levels to get by in life and I got my hearing checked and all in normal range with slight left ear loss but still normally functioning. Still though I feel like I won myself a bit of a Darwin Award as my left ear is slightly more damaged than my right and the ringing is slightly worse there and there\u2019s that full feeling of like a cotton ball in there a little worse. So Go easy on me in the comments I know I done goofed. \n\nThe main question I have is can I get a single or 2 hearing aids to help chill out in dark quiet rooms and balance out that feeling of my ears being in equal with them. Can I listen to music with them? If I get one aid will it feel weird not having 2. Will a single aid help the tinnitus on one ear just by virtue of boosting the sound to help with the phantom hearing of tinnitus? \n\nI can live with how it is now but it would be awesome to do anything I can. And yes lesson learned\u2026 never will I let the blicky bark without ear pro again (unless I\u2019m in self defense situation in which case deaf seems better than dead)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2891, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Very mild hearing loss with tinnitus in one ear.

I had the abutment/post implant in August and had the BAHA 6 activated in September. \n\nThe Phone clip was my +1 and I was able to pair it with my work MacBook Pro, no problem. My issue is that whenever I get a notification on my phone or Mac, the audio cuts out for a few seconds. It's like when GPS cuts across music or audio book. The problem here is I miss out on a few seconds of work meetings, which doesn't sound like much but surprisingly, I can miss quite a bit. Since the MacBook audio is only the paired streaming or the main speakers, I can't hear the ambient sound with my \"good\" ear when the the audio cuts out.\n\nI basically stopped using the phone clip since my Android phone streams directly to my processor and Cochlear kindly exchanged my phone clip for the TV Streamer. I am happy with that for my TV and though maybe I could use it on the computer as well. Ah, thank you for nothing, Apple. I have two USB-c ports on the MacBook, no optical audio port and two dongles filling both.\n\nMy question:   \nHas anyone purchased an optical audio adapter and tried using your TV Streamer on your computer? The one I have found so far is not a multi-port dongle so that's a problem. Ideally, I'd like a dongle that has usb-c, HDMI, usb and optical audio ports but that might be the stuff of daydreams.\n\nTL:DR What do you use to pair your BAHA 6 to your MacBook Pro?

Declared oral steroids failed. - Day 15: Steroid injection conducted. - Improvement began within 24 hours.\n- Day 22/1 week post injection: Audiogram reading 50dB. \u201cModerate\u201d hearing loss. - Double-dose injection given. - Day 25: Audiogram reading 30dB at lowest frequency, 10dB at highest frequency. - Low frequency reading impacted also by tinnitus and expected \u201ctrauma\u201d to ear from injection and anticipated to recover as healing occurs. - Cause unknown.\n\nI hope anyone reading this has access to immediate care, is capable to be given the same course treatment and experiences the same outcome.

Ear feels \u201cmuffled\u201d - probably because there\u2019s a hole from the injection.

It started out as something viral a couple of weeks ago, then I had a \"weird feeling\" in my deaf ear and went to the doctor because I'm hypervigilant when it comes to ear stuff and amazingly it did turn out I had an ear infection. Took antibiotic drops for that and then both ears started feeling full followed by the usual congestion, face pain of a sinus infection etc..\n\nI'm on antibiotics now. Doctor said she could see both my ear drums were bulging like there was pressure behind them, but most worryingly in the last few days, I've been getting decreased hearing in my good ear. I didn't even realise at first until it popped and suddenly everything got louder. Now I listen out for specific background noises and that's how I can tell. It's very slightly muffled and while I can still hear conversation, tv etc.. there is a definite drop in detail. \n\nMy doctor wasn't too worried when I told her about the muffled hearing, but I'm sure I'm not the only one here who is terrified of losing hearing in their good ear. Has anyone had a situation like this before? Is there more that I can or should be doing? In my country we can't just go to an ENT, it basically all goes through your general doctor to refer you which takes weeks or the A&amp;E which I can't imagine would be too sympathetic.

It's difficult to describe, so if I don't do it well, please ask me for clarification.  Here goes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds coming in my hearing ear trigger a feeling/sensation of loud sound into my deaf ear.  If the sound is quiet, like a person speaking in a quiet room, typing on a keyboard, a cat meowing, etc.  the sensation/feeling will be small and light.  If the sound is loud, like a kettle, blender, motor, the sensation/feeling will be large, like the feeling of VERY loud rushing water or wind in my deaf ear.  Again, I don't HEAR anything in my deaf ear, just FEEL it.  \n\nHere's the really weird part!  If I plug my HEARING ear, quieting the source of the sound, my deaf ear will go \"quiet\", too, and will NOT have the reaction to the sound.  It is only through my hearing ear that my deaf ear receives this \"signal\".   Plugging my deaf ear does nothing, so it is not my deaf ear reacting.  It seems to be some sort of crossed signal in the auditory processing in the brain. \n\nThis happened when I became profoundly deaf in one ear, and has never gone away.  \n\nUsing my HA (which is maxxed out) does not make any difference, so increasing the sound volume directly to my deaf ear doesn't seem to work. \n\nAm I the only one?

Also sorry if this is long and more of a vent than anything else.\n\nI've always had moderate to severe congenital hearing loss in my left ear (which I'm recently finding out might actually be regarded as severe to profound according to a 2019 NICE update. This might make me eligible for a cochlear implant...).\n\nI was bullied for my hearing loss when I was younger and didn't have many friends. I found that the analog hearing aids of that time just made it more difficult for me to hear conversations and gave me bad migraines. Even with hearing aids, speech just sounds muffled. I would get in trouble with the teachers because I couldn't hear the lessons, and would more often than not come home crying and refuse to go back to school. This carried on into primary school, though it wasn't all bad. I began to deal with it a bit better as I got older.\n\nI wouldn't wear a hearing aid during secondary school, and just pretended I could hear normally. It created some problems with other people because of some misunderstandings. Understanding the teachers was also difficult, but at least it wasn't as bad as before.\n\nI got a digital hearing aid for university, and things generally went well. People would act rude about me not being able to hear them, even after I told them I was deaf, but lecturers were very supportive. It was support that I never really had before, which was nice.\n\nI'm undergoing my PGCE in teaching at the moment (a fourth university year) and I just find everything overwhelming and too difficult to deal with. I've been able to make a few friends in the past despite my hearing, and I've been able to function quite well and so I felt like I had things under control. But now I'm having trouble making friends with people on my course (I think they're all tired of me answering incorrectly or asking them to repeat themselves, so they don't want to hang out with me anymore outside of lectures), trying to understand both students and teachers in a school setting, and even simply *concentrating* when there's so many sounds. Covid-19 masks have just added to the difficulty because I can't even lip-read now. I just don't know what to do. I feel like a complete failure. If I can't even deal with this, how am I going to deal with a loud work environment? It just keeps reminding me of how I felt when I was bullied, and all the frustrations I had as a kid. It's like I've made no progress at all.\n\nI'm sorry if this reads off as self-pitying. I know I should generally be used to it by now. I feel like I'm making it a bigger deal out of it than I should be. Most people I talk to think I'm over-reacting or that my hearing loss is a sort of 'pretense' for attention, so I can't really vent about these things to them. I know unilateral hearing loss isn't as bad as bilateral, but I feel like my struggles have always been invalidated.\n\nI just feel really alone. I'm also embarrassed even talking about this, so there's a chance I might delete this post at some point. \n\nI really want to learn about other people's experiences though. I'm really hoping I'm not alone in feeling so horrible.\n\n**TLDR: Congenital SSD vent, finding it very difficult to deal with my hearing loss in new environment. Feel isolated. Feel like it's not taken seriously.

I've looked into hypnosis and meditation for tinnitus which both seem to be promising. Some studies have said that cochlear implants help tinnitus with single sided deafness. I really want to be reassuring and have potential options for him, but also not dismiss what he's going through at the moment.\n\nCan anyone give advice on what helped you deal with losing hearing in one ear and tinnitus? Has there been anything that's been especially beneficial in helping you adapt?

My PCP told me not to worry about it, but Google told me sudden hearing loss was serious, and not to delay treatment. I was able to get a same-day appointment with a local ENT. \n\nMy first audiogram pronounced me severely/profoundly deaf in my right ear. I couldn't even execute the speech discrimination portion with my bad ear. Even on the most extreme frequency, all I heard was a low rumble-- something resembling the Charlie Brown mom voice. My ENT calmly told me I had \"sudden sensorineural hearing loss\", most cases are idiopathic (no known cause), and that most success was tied to early treatment, but, due to the severity of my loss, it was unlikely for me to regain much hearing. \n\nFor someone in their mid-30s, in great health, with no prior knowledge that SSHL was \"even a thing\", the shock broke me. I cried almost nonstop for the next few hours, and couldn't focus on work or my family for a few days. I know all of you reading this know exactly how I felt. \n\nI was put on a tapering course of Prednisone:  \n3 days of (4)-20mg pills/day    \n3 days of (3)-20mg pills/day    \n3 days of (2)-20mg pills/day    \n3 days of (1)-20mg pills/day    \n\n\nMy ENT also called for an MRI to rule out tumors, and told me to come back in three weeks. We'd re-test my hearing and, at that point, discuss \"salvage therapy\", like intratympanic membrane injections, HBOT, etc. if I'd had no improvement and the MRI was clear. It sounded like that's what he expected to happen.  \n\nThe Prednisone was tough for me. I've never had side effects from a medication like I did with this one- lots of mood swings (though that might also have been the anxiety/stress/shock), terrible insomnia, constantly feeling parched, etc. all compounded with the tinnitus that never left me, and the struggles that come with not being able to filter noise or tell where sounds are coming from. \n\nDespite that, I noticed my first difference about 24 hours after starting the prescription. I felt some sort of \"pop\" in my bad ear while making dinner. The next morning, I could hear a sort of buzzing in my right ear that I assumed was related to cars passing me during my run. \n\nWith each day over that first week, my hearing seemed to come back a little more. That said, I think I preferred the complete deafness to the cacophony of tinnitus, partial, distorted hearing, and life with small children at home. I seemed to have struggles every night with the noises of children talking, silverware scraping plates, water pouring, feet kicking the table, and all the other ambient noise. A week after my diagnosis, I recall attending one kid's martial arts class. With all the yelling, noises, etc. I remember sitting there, trying desperately and futilely to plug my bad ear just to have some sort of peace. It was painful, and I hated the idea that I might never be able to comfortably support my kids in their activities.   \n\n\nDuring the second week, my hearing continued to improve, and the tinnitus started to ebb. I had moments where I thought it was gone completely, but never knew if that was just me being focused enough on something at work to not notice it. If I stopped and tried to listen for it, the tinnitus was usually there. But, I could also discern speech in my \"bad ear\". I could talk on the phone with my \"bad ear\". I could listen to music in headphones with both ears, even if the \"bad ear\" was a bit muffled and quieter than my good ear. \n\nI had my MRI during the second week. The original place my ENT referred me to was booked for months, so I opted for an independent radiology center that could get me in earlier. I had terrible tinnitus for about twelve hours after the MRI, and struggled to sleep that night because of it.\n\nThe tinnitus gradually declined over the next few days, leaving me cautiously optimistic about my hearing. By this point, I started to not notice my hearing loss in the bad ear, or the tinnitus. Around day 17, I started to think of myself as \"recovered\". While my hearing wasn't 100% in my bad ear, I could hear whispers, and that was \"good enough for me\". \n\nToday, I had my follow-up with my ENT. The audiogram was a stark difference from last time. I was able to complete everything they wanted to test. When my ENT was about to come into the exam room, I heard him ruffling through papers, and asking the audiologist if they'd put the correct audiogram in my file, because \"there's no way this is the same patient\".\n\nHe told me my hearing was normal, and that I was probably the luckiest patient he'd ever seen. He told me he had another case, a young man, similar (early 30s, sudden profound unilateral loss after a virus) who he'd also started on steroids within 48 hours, but who was in a week ago for his 3-week follow-up and had seen zero improvement. The doctor found my case absolutely miraculous, and I'm beyond grateful. \n\nMy heart aches for everyone who is still dealing with this, didn't see improvement from their treatment, and having to adjust to a new way of life, but I wanted to share my story in case it gives someone else hope. I know I didn't have much of that three weeks ago. It's beyond frustrating to not have any solid cause for why this happens and why recovery varies so much between people. This board has been an incredible resource for me, and I'm grateful for the support I've received in this community. I wish everyone could have the same experience as I did.   \n\n\n*Before (top) and After (bottom) Audiograms*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1fku72brdqq71.jpg?width=2160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08f525aaaf7ace3848f4b1eea77dee00e2a1603d\n\n *TLDR: I went from profoundly deaf in one ear back to \"normal hearing\" after a 20-day tapering course of Prednisone.*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2799, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Success Story: Oral Steroids", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/pywef5/success_story_oral_steroids/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Excessive_yogger", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1gx4zvxj", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1632872362, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/pxiwdl/has_anyone_had_to_pay_a_percentage_of_the_cost/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pxiwdl", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/pxiwdl/has_anyone_had_to_pay_a_percentage_of_the_cost/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1632872373, "score": 1, "selftext": "Well it looks like my insurance has me pay 5% of the cost of the Osia implant system and surgery.

everyone. So thankful for this community for your knowledge and support.  I am about 2.5 months out from when I developed labyrinthitis (vertigo, aural fullness, sudden hearing loss).I had profound hearing loss in my right ear at my first ENT visit on day 5 (flat line at the bottom of the audiogram; I could not hear anything). Since then, I have had high dose oral prednisone,  6 intratympanic steroid injections, acupuncture,  chiropractor visits, and 5 sessions of HBOT(2.0 ATA) at week 10. My vertigo has improved significantly and my vestibular system is functioning about 90%. My hearing improvement stopped at week 5. I have a downward sloping curve  where my low frequency is normal (15 dB) , middle frequency is about 40 dB, and high frequency is still profound loss at 85 dB. \n\nI need some advice and motivation.  \n\n1. RECRUITMENT. For those who have functional hearing in the affected ear, did you experience recruitment? It's so disturbing for me to hear myself talking at such a loud volume when I am only speaking in conversational level. How long does this recruitment process go on for? I'm hoping that it doesn't get worse over time and that I've already experienced all the changes. Anyone find an effective way to slow or halt this process?  Or how to manage it?

I'm a primary school teacher in Northern Ireland and I teacher year 2 (5 &amp; 6 year olds). Since this all happened 3 weeks ago I have been in work. It has been very difficult but I was thinking this was temporary (told wax, then congestion by medical professionals) so I just was trying to get through each day thinking it'll get better soon. As you can imagine it's a noisy environment. The kids (30 of them) do structured play in the classroom &amp; they are also chatty when working, art tasks, cut &amp; stick etc. Even when it's quiet time there is still always kids scrapping chair legs, chatting to their partner etc. It is also very difficult for me to know sometimes who is being disruptive so I can't nip it in the bud. The noise makes my tinnitus roar. Even talking to one person can make it flare up in my ear &amp; create pressure. I guess what Im hoping for here is that cause it's all so new it'll be difficult for a while and then get easier. Will ear defenders here be my best option (though I don't like sticking things in my ears, even more so now). Am I silly to be going into work tomorrow or is it a case of it'll still be difficult next week or the week after so I may as well get on with it.

( August 25th) He says my right ear has a healthy amount of earwax, but my left ear has no ear wax AT ALL. He performed a hearing test and the results indicated to SSHL, according to the doc. He was iffy about prescribing me an MRI but because I have one due for my pituitary tumor, he said I can just do it then. He let me go. Never mentioned steroids or any kind of treatment. I don't have trouble understanding words, even in loud environments. My sound was distorted but it is almost at normal levels. My clogging has improved. I do have mild tinnitus that started on Wednesday after he told me what the disease could be. I don't know what to do. I feel lost. Should I schedule another hearing exam?

The only strange thing that happened during dinner is that I was drinking a beer and it ended up coming out of my nose (and hurt). I felt kind of dizzy but I figured that I was having an anxiety attack (which I have a lot of lol) and the panic was causing the dizziness. I tried to remain calm and sleep on it because in the past I\u2019ve had sudden hearing loss and it turned out to be congestion/ETD, though I remember my ear being more crackly than it is now. My kineseologist who looked in my ear for the heck of it and saw it was red. Went to urgent care 5 days later and they said they saw fluid and redness but no infection, but refused to treat me because my blood pressure was high. Both of them looked very deep in. Went to an ENT the day after, who looked shallowly in my ear, didn\u2019t see fluid, and did one of those pressure tests which showed no fluid in the inner ear. He was afraid to give me steroids because of my HBP and instead gave me a zpack. I had also started experiencing an extremely sore throat and ear/tube pain, which the ZPack helped with, but did not help with the congestion/muffled hearing. I should also mention that prior to this, I frequently had my left nostril clogged, and occasionally it would switch to my right. Now my right nostril is clogged majority of the time, sometimes switching to my left. \nI had to get on a plane and use elevators for several days and my bad ear was horrible - it would take hours to pop, when it did, it got 80% feeling good but then would re-muffle within a few seconds. Even now where I\u2019ve been home for several days no changes of elevation, sometimes. Can\u2019t get it to pop.\n\nMy concern that it\u2019s SSHL is that 1. The sudden onset, 2.the fact it hasn\u2019t gone away for 2 weeks (though I wasn\u2019t able to take decongestants because of my HBP), and 3. When I do pop or crackle my ears, the muffled feeling doesn\u2019t 100% go away \nBased on what I\u2019ve described does it sound like SSHL or something congestion/ETD related? Is it possible I had a high blood pressure like that caused SSHL? If it does sound like it could be SSHL, how can I get officially checked? Also to clarify, it\u2019s not 100% hearing loss, it\u2019s definitely more so muffled hearing. It just sounds like my highs are muffled.

I take Campral to calm my brain, gabapentin at night to help me sleep, klonopin as needed when I can\u2019t escape the screeching in my brain or to help me sleep, and recently we added Adderall to help keep me focused during the day and make it so I am not so exhausted by the tinnitus that I put myself to bed at 7pm.

I try to eat healthy, drink a lot of water, exercise - I can\u2019t pinpoint what triggers my tinnitus to flare out of control.

I keep being told my brain will adjust to the hearing loss and stop making the ringing noise. When?!? I have my first large gathering on Monday since this happened. There\u2019ll be a DJ. I\u2019m already sure I won\u2019t be able to hear a thing people are saying to me, which is causing me majorly anxiety\u2026 but then i\u2019m also scared of the loud music. I guess this is a rant.

Although I've remained patient and optimistic and I wear the hearing aids consistently, I still can't hear very much sound from my right side.

I think the sound signal from the bad ear is getting lost because of the high volume of the aid in the good ear. What I want to try is to get my audiologist to set the hearing on my good ear to ONLY boost the sound and frequencies of the signals coming from my bad ear.

Post acoustic neuroma surgery the side of the face with the tumor was partly paralyzed. I had nerve graft to partially repair the damage but the area around my eye was and still is weak. I had a weight inserted into my upper eyelid to help it seat at night when sleeping t protect the eye. I also had plastic surgery to cinch up the eye lids so they can retain tears to prevent eye dryness -like creating a dam to retain moisture. \n\nOne of the post surgery symptoms for the verve damage for my eye is that they don't drain tears effectively so eye leaks a tear now and again. The bad thing is that it tends to gunk up the eye lash which can cause a [stye](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=stye) (I had one recently that needed to be drained).  The doctor will see if there are any surgical innovations to treat this drainage problem but I doubt based on what I recall the eye surgeon telling me. But who knows maybe something has been innovated in the last few years. \n\nIn the meantime I was given a prescription for an eye ointment that I need to put on every night on the eyelash to prevent gunk buildup. I will also initiate a new eye cleaning regiment since I was being delicate around the eye. I am posting this to help any one diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma learn from my experience. \n\nPS: I am posting this to help any one diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma learn from my experience.  If you were diagnosed with an AN and reading this please don't freak  out. I don't know if what I went through is typical or atypical.

He removed it along with some earwax above the hole he thought might have prevented the paper from sticking and put in a new paper.

It affects mostly the higher frequencies, some of which are completely missing, making it hard to follow speech especially in noisy environments. I've tried a number of conventional hearing aids, none of which helped me very much. I got to try the Ponto Superpower 3 on a headband for a while, with promising results, and recently got the abutment implanted. The abutment is Ponto, but is compatible with both Ponto and Cochlear's BAHA aids.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm fortunate enough to live in Norway, which means health care is basically free and I don't have to pay a penny for hearing aids. I can also choose which device to use, but the Ponto Superpower 4 isn't available here yet. I'm going to ask to try it when it is. I'm also waiting for acessories like an external microphone for the BAHA 6.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt works a *lot* better than with a headband, as expected. There's suddenly a lot more sound around me, which can be distracting and annoying sometimes, but I guess there's a learning curve training my brian to filter out what I don't need to hear. It's harder to know where sounds are coming from, which is probably both because my good ear picks up some of the sounds amplified by the hearing aid, and of course also because I'm just not used to the stereo perspective. There's always a faint background hiss when it's on, sort of like when you've recorded something with a less than professional microphone.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe sound does seem kind of thin or metallic-y, which surprises me given the stellar sound quality you can get these days with headphones and earbuds. So it doesn't seem to be very good for listening to music (I'm not a total audiophile, but I'll pay $300 for good headphones).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBackground noises like AC hum comes and goes a little, but for the most part this hearing aid seems to do a decent job at amplifying what I need to hear (I assume my audiologist can fine-tune it further). It's pretty useless in windy conditions, though it has an 'outdoors' program which dampens the noise quite a bit. Even walking fast indoors can cause significant noise. If someone is stacking plates or sorting cutlery in the same room I just have to turn it off, it's like someone is banging a gong two inches from my head.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe baha sticks out further from my head than I thought, so it's prone to getting caught and pulled off when I take off my sweater etc. Attaching and removing it is easy enough after a little practice. It's got one button to perform all functions, practically speaking I use it to cycle between the four programs (regular, noisy environment, music, and outdoors). In addition I can create my own profiles with the Android app. Volume control is only available through the app or with a dedicated remote I haven't got yet (unlike the Ponto which had a physical volume rocker). It looks okay. Pretty noticable since I have short hair, but I figure I'll see it as a conversation starter rather than an unwanted eye-catcher. Since it sticks out a bit it will inevitably come into touch with things (hats, hoods, pillows, loved ones) and it'll sound like someone is rubbing a finger along the inside of your skull. Nothing terrible, but it happens a lot more than with a regular hearing aid. By the way that also happens if something touches the abutment itself. It took a while to get used to the constant little noises when resting my previously practically deaf side on a pillow.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe app is a little slow, and it's a drag having to wait for it to start up when I need to change the volume quickly. A widget would be great, or maybe a newer phone would make it faster. It has a rudimentary equalizer (bass, mids and treble), but it would be great to have more options here, like more frequencies, types of noise reduction and so on.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's supposed to handle a little moisture like rain pretty well. My audiologist instructed me to open the battery hatch and letting it dry in case it gets wet, and it'll probably be fine. If not, Cochlear will repair it free of charge (not sure if this will be the case worldwide). It comes with an optional security strap.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll in all, so far I'm both impressed and a little disappointed with the sound quality. It helps for sure, but again it does sound a little thin. I'll post updates as I get more familiar with it and certainly when I get to compare it with a newer Ponto.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2518, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Baha 6 Max first impressions", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/mto0yo/baha_6_max_first_impressions/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lovemytrashtv", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4dgb9zdg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1618781543, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/mtm0bv/does_the_ear_making_electrical_noises_mean_my_ear/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mtm0bv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/mtm0bv/does_the_ear_making_electrical_noises_mean_my_ear/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1618781554, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2518, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does the ear making electrical noises mean my ear is getting better ?

Early in the morning on December 12th I started having an incredibly loud ringing in my right ear. About an hour later I lost total hearing. Went to urgent care and was referred to a specialist soon after. I was diagnosed with SSHL. The doctor explained that 1/3 have find no results from treatment, 1/3 has some and 1/3 has all functional hearing restored. For those of you who have experienced this know all too well the struggle and fear that comes with this challenge. Is there something wrong with me, what did I do to deserve this?\n\n I want to reassure you that you did nothing wrong and there is nothing wrong with you. \n\nI wasn\u2019t hopeful in getting any hearing back but after both two shots and a round of oral steroids I got back about 30% of my hearing. Still not great but definitely a better outcome than most receive. I accepted the loss and moved on with my life. \n\nIt\u2019s now been roughly 4 months since then and I\u2019ve continued to see improvement. I\u2019m up to around maybe 70% of my original hearing. I can now understand voices and speech and able to hear up to 5000Hz. \n\nI wanted to post my journey update not to congratulate myself but to give hope to those out there who both lost their hearing as well as any hope of returning to a normal life. I just want to encourage those who may feel down or discouraged that there is in fact hope. Some may experience what I am currently experiencing and some may not. But I believe it is important to both always have hope and accept the outcomes life gives us at times. My thoughts are with all of you that are going through this. \n\nGod bless", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2491, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hope for those out there", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/min1vg/hope_for_those_out_there/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ColeSloth", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4a5cm", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1617304384, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/mi2n7x/every_once_in_a_while_my_good_ear_will_pop_and_it/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mi2n7x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 24, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/mi2n7x/every_once_in_a_while_my_good_ear_will_pop_and_it/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1617304395, "score": 1, "selftext": "Wondering if this is normal or if my eustation tube isn't quite right and if it's something that can be fixed.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2489, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Every once in a while my good ear will \"pop\" and it seems like I have extra good hearing for just a little while.

In my case my deaf ear has a tinnitus like wooosh sound that I \"hear\" when it is quiet. Listening to something with my remaining ear so I can go t bed. These don't get too loud so it protects  my hearing. I am a side sleeper so this just goes under my ear but I can hear it resting next to my ear if I am resting head forward as well. I am working on sewing a cover for this like a mini pillow case that can be removed and washed. I sewed the [drivers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JBKB7YL/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_2?smid=A1YSFXBU9D6F1P&amp;psc=1) to an acoustic pad with, my sewing machine. My first (failed) attempt was to secure with hot glue - that is the residue you see on there. I am not offering this fort sale on my eBay store. If anyone is interested in one I think I can make it for $25 with the pillow case (I am hoping my sewing machine skills improve as I make more).  But anyone is free to make there own version for their use. What makes these different than what currently exists on the market is that they are separated  and when I was using as is they would drift apart and I would miss out on one part of the audio. In my case I am using Binary music to fall asleep to - think of new age white noise music used for meditating that plays a different sound per channel. For others getting any of these kind of pillow speakers playing audio in mono would do the trick.   don't know if there is a market for this but I found this solution worked for me. \n\n If you have any questions let me know. \n\nPS: what I abandoned for now is an attempt to secure these to my ear as I stated in my earlier post but I found  that leaving it on the pillow is good enough for me. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wihud0vg4op61.jpg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ef284c41d5415f144a07b9d3359c070bbeb8bac", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2484, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "2E1 stereo for single sided deaf pillow listening", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/merad8/2e1_stereo_for_single_sided_deaf_pillow_listening/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "No_Worth_9281", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5gnzpqed", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1615974656, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/m6wtzm/what_is_this_metallic_echo_hollow_in_my_head/", "gildings": {}, "id": "m6wtzm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/m6wtzm/what_is_this_metallic_echo_hollow_in_my_head/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1615974667, "score": 1, "selftext": "My bad ear behaves like an actual hollow in my head.

I got diagnosed on day 6, was not aware of the emergency and it happened right before a holiday weekend. I never felt dizziness and I never fully lost hearing, things just sounded muffled but peoples voices still sounded fine so I didn't register the emergency. Driving in a car, walking outside, all were totally normal, I only really noticed when I finally put headphones on in a quiet room how bad it was. I did have fullness and ringing but because it's mainly the lower frequencies, I thought it was getting better when it wasn't, it was just my environment changing. \n\nI've tried many things (two courses of 60mg prednisone, two steroid shots, vitamin B, vitamin D, 15 HBOT sessions at 2.0-2.4 atmospheres). I didn't know about constraint induced sound therapy when it could have helped but I would have tried that too. The ringing did lessen after starting HBOT but it could just be that I was at 4 weeks and the brain was getting used to it. I have a few more HBOT sessions left but I don't believe I'll be able to get more as there's been no improvement.\n\nSome unique things for me. I did have a bike accident 3 years ago (almost to the day) of the SSHL starting. Since the accident, I've been able to pop my jaw every so often (typically when I'm stressed) and the SSHL started when I was lying in bed on a Thursday night around 9pm and popped my jaw. It didn't feel any different and there was no pain but the muffled hearing immediately started happening right after. I know now I should have ran to the ER, but it is what it is. My ENTs don't think the jaw popping could cause it but seeing as how they don't know how to fix it either, it could be anything. MRI was also clean.\n\nI never tested positive for COVID but 48 hours before SSHL occurred, I did take the first shot of the Moderna vaccine. I had no major side effects and I highly doubt it is related to SSHL, but it is part of my history now. I haven't been able to get the second shot as I've been on steroids on and off ever since. \n\nYesterday I got my hearing aid, which has helped mainly will the feeling of fullness and ringing, not so much actual hearing.

Didn't really think to much more about it except for the annoying tinnitus that never went a way until a couple of months later I had a reoccurrence of the vertigo for about half an hour and then it went away. This happened a few more times so I went to my GP who referred me to ENT. The ENT was amazed I hadn't had any follow up appointments for the Labyrinthitis but I hadn't been registered when it happened and never thought to follow anything up!\n\nENT reffered me to the vestibular department and I had a session where they taught me some things to help with vertigo and detected a mild hearing loss in my left ear. (35dB at high and low frequency, 25 dB at middle frequencies). I'd kind of figured that out for myself but was managing fine so didn't want to try a hearing aid. I was also discharged as I hadn't had any more vertigo attacks for 6 months.\n\nIn October last year my tinnitus suddenly got really loud for a few days and then I noticed my hearing was definitely a bit worse.

I'm deaf in my left ear (as of last fall, thanks vestibular schwannoma!) and recently designed and had these pins made for myself after not being able to find anything similar online. I had to buy in bulk so I thought I would try to sell some and donate 20% of the proceeds to the Hearing Aid Project ([https://hearingaiddonations.org](https://hearingaiddonations.org)). \n\nSend me a message if you are interested in buying one. I do find they help - I can tell when people notice them and most seem to make an effort to speak louder. Even though I have a CROS hearing aid, I still think that it is helpful to remind people to speak a little louder than usual, especially in a noisier environment and in the age of face masks! \n\nThey're sort of heavy so you probably wouldn't want to pin it to your mask, but they are perfect for a jacket, bag or coat. I hope they can help some people out there hear better, and I think they're quite fun if I do say so myself.

I\u2019m 26 yo woman. In general I\u2019m ok - I only have Hashimotos but bo problem with tsh/ft levels. The only thing I suffer from is GAD and I take Zoloft for that (2+ years).\n\nI was totally well and I stayed mostly at home. One day, two months ago I started to feel dizzy while at home and I vomited. This quickly passed and I forgot. \n\nLater in December I did not hear for a day, one of my ears felt stuffed. It went away the next day so I assumed it was earwax or sth. After that nothing was wrong so I lived my life as usual.\n\nFast forward last two weeks, I was working on my computer when I had an awful vertigo. I needed to lay down and I went to sleep because the world was going crazy. In one of my eyes, a blood vessel was ruptured the next day. The day after that I lost hearing in my ear. I signed up to see a ENT two days later. He tested me and it turned out nothing was visiblly wrong with the ear - it was only deaf for no reason. I had an audiogram, it showed I was totally deaf in lower frequencies. \n\nI immedately went to ER. They tested me (heart, xray, negative covid) and prescribed me oral Prednisone, Serc, vitamines and some additional stuff for better blood circulation and hyperbaric therapy. \n\nI had MRI and it went out completly fine according to the radiologist. \n\nI took the meds + have attended the oxygen therapy for two weeks straight. Throughout the days my ear was better and worse. Sometimes I suffer from awful vertigo, maybe due to meds, idk. I feel like I had some kind of fluid in the ear. Sometimes when I get stressed and my muscles tense (my jaw especially at night - I clench my teeth, but my hospital ENT told me it cant be this....) start to feel as if the fluid was there again. Sometimes I wake up and everything is ok expect ringing in the ear.\n\nDoctors have no answers. I\u2019ve been to a neurologist, three ENTs and and a hospital. Everyone tells me to wait - for a month, maybe it will come back. I will end my hyperbaric therapy (15 meetings) and steroids next week. My yesterday\u2019s audiogram is as bad as the 1st one. \n\nThey told me this can be stress due to my anxiety but come on, I literally am chill now besides the ear. Also this serves as no explanation to me. \n\nI dont want to be deaf. Especially that I feel it gets better sometimes - like the fluid or the pressure or whatever goes away sometimes (im only slightly deaf then) and sometimes it goes back. When it goes back, I have a feeling like I have my head put against an invisible wall. I physically feel something is there (they tell me they see nothing).\n\nThey did not check my blood so I\u2019m planning to do it on my own - what should I check? What shall I do? What could this be? I had no viral infections in over a year or so. No bacterial infections as well. At least not that I could feel them.\n\nI\u2019m waiting to see one more expensive ENT and one more orthodontist (maybe it is the jaw? although my hospital ENT really laughed at me when I suggested it). I need to wait fear that each day gives me lesser and lesser chance of getting my hearing back.

I complained a little bit about loud rooms and echos and that the aids tend to make everything louder. She then hooked my hearing aids up with 5 programs: \n\n1. loud surrounding ( will focus the mic forward and reduce background noise)\n2. outside and sport ( wind noise reduction)\n3. walk with conversation (makes conversations clearer while reducing noice)\n4. Live music ( process the music to make it less flat)\n5.  room echo reduction. (same as 1 but will not focus the mic forward)\n\nCan switch between the programs in the app on my Iphone. (like seriously we live in the future, just imagine 20 years from now)\n\nI really have noting too complain about, I love these things, sure they could be even smaller but I wanted the batteries to last a full day and not have to worry about bringing the charger with me. \n\nAnyway these things have made my life so much better and to be honest I had some concerns about what people would say but I have had nothing but people being genuinely interested, asking how they work going omg I can barely see them.

I can't even hear it feedback (which apparently it is according to my wife).  So I've looked at what the alternatives are and it seems a BAHA is probably the only thing that is going to help.  For me, positional sound is important (at least it would be if I could hear it) for my work.

My right ear has had some loss, and I need a tweak to the aid anyway.\n\nI'm interested in anyone's BAHA experience, especially in regards to getting one, any connectivity features (like bluetooth to mobile phone).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1933, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Any UK SSD's here?

I also see parents who are devastated to learn that their child has hearing loss, and want to know what they can do to improve their child\u2019s chances of hearing again or having a normal life.\n\nI also know that there are many people for whom medical interventions aren\u2019t possible, or who are not seeking them.\n\nAbout me: I\u2019m 28F and lost all hearing in my R ear due to bacterial meningitis as an infant. So for me, I\u2019ve grown up with my SSD as a normal part of my life. I\u2019ve undergone intensive speech therapy as a child and now lead a relatively normal adult life, with a few behavioural quirks as a result of my deafness (cocking my head to listen to people, standing/sitting/walking in a certain position). My understanding is that I am not eligible for hearing aids as my loss is sensorineural, and I am ineligible for other interventions as my need is not great enough. That is, I function well without interventions so I\u2019m not medically considered a high priority candidate. I\u2019ve gotten used to this idea, and now hold the view that my deafness is not something that \u2018needs\u2019 to be fixed. I see society as overly preoccupied with \u2018fixing\u2019 disability, and overly preoccupied with the idea that people with disabilities are somehow broken and must lead empty lives as a result of their disabilities. I also slowly see society moving towards more socially inclusive models of operating. Often the first thing people ask me when they learn that I am deaf is why I don\u2019t use a hearing aid- I know that this is only from a place of concern, but it is indicative of a societal attitude that sees something inherently wrong with my deafness. So I try to educate them about why I don\u2019t see it as something that needs to be corrected or fixed. \n\n\nEnough about me... what are your thoughts and experiences?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1898, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What\u2019s your take on medical intervention?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/hjkauf/whats_your_take_on_medical_intervention/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "andrea9827173i", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4peamvpk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593608278, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/hj9o2u/mri_shows_my_cochlea_is_ossifying/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hj9o2u", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/hj9o2u/mri_shows_my_cochlea_is_ossifying/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1593608279, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just received my results and i am in shock.

No loud noises, no trauma, was just in the car, at a cross country meet, and back. Went to ENTs, got an MRI, everything came back negative (with the exception of about 60-70% loss in that ear) &amp; they called it idiopathic. Since that point, I've had constant tinnitus and (obviously) difficult hearing in loud environments. With earbuds in, I can hear muffled sounds and occasionally make out words if it's loud-ish. \n\nThe past week or so, I started noticing my right ear sounding kind of wonky. A little plugged, maybe, and a bit of tinnitus. Didn't think much of it the first couple hours, met up with some friends and noticed it was harder than usual to hear with ambient noise. I'm getting increasingly concerned over the next several days, so went to get an audiogram. They say my right ear is \"completely normal\", but my left has decreased a bit. That was yesterday, and particularly today it seems like my left tinnitus is much louder and noticeable than it historically has been. I'm thinking maybe something is causing that somehow, and that my brain is getting messed up and then translating the worse left tinnitus into wonky hearing on the right.\n\nMostly I'm curious if anyone else has been in a similar situation, and if so if there's anything you've done to make it even a little better.

Starting in 2019, my right ear would get full/plugged whenever I went running - yawning wouldn't clear it up and would have muffled hearing for about an hour after my run. I frequently now hear crunching noises from my jaw. Then, about 9 months ago I started noticing that I had a hard time understanding people talk with background noise present. Or, I have to now sometimes ask my spouse to enunciate their words as I can't understand what they are saying, lol. Lastly, within the last month I started feeling motion sick and nauseous and what I think is vertigo whenever I'd wear my headphones. Never happened before.\n\nGot my hearing tested and then diagnosed with asymmetric sloping to mild SNHL across a 3k frequency range - in my left ear! (Sloping toward moderate hearing loss at the end of the spectrum.) I'm due back for a visit to address the inner ear and motion sickness problems. Doc mentioned the possibility of a tumor causing this but we both don't think that is what is happening. Unrelated to this, but I'm also due to see a rheumatologist to rule out autoimmune problems that may be affecting my jaw. \n\nSo now what? Can the hearing loss be regained or is it lost forever? Can autoimmune issues cause this? Can I prevent it from worsening?\n\nThanks all, this is all new to me :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1890, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Noticed hearing and ear pressure changes within the past year.

I got assessed and back then no one knew why I was deaf, everything in my ear looked fine.\nNow, i never really did well at school in terms of listening and reading. I was great at maths and sciences. I always wondered why I couldn't read properly, though in my head I can read perfectly fine. It was interpreting brain to mouth where the words would come out different to what i was thinking.

incorrectly- I am not the most well-versed with Reddit and have struggled to find the best subreddit to post this on. \n\nI am a 26-year-old female in Atlanta with a Cochlear BAHA 5 implant/device. I had my implantation surgery at age 20 in 2014. \n\nDespite an initial \u201cfailed surgery\u201d at Emory due to a missing part of the implant needed for surgery, I had a second surgery that went perfectly with a different surgeon at Northside. \n\nI have had zero complications with the implant, having had both a BAHA 4 and a BAHA 5. At the end of the workday yesterday I noticed major swelling around my implant. I had not seen my ENT/BAHA surgeon in two years, having not been in frequent contact with my audiologist and ENT since graduating college. \n\nAfter noticing the swelling and discharge, I contacted the after-hours line for my surgeon. I left a message for her at the hospital as well as the ENT practice I had seen her at. The on-call physician at both facilities suggested I go to urgent care, get antibiotics, and a culture of the discharge. I am insured through Kaiser now and couldn\u2019t see my old doctor- so I went to a Kaiser advanced care facility (which operates 24/7 similarly to an ER). \n\nThey were concerned about the obvious infection and wanted to do imaging to see\nif the infection had reached my skull bone but were unfamiliar with BAHAs. They had to consult with an ENT to treat me and ultimately decided to forgo imaging and send me on my way with a strong oral antibiotic (Keflex), topical steroid (Clobetasol), and follow-up with a Kaiser ENT. \n\nI am hoping to get input from BAHA users who have had complications years after their initial surgery. Have you experienced recurrent or single-outbreak skin infections around your abutment? Have you had to see a doctor for swelling around the area? There is such little information available online aside from medical studies. I would really appreciate anyone with post-operative skin issues to weigh-in here. \n\nPeace &amp; love! - Cal", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1825, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "BAHA complication - 6 years post-surgery", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/grydjl/baha_complication_6_years_postsurgery/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "votewithyourmoney", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ovqsh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1590325149, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/gppajt/what_are_the_advantages_of_hearing_on_the_left_vs/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gppajt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 32, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/gppajt/what_are_the_advantages_of_hearing_on_the_left_vs/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1590325150, "score": 1, "selftext": "Alright, I'm a left-sider (good ear) and I've come here to argue. \n\nRight side advantages: \n\n  1.

Is it assumed that for SSD that hearing loss is so severe that a standard amplification hearing aid isn't powerful enough?\n\nAny experiences and comments appreciated thanks.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1814, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A question about hearing aids for SSHL", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/gn8vdp/a_question_about_hearing_aids_for_sshl/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "naujoaxiap1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ir0qo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1589916558, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/gmvfft/doubt_about_2e1_two_ears_in_one_in_gaming/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gmvfft", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/gmvfft/doubt_about_2e1_two_ears_in_one_in_gaming/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1589917607, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello, I always played a lot of games and not being able to \"hear\" directions\" really makes me feel bad on FPS Games, like CS:GO and now, Valorant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis Headphones could help me with it?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1811, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Doubt about 2E1 \"Two Ears in One\" in gaming", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/gmvfft/doubt_about_2e1_two_ears_in_one_in_gaming/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "BrickJedi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bqa8ywl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1589845095, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/gmd2qw/recurrent_sshl_in_right_ear/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gmd2qw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/gmd2qw/recurrent_sshl_in_right_ear/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1589845101, "score": 1, "selftext": "I had my first encounter with sudden hearing loss in my right ear 2 years, 8 months ago (September 2017).

So on April 8th (about a month ago) I had fullness in my left ear, as well as some pretty significant hearing loss and tinnitus. For two days I tried using earwax drops, since my ears commonly would get clogged with earwax. Then I saw a physician on the 10th. She said I had an ear infection and gave me ammoxcilin. \n.\nFast forward to about 2 weeks later, another doctor prescribes me Flonase. All while this was happening I was waiting 2 weeks before going to the Cleveland clinic because the ENT that I had a virtual visit with told me to wait.\n.\nFinally, on May 6th, I get a hearing test done as well as some earwax removed. Tests come back saying that I've lost about 60dB of hearing in the left ear, and I only guessed 28% of the words correct in the test where a man says some words. If it weren't for this quarantine I would have gotten this treated sooner. :( \n.\nAnyways, I got an injection of dexamethasone and then prescribed prednisone, 40mg for 3 days, then 30mg, then 20mg, then 10mg. I'm on my second day of prednisone and feeling a little discouraged, considering the research that I made on recovery rates. I finally started getting treated a month later, which makes me think I have low odds of any recovery.

I would be interested to see other people\u2019s experiences here if there are any.\n\nHere\u2019s mine:\n\nI woke up in the night, one and a half years ago, being violently sick, with major vertigo, after developing tinnitus the day before. I thought it was a bad sick bug at the start. \n\nThat morning I noticed I was completely deaf in my right ear, but at this time everyone in the house had all gone to work so I didn\u2019t worry too much about the hearing and just tried to get over my \u2018sick bug\u2019. Normally when I get a sick bug I\u2019m fine by mid day but every time I moved my head, I\u2019d be instantly sick with major vertigo. I then knew something was different, so I used a health assessment app (Ada) to see what I could be. \u201cLabyrinthitis, seek medical help immediately\u201d. At this point, aged 22, I\u2019d been luckily enough to never need to go to E&amp;A, the doctors or have any long term illnesses. I told my partner and she rushed home and we rang the UK\u2019s non-emergency health line and they suggested I get to E&amp;A right away, if she couldn\u2019t take me, an ambulance would have came and that would have been a first.\n\nAfter collapsing in the bedroom, on the stairs and throughout the house (still conscience) on the way out the door due to the vertigo, I made it to the car with a lot of help. The car journey was just as terrible too.\n\nWhen I got to E&amp;A 20 minutes later, a team I nurses were waiting and rushed me on to a bed, where they ran a lot of tests. Injection after injection, and a couple of drips later a doctor told me a had Labyrinthitis and that it\u2019d be back to normal in 2-3 weeks. Great, I just wait to wait get be fine again\n\nBed-bound for the next 3 weeks, I saw little recovery apart from the vertigo easing off. I was quite worried about my hearing. Still no improvement, so I went back to the surgery to ask. This then started a cycle of back and forth visits to nurses, surgeons, GPs and ENT specialists to figure out why my hearing had gone in the right ear, why I\u2019m still dizzy and why my tinnitus hasn\u2019t cleared. Each of the visits, over the next 7 months, I had a different answer, some saying I could get back to normal, some saying it\u2019s permanent. I had too many tests to remember, but they were scanning for tumours to giving blood tests for STIs checks, but I finally got an definitive closing answer late last year. \n\nI ended going to the world\u2019s leading vestibular clinic in Leicester, luckily not too far from where I live, and test after test again, they said I developed a bad case of Labyrinthitis causing permanent tinnitus, permanent hearing loss in the right ear of greater than 80% loss, and finally permanent balance loss of 60% in my right side.\n\nI\u2019ve fortunately coped really well and grateful for the close people in my life who put up with my many \u201cwhat did you say\u2019s\u201d a day, grateful for the healthcare professionals who helped and grateful to find this community recently. Worst thing for me is sound location, and sleeping I the bad side (causes vertigo).

Trying to find the beeping IV pole at work is a nuisance and I usually have to ask for help. Nothing earth shattering.

Just unlucky I guess. Anyone else have the same progression, SSD and then later developed ISSHL in your good ear? Did you recover any/all of your lost hearing?

While there has been some research surrounding the academic, social, and emotional impacts of hearing loss on children, I have found that it is lacking regarding those with a unilateral hearing loss. I believe this population is unique and that further research is needed to evolve the management of this specific hearing loss. \n\nI have created an online 20-question survey **for the parents of a child with the hearing loss mentioned above to complete**. The survey will only take approximately 5-10 minutes to fill out.\n\nRequirements to participate in this study:\n\n*\u00b7  Your child must be between the ages of 6 and 13 years.*\n\n*\u00b7  Your child must be enrolled in either elementary or middle school.*\n\n*\u00b7  The primary spoken language of your household is English.*\n\n*\u00b7  Your child has a diagnosed sensorineural hearing loss in which one ear hears normally, and the other is essentially deaf (known as single-sided deafness or unilateral hearing loss). If your child uses hearing aids or a cochlear implant, please note.*\n\n**If you are interested in participating, please click the link below to fill out the survey**:\n\n[https://utexas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_eG038Yvw6fvPIy1](https://utexas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eG038Yvw6fvPIy1)\n\nThis survey link will expire in one week. \n\nRegarding your privacy: \n\nThis survey is entirely voluntary.

Research records will not be released without consent unless required by law or court order. The data resulting from participation may be made available to other researchers in the future for research with no personal identifier provided.

It's been like this since birth really and throughout my childhood and teen years, until  now in my mid twenties, I've had to navigate this.\n\nIt's funny because I thought by the time I get to mid twenties,  I would have full understanding of how my mind and body acts with respect to my hearing loss and how I would navigate the world. But after being in the working world after about 2 and half years, it feels like there is so much to learn and I've felt quite stunned about everything.\n\nI've realised these few things:\n\n1. When someone asks me a question it takes a moment or two to process what they have said, understand it and then reply immediately:  Maybe this varies according to whether I know or don't know the person, but I realise it takes time for me. I'm scared that this may mean maybe my intelligence is below average. I don't want to sound uppity or stuck up or anything, but I know for sure that I do understand a lot of complex concepts and for me to grasp certain things I have  my way of studying it. In simple terms, I know I don't know everything but I know I'm not stupid or useless lol\ud83e\udd23\n\n2. Working in an open space, is hella difficult sometimes: Especially when it's busy, my word, my senses just act in overdrive, because I think my body kicks into that mode seeing as there is so much activity happening around me and so to protect myself I become hyper-aware. It is really tiring and frustrating sometimes. So when I come home....I cannot talk to anyone. I neeeed a moment or an hour to myself to relax and just tone down or something.   Plus travelling on the tube in London is just \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b.\n\n3. Selective hearing: I do this knowingly and unknowingly.  So sometimes I do it on purpose (it's bad i know  - I only do it with my mum because urgh she can be annoying). I realised I do it at work without noticing and it worries me a lot. \n\nOverall I'm pretty worried that this will affect my career prospects.  I want to go into management accounting but I'm worried that all this may hamper my prospects.  The funny thing is, i have done crazy stuff like door-to-door fundraising, speaking in front of 100 people - things like this in spite of my stuttering at times  lol\n\n\nSo what do you guys think?

It being the first time, I didn\u2019t know what it was and it was a Sunday. I bought some ear wax cleaner, but it didn\u2019t seem to work. I planned on calling the  doctor Monday morning. The next morning (Monday) I woke up and it was normal. I shrugged it off and went on with the day. \n\n\nBy that Friday I woke up again with hearing loss in that ear again. Immediately as soon as the ENT office opened I called. A hearing test later showed some low frequency loss, but I had no ringing or dizziness. After using prednisone for 2 weeks, a hearing test confirmed a recovery and I was back to normal. I asked the doctor what caused this and he said most cases we have no idea. \n\n\n\n\nFast forward a couple months to this past Thursday. I woke up once again with hearing loss. Unfortunately due to the COVID situation a lot of the ENT doctors in my area had been furloughed, including the one I saw last time. Eventually I was able to get ahold of him by phone and he told me to come in Friday (yesterday) for a hearing test, but he would not be there. I went in and got the test, but 24 hours later it turned out my hearing was back to normal. The nurse said the doctor probably wouldn\u2019t follow up quickly because the results were normal. I understood. \n\n\n\nHowever today I woke up again with hearing loss... less than 24 hours after I recovered again.

Will better receiver reduce background noise in quiet/loud enviroments and improve general speech recognition? \n\nBackstory: I have opportunity to buy starkey livio ai BiCROS system relatively cheap, but the downside of it - I won't really be able to test it. I would like to choose one of the following receivers: livio ai 1600 / livio ai 2000 / livio edge ai 2400. My plan is to buy the system and find good audiologist to personalize it for me - including REM fitting.\n\nI've been testing livio ai 1200 + cros, but even in an small office it wasn't easier to pick up on speech.  Without hearing aids I'd say it is rather quiet in the office - low volume music playing, silent AC running on. With hearing aids on, even using lowest volume settings, the background noise was really hard to bare and I feel like my speech recognition got even worse. In the office we are separated with computer screens - I can't really get visual cues. I suspect, that my audiologist didn't do a good job with programming devices. \n\nIn my area, it's really hard to find good hearing care professional, that has experience with treating SSD. I'm forming this hypothesis on my personal feelings that I've gotten observing my audiologist setting up devices. She was also genuinly amazed by the fact, that I can't localize sounds when my left ear is almost completly deaf. In my area, it is impossible to find a clinic, that performs REM fitting. I can't really travel freely to test all the options with a setup from a proper audiologist, so I just figured I should buy hearing aids cheaper and pay for a few fitting sessions with a proper audiologist.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2683, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is it worth to invest in better receiver using CROS/BiCROS?

I think I've been getting used to life in a mono-hearing world fairly well, not counting difficulties in understanding people while they wear masks. I thought I was going to live the rest of my life like this.  \n\n\nLast month, I had my first hearing test done. After the test, the audiologist told me about CROS hearing aids and BAHA implants, and that with my type of hearing loss, I'd be a good candidate for a BAHA. She specifically mentioned that for localization, the BAHA would be better. Also, my pocketbook would be happier if I got the BAHA, as the cost would be covered entirely by the hospital and a foundation, whereas the CROS would cost me $3-4 thousand dollars.  \n\n\nI spent the next 2 days reading on BAHA vs CROS, looking up reviews, and getting low-key excited about the possibility of getting an implant. I booked a followup appointment with the audiologist to borrow a headset for a 2 week trial. My appointment is at the end of August.\n\n2 weeks after the first appointment with the audiologist I had an appointment with the ENT who was part of my surgical team 3 years ago. This ENT is also the one who referred me to the audiologist to get the hearing test. The ENT barely even acknowledged me during the appointment, to the point that the only reason that I knew he had the right patient is because he said my surgeon's name, and referenced the date and type of surgery from 3 years ago. I extended the appointment (to 5 minutes) by bringing up the CROS vs BAHA situation, and he said that I should go for CROS because BAHA requires a surgery. I told him that I'd read the surgery is 10-60 minutes and because the incision is small, the recovery would be short, and I asked if that would be accurate, and also if he would be the surgeon. He said, yes that's true but he wouldn't be the surgeon, it would be his colleague, and the CROS is still better. He then told me to make an appointment with a different colleague of his to discuss getting the CROS.\n\nNow I'm conflicted because I'm worried that I'm dismissing important information because of my bias against the ENT. The audiologist gave me lots to read; the ENT did not. Because the hospital is a 30-45 minute drive away + paid parking, the audiologist is willing to communicate with me by phone &amp; email for appointments that don't have to be in person. The ENT is not (like I said, 5 minute conversation for the appointment, and I would need to make an appointment for the following week to talk to somebody about the CROS in person). I'm still going to keep my appointment to get the headset for 2 weeks, but right now I'm wishing that they all just forgot about me and left me to my mono-hearing world.\n\nIf you guys could share your experiences, it might help me make a decision.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2674, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I feel lost", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/oyw4uc/i_feel_lost/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Fast_Edd1e", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_16yvbx", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1628176257, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/oykebj/feeling_like_i_wasted_time_and_money_for_hearing/", "gildings": {}, "id": "oykebj", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/oykebj/feeling_like_i_wasted_time_and_money_for_hearing/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1628176268, "score": 1, "selftext": "Last year, just before everything shut down, I had gone thru the process of getting an updated hearing test and invested in some phonak hearing aids.

So just under 4 weeks ago I woke up and immediately noticed something very wrong with my hearing, but I couldn't work out what it actually was initially! I managed to get a gp appointment\u00a0 two days later (I'm in the uk) but the way I was describing it to the doctor must have been quite confusing- I was convinced that my left ear was sounding boomy, too bassy, and I couldn't tell which direction sounds were coming from, nor understand voices if more than one person was talking. The gp sent me away after an inspection of both ears, booking me in for an ENT appointment. The next day, my partner was talking to me on my right side, and it suddenly clicked - I covered my left ear, and she sounded robotic, but extremely tinny. It was pretty terrifying.\n\nI found an online hearing test, a fairly comprehensive one covering lots of frequencies, and found I'd lost nearly everything below 1500hz in my right ear, as well as everything being just less than a semitone lower than my left.\n\n\u00a0 Called the gp the next day, and after being extremely persistent, managed to get a pred prescription. By some considerable luck, I found an HBOT centre near me that is part of a charity for ms treatment, so pretty affordable, and after asking a doctor friend to write a referral for me (I couldn't get through to a gp to do it) I started HBOT on day 9.\n\nThe steroids were pretty brutal, but there hadn't been any change in my hearing up to that point. However, I woke up on day 10, and I'd regained a lot of lower frequencies - they were still 40 - 50db down, but an incredible change.\u00a0\n\nFast forward to today, and I've finished the course of pred, and I'm 10 sessions in with the HBOT. I've regained almost complete hearing in my right ear, but unfortunately I still have the diplacusis - I hear two auditory images in my right ear, one around a quarter tone lower and one a semitone lower than my left. My directionality is still a bit screwy, and I can't listen to music unless I just wear one headphone in my left as it sounds awful, but I'm still massively relieved and thankful that I regained so much hearing.\u00a0\n\nIf you're reading this and it sounds familiar - please don't bury your head in the sand or wait and see. If I hadn't found this forum, I wouldn't have questioned the doctors, nor pushed so hard for any treatment. Both gp's seemed to have no idea about ssnhl, I had to tell the second what steroid and what dose, and why I needed it immediately, and only after they called an ENT doc directly did they do it. I'm in the uk, and the NHS is a mess at the moment, I'm still waiting for an ENT appointment where I'm hoping an MRI will rule out a tumour. The NHS also doesn't acknowledge HBOT as a viable treatment so it has to be private. If you possibly can, take every treatment you can wangle as quickly as you can.\n\nIt's impossible to say what it was that caused my recovery - it could have been spontaneous, steroids or HBOT, I also cut out caffeine, reduced salt intake drastically and stopped drinking completely (I was a very light drinker anyway). I'm not expecting the diplacusis to go, but who knows, and I'm also fully aware that this may happen again, but I feel far more prepared now if it does. I wouldn't wish it on anybody, and if you're going through it now, you're not alone, and I hope you get a good outcome.\u00a0", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2673, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "SSNHL - 4 weeks on", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/oyceag/ssnhl_4_weeks_on/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hermosafunshine", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_50nbwax1", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1628117384, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/oy4e3u/does_feeling_of_fullness_go_away/", "gildings": {}, "id": "oy4e3u", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 37, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/oy4e3u/does_feeling_of_fullness_go_away/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1628117395, "score": 1, "selftext": "My 31yo daughter was just diagnosed with SSHL yesterday (3 days after it began).

I was recently diagnosed with   hearing loss in my left ear. \nIt took me almost 5 years to get diagnosed.  I remember the moment when my ear felt suddenly weird, I almost fainted , went to the hospital, and my blood pressure was abnormally high. But I told so many doctors my symptoms, went to hospitals when the pain was bad enough and no one took me serious. My symptoms are: Vertigo, head pressure on one side, not being able to pop my left ear, hearing air whoosh around in there, pain, not being able to swim or drive far distances with change in elevation really f*cks with me. Every doctor I told this to said I should do \"a Nettie pot\"( which I didn't ). But after almost 5 years I was able to finally get into the ENT for something entirely different which is RCPD( inability to burp ). Only then when I was in a proper ENT they took me seriously.  They did so many hearing tests and I failed half of them on my left ear. There is about -10 pressure in my left ear aswell. Because the negative pressure and hearing loss they decided it would be best to do an expectation surgery on August the 25th. They also gave me flonase just incase allergies is causing it. I have taken the Flonase TWICE and each time it is hell. I don't think I'm supporting to react like this. Should I stop taking it? It makes my ear burn,click, I start to feel more fullness, pressure, and intense pain. I also feel my symptoms are gradually getting worse. Last night I couldn't sleep all night. I cried and hyperventilated in pain. Spent some time over a toilet with nausea and bumped into a few things. I don't want to wait til the 15th for this inspection.  25 more days of lost sleep isn't great. Should I call my doctor? Or should I just suck it up?  I also was doing research on a Acoustic neuroma and that can that be diagnosed in an inspection surgery?

The first time I experienced completely left sided hearing loss was 5 years ago, I am 29 now (male). The first time it happened I was sleeping on the couch completely normal before sleeping and then I woke up to a phone call and the voice of the person sounded robotic, I switched the phone to my right ear and to my surprise it was good.\n\nI took prednisone a few days later and spontaneously the hearing came back. They did testing in this audio booth and my hearing was normal on both ears.\n\nFast forward 5 years later, about two months ago from today, I started to experience a lot of fullness and tightness in both my ears, keep in my mind the first then I got hearing loss I had no symptoms following up to it.

After finding this sub a day ago and hearing about the bone conducting Aftershokz headphones, I immediately ordered a pair, and thanks to overnight shipping, received them today.  \n\n\nI put them on not knowing what to expect, and started off with a song that always gave me issues with headphones -Metallica's The Four Horsemen.  The beginning guitar parts are very separate and I always miss the left guitar in headphones.  I nervously paired the headphones, hit play, and...heard BOTH GUITAR PARTS.  The trouble comes here:  I have no clue if I'm truly \"hearing\" out of my left ear, or if the nature of the bone-conducting technology is transferring everything to my right ear.  When I pull the right side off my head, it sure seems like I'm hearing out of my left ear, but having absolutely no frame of reference for 43 years, it doesn't seem that different.    \n\n\nI then searched for other blatantly stereo-separated songs, and tried Stairway to Heaven, due to the flute and guitar apparently being on different sides.  I moved one side off my head, and then the other, and was able to clearly distinguish both.  I put the headphones back on completely and distinctly heard both parts.  I then put in good earplugs to isolate outside sounds, and heard everything more clearly, but my brain is still very confused.    \n\n\nI realize the nature of this affliction makes it impossible for anyone to know what's actually happening in my head, but I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences.

The options I'd come across are either absolute junk, hard to get (Ikko makes theirs one a day a year) or just too expensive for my taste due to custom molds, etc..  \n\nEarlier this year I found out that MEE Audio offers them, just not as a single product, and at reasonable prices. Since I haven't seen anyone post here about MEE, I figured I should.  \n\nAnyway, MEE sells them indirectly: they sell a stereo-to-mono mixing cable as well as individual replacement earpieces, left and right, for their M6 Pro and MX Pro lines.  The stereo-to-mono cable and M6 earpieces are on the main MEE Audio site:\n\n* Stereo-to-mono cable ($9.99): [https://www.meeaudio.com/CABLE-MONO-M6PRO-BK/](https://www.meeaudio.com/CABLE-MONO-M6PRO-BK/)  \n(I've also seen the cable sold on Amazon.)\n* M6 Pro Replacement earpieces (scroll down) $14.99 each: [https://www.meeaudio.com/accessories/other-accessories/m6-pro-replacement-parts/](https://www.meeaudio.com/accessories/other-accessories/m6-pro-replacement-parts/)\n\nSo for $25 plus taxes and shipping you can get a single-side IEM. I'm content with the sound quality for the price, and, honestly, I like not needing a second earpiece in my deaf ear and not paying extra to have it there. \n\nThe cable is also compatible with their higher-end MX Pro earpieces, sold on their (completely separate) Professional website: [https://pro.meeaudio.com/bulk-ep-mxpro.html](https://pro.meeaudio.com/bulk-ep-mxpro.html)\n\nThe MX Pro earpieces cost between $20-$90 depending on the model, which isn't terribly expensive for IEMs.  I've purchased the M6, MX2 and MX3, and I'm pleased with the sound quality (YMMV), and the MX2 and MX3 are clear improvements over the M6.  They're also compatible with Comply foam tips.\n\nThe annoying part, though, is that the MEE Audio and MEE Professional sites are completely separate, meaning separate orders and shipping costs, and it looks like they only sell the mono cable on their not-Professional site.\n\nI do recommend checking out the actual product pages for their IEMs for more info - especially for the distinction in the MX Pro lines. **Also, if you Google hard enough there are discount codes from affiliates floating around for maybe 15% off, IIRC.**  I'm not an affiliate or employee, so I don't have any myself. \n\nAnyway, this is my contribution to this sub; if you know of any other single-side IEMs, I'd be interested to hear about them in the comments.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2635, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Inexpensive Single-side (Wired) IEMs from MEE Audio", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/on1m8e/inexpensive_singleside_wired_iems_from_mee_audio/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DCTrish", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_d7enrh2q", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626385331, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/ol2nup/ssnhl_1_week_on_prednisone_miraculous/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ol2nup", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/ol2nup/ssnhl_1_week_on_prednisone_miraculous/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "removed_by_category": "automod_filtered", "retrieved_on": 1626385341, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2632, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "SSNHL- 1 week on prednisone, miraculous", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/ol2nup/ssnhl_1_week_on_prednisone_miraculous/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "CrabHabit", "author_flair_background_color": "#ddbd37", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Left Ear"}, {"a": ":Left_ear:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/sln18qqxal611_t5_3ct5z/Left_ear"}], "author_flair_template_id": "15256174-7a3b-11e8-837e-0e5ace2388ea", "author_flair_text": "Left Ear:Left_ear:", "author_flair_text_color": "light", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_5hdjvurx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626287975, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/okaor7/pain_in_hearing_loss_ear/", "gildings": {}, "id": "okaor7", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/okaor7/pain_in_hearing_loss_ear/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1626287985, "score": 1, "selftext": "Periodically, I\u2019ll have short,  sharp pains in the ear which I had the leading loss.

So last Friday (a week ago) my husband surprised me for our anniversary. That night we went swimming and had more than a few drinks. I noticed late that evening that my hearing felt muffled in my right ear. I was drunk and thought it was water, so I slept on it thinking it would help. I woke up the next morning (saturday- 6 days ago) dizzy and unable to hear anything except a range of tinnitus noises in that ear. \n\nMy husband rushed me to the ER where they did an MRI with and without contrasf (ended up being the wrong focus area. Pituitary instead of inner ear) they gave me an IV of steroids. After 12 hours they sent me home with 4mg dose pack of steroids and Valtrex. \n\nSince it was the 4th of July weekend, no ENT was open and I had to wait until Tuesday (the 6th- 4 days ago) to see a nurse practioner and audiologist  at an ENT an hour and a half away. \n\nThe test showed profound hearing loss. I felt vibrations,  but heard nothing. The nurse practitioner put me on 60mg of prednisone for a week and then taper the dosage. In 2 weeks I go back to the ENT to recheck. \n\nI have unmedicated hypertension (I have an appointment later this month for that), profound hearing loss, and vertigo (I can walk and drive but I feel unbalanced) so everything I've read said that my prognosis  is poor. I am in despair. I would like even SOME hearing back but that seems highly unlikely. It is my third day on the 60mg of prednisone and I have no improvements. I don't know what is worse, the dizziness, the tinnitus,  or the full feeling in my right ear at all. \n\nDo I have any hope of ANY of my hearing coming back?

I went to urgent care that Saturday and there was no sign or any problems or infections, and they told me to just find a primary doctor (as I just moved to a new area had not established care yet) because \u201cplenty of people have hearing loss.\u201d\n\nI went to the ER that Sunday, and the nurse told me again, apparently nothing wrong in either ear, but this time she prescribed Flonase and Claritin and to try those and if my symptoms didn\u2019t improve to come back. Which they didn\u2019t. \n\nRinging persisted through the weekend and by Monday I had hearing loss. I was unsatisfied with the ER trip all together, so I called a health care group that Monday and scheduled a virtual doctor visit  for the NEXT Monday. Not going to cut it in this case, after all the research I knew this was a medical emergency.\n\nLuckily my girlfriend made some calls and I was able to get in to an ENT clinic that same day before they closed to have my hearing tested. \n\nI saw the doctor immediately the next morning, and he checked in both my ears, again, nothing wrong. He diagnosed me with SSHL and showed me my hearing chart and my left ear near perfect, while my right ear can only hear higher frequencies. Hearing reduced to almost 50% in the lower frequencies.\n\nHe told me anti inflammatory steroids were the go-to for this situation and he prescribed me a 14 day regiment of Prednisone. 60mg for the first 9 days then a 5 day taper. He also mentioned the possibility of a steroid injection. \n\nI was fairly hopeful after my visit with the doctor, especially considering it was only about 5 1/2 days since the ringing started, and I know you want to treat something like this ASAP.\n\nBut sadly this condition has gotten worse. The day after my appointment I started to suffer from Diplacusis Monauralis, which makes it sounds like I\u2019m hearing a duplicate noise \u201cdouble hearing\u201d in my bad ear. Everything sounds like it\u2019s echoing under water. I have to wear an earplug 24/7 because it\u2019s so distracting. I\u2019m a musician who cannot even listen let alone create music in this state.\n\nOf course this clinic happened to be moving locations over the course of the week and had to shut down until Monday. So now I\u2019m waiting to call on Monday and explain that this is getting worse and hopefully I can get in for another appointment.\n\nI have a hearing test this upcoming Tuesday and my doctor wanted to see me the same day after. I\u2019m supposed to fly out of state for 5 days and I\u2019m feeling like I should cancel the trip it seems unsafe to fly like this. I did ask the doctor and he said it should be fine, but I\u2019m so scared.\n\nThis is like putting my life on a serious hold, and I\u2019m wondering if there is a chance I have some sort of viral infection causing this to get worse. \n\nShould I have and MRI, blood test? Should I just go to the ER again and explain all of this? I feel like because I\u2019m already on Prednisone there won\u2019t be much they know how to do. This specific condition seems pretty gnarly. \n\nCould it be something as simple as clogged Eustachian Tubes? Is there anything I can do alleviate these symptoms?\n\nI have stopped using all substances, alcohol, marijuana, nicotine, etc, as they only seem to agitate and make things worse.\n\nI did vape nicotine heavily over the past 4 months and all of this following a sinus infection just seems so random and unfair.\n\nI\u2019m trying to stay positive,sorry for the terribly long ranty post, I appreciate if you read all of it. I\u2019ve been online reading about this since I got it and Reddit has seemed to be the best hub for sharing stories and learning about others\u2019 experience with this terrible thing.\n\nI just wanted to make a really good write up of my case because I haven\u2019t found one quite like mine and I wanted to share for any others going through this bullshit.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2611, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Diagnosed with SSHL (Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss) experiencing Tinnitus and Diplacusis Monauralis following a slight sinus/upper respiratory infection.

all, long story short, I\u2019m a pretty healthy 31 year old, has emergency surgery a few weeks ago on a infection down near my groin, been bed bound during recovery. \n\nA week Into recovery I suddenly went deaf over night in my right ear. By the time I got an ENT appointment I was almost 2 weeks into it being deaf, he\u2019s hit me with 3 steroid tablets a day, and have just received a few days ago an injection into my ear which is a huge dose of steroids.\n\nHe\u2019s trying to give me any chance I have of recovering any hearing loss.\n\nI\u2019m almost in tears writing this, the injection hurt like nothing I\u2019ve ever had before, I froze, and have had nightmares about it.. \n\nI\u2019m struggling to hear my son, I can\u2019t stand this ringing in my ear, and even my hobby I sometimes do; which is gaming has become much harder as I can\u2019t hear any directional audio out the right side.\n\nIs there any kind of headphones that give directional cues out just one side of the ear up, or anything ??! Right now I just need to disappear into a game, being bed bound, thinking about my wound I have, and now the hearing loss I\u2019m not in the best frame of mind, I just need a distraction, but every time I play even say, counter strike, I can\u2019t hear right and it\u2019s stopped me from being able to play competitive completely. \n\nThank you everyone for listening. I\u2019ve just found this page and think I\u2019m going to be permanently deaf in the right ear and just have no bloody idea what to expect. I sleep on the left ear down, or at least end up rolling that way, which makes me not even be able to hear anything, even my sons baby monitor.

I did not know what was going on because there was no event that caused it. No sudden pop, loud noise, sickness, stress etc. I looked online and hoped it would go away. I didn\u2019t even notice the hearing loss at the time. \n\nAfter a week with no progress I went to a doctor who misdiagnosed me as having an ear infection.. giving me antibiotics and telling me to contact an ENT if there is no improvement after a week. Well that week passed an nothing changed. \n\nI went to the ENT and had my hearing tested. That\u2019s when I found out what was missing from my left ear. \n\nMy right ear is great. Hearing all tested frequencies between 0 - 10dbs. \n\nMy left ear on the other hand is pretty good until 2k. (At 1500 I am at 20dbs of loss). I have a drop to 55dbs of loss at 4K. Back up to about 40dbs at 8k. The good thing is I do well on the speech test catching 96% of words still. \n\nI was put on high dose prednisone for the typical 2 week regimen I have seen here. And then retested after a week and a half of that treatment. I saw a very minor change in my results (so small I\u2019m skeptical it\u2019s real or if I just was better at guessing on the lowest volumes) \n\nI gained 5dbs back at 2k and 10dbs back at 8k. The biggest loss at 4K is still the same. \n\nI live for live music and love analyzing music theory and learning songs more than anything in my life. The idea of losing music is absolutely terrifying to me. The tinnitus is so variable. Today it\u2019s been probably a 2/10 compared to the worst day. I can\u2019t tell if this is a good sign or just a typical variation. \n\nMy biggest fear is I have no idea what caused this to come on so suddenly. I am worried I have some undiagnosed autoimmune disorder that could attack either ear. ( I want to protect my remaining hearing at all costs)\n\nDoes anyone have any information I should know or ask my doctors for? I have a referral for an MRI to check the nerve for any growths and will be doing that soon. \n\nWishing everyone here the best. Trying to stay positive.

ER doctors thought it was just some food poisoning  as they were focused on vertigo and throwing up .\n\nThe next day or on 3rd day ( I cant remember exactly) I went to Otolaryngologist , he gave me oral steroids. Since I went alone and I had loud tinnitus I did not understand what he said. All I remember is he gave me some medication.\n\nFor the next few months I had loud tinnitus and I thought once tinnitus goes away my hearing will come back. Then one day I went to another ear doctor and he made it clear that I have lost hearing in one year. I was in disbelief and shocked to hear that. For the next few weeks I visited several doctors to check if they had other opinions. But most of them came to same conclusion.\n\nI tried hearing aid but all it does is making sounds louder, but sounds are  incomprehensible  like a radio with bad reception .\n\nThis event has changed my life severely , I am person who stutters already and losing one ear is like losing 2 senses . \n\nShit life is hard man !!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2576, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Glad to find this group", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/nrw05i/glad_to_find_this_group/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AtxGuitarist", "author_flair_background_color": "#ddbd37", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Right Ear"}, {"a": ":Right_Ear:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/lmpao03zal611_t5_3ct5z/Right_Ear"}], "author_flair_template_id": "2ea247d4-7a3b-11e8-bbd9-0e681e192cb0", "author_flair_text": "Right Ear:Right_Ear:", "author_flair_text_color": "light", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_789n6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1622689470, "domain": "reddit.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/nr3dw7/any_baha_users_experience_skin_growth_and_flair/", "gallery_data": {"items": [{"caption": "I would have flair ups around the abutment and it would be tender.", "id": 48392783, "media_id": "ronb81wfuy271"}, {"id": 48392784, "media_id": "8106j7wfuy271"}, {"caption": "I finally got around to going to my ENT and they cut some of the growth away and injected a steroid round the site.

About a year ago, got some Viagra and it worked well, no side effects. Then back in late February, I reordered at a higher dosage. I would take maybe 1 per week on average.\n\nSome time in early March, I notice I had some fullness in my right ear, and things sounded a little robotic. But not a big deal. Couldn't get an appointment with my regular doctor, so went to Urgent Care. They looked in my ear and said it looked like I had fluid in my ear and was a bit infected. But me on antibiotics and decongestants. 10 days later, I finished the antibiotics, but the ear was the same. Maybe 3 days later, it cleared up.\n\nThen about a week or 2 later, it came back again. Tried to make an appointment with my doctor AND with an ENT. Explained my symptoms and what happened in the past. They couldn't see me for WEEKS. Went to a different Urgent Care, and told the same thing. Looks like some fluid, a bit of infection. They put me on antibiotics and decongestants for 10 days. Again, this didn't clear it up.\n\nSo I finally got an ENT appointment May 21st, and they tested me. Said I have Moderate hearing loss in the low ranges (I think). Doc said I could try steroid treatment. So he put me on 7 days pills and did an injection into my ear.\n\nImmediately after the injection, I had increased ringing in my ear that has stayed the same, maybe a little worse even, for the last 6 days. I am supposed to go in and get a second injection tomorrow.\n\nHas anybody had ringing in their ears from the steroids? I'm hoping it will go away.

This subreddit that my wife found for me is the best resource I have so far. It gave me the strength to fight and be proactive about my SHL.\n\nAfter getting a diving certification last Sunday (which went fine, no incident to report), I started losing hearing from my right ear on Monday. It progressed until Wednesday when I became completely deaf in this ear. Immediately diagnosed with SHL, I've started Prednisone the same day. I'm 30yo btw.\n\nThe next day (Thursday, yesterday) I went to the ENT which confirmed an idiopathic severe to profound SHL with tinnitus. They agreed to give me injections of steroids in the ear, but wouldn't give me referrals for anything else. They don't believe diving caused it, although it could've been the extra stress that woke it up. They are talking about a virus, maybe... They're lost (I don't blame them for that, I realize how poorly understood SHL is).\n\nI luckily found someone who had the exact same issue as I have. Went diving and then lost hearing in 3 days. Being a pro diver he knew that it was decompression sickness (which caused a carbon dioxide intoxication), and recovered hearing after a few months of HBOT.\n\nI'm not sure that it's decompression sickness in my case, but it looks very similar. Therefore I went ahead and booked a session of HBOT for today. And here is the question I have: I'm in Hawaii/Honolulu, and I found this wellness center which offers HBOT. It's not a fancy one, and goes only to 1.5 bars (like around 15feet underwater). It's not as strict as hospital ones (I'm actually allowed to have my phone, I'm writing this while in the individual chamber). Good thing is that it's \"affordable\" (2500$ for 20hours, yeah that's expensive but nothing close to hospitals).\n\nDoes anyone know if this is a high enough pressure? I can't find any resource, aside the fact that it seems to be the minimal possible, and usually they go to 2 to 3 bars in hospitals.\n\nThank you for your advices if you have any.

I don't even know if I was born that way or if I suffered from an infection, or if I have Waardenberg type 2.\n\nMy first memory I ever had when I noticed something was different about my hearing was when I was 5 years old, playing outside in my backyard. I tilted my head up towards the sky and noticed an airplane flying over me. When I turned my head to where my deaf ear was pointing up to the sky, I noticed the plane made a different sound. You can imagine how weird that must've been for a parent to see their kid on the lawn tilting their head from one side to the other, haha. But as a person who suffers from SSD, you probably know what I mean about how it \"sounds different\". Which basically means the audio is now going around your head so that your \"good ear\" can hear it.\n\nFrom then on, I've had a life of always being on someone's right side, switching my audio to mono on all of my devices and just wishing I can understand how and why my ear went deaf.\n\nHas anyone else been in the same boat as me? Where you're just trying to figure out why you're deaf in your ear? Did you ever finally find out why?\n\nI think up until recently I started to really be stereo hearing envious with all the \"3D Audio\" marketing coming out with these newer headphones. 3D Audio, surround sound, all of that doesn't mean anything to me. It's all just a single source of audio to me.\n\nI've even reached out to universities and asked if they ever need a test subject for state of the art advancements in science related to hearing loss.\n\nI don't know why I'm rambling in this post, but I'm just happy that I can read other people's experiences and not feel so alone in this.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nEDIT: Typos",

After three intratympanic steroids, it was not restored. I have a CROS hearing aid on order. \n\nIs there anyone else out there that had specifically an intralabyrinthine schwannoma? I'm curious what anyone else's experience was like. I've combed reddit and the Acoustic Neuroma Association message boards for information but there isn't much out there for intralabyrinthine schwannomas. It is my understanding that they are more rare than acoustic neuromas, as they form inside the cochlea/canals.

Everything sounds pretty crazy and distorted, though, sort of like there is two different pitches to all incoming sound - it's uncomfortable but not quite maddening. I honestly can't tell if the hearing if the recovered hearing is all that useful yet.\n\nFor those whose hearing partially recovered over a longer time frame, did the \"balance\" between the ears improve (maybe like how unilateral CI users report the robotic voices in the implanted ear gradually merging with the natural hearing ear), or did you just acclimate to the new normal?

The antibiotics did nothing so I was told to try a decongestant nasal spray for a week or so but as my ear wasn't blocked it made no difference. I have now been referred to see an ENT but I'm in the UK and with things the way they are I've been told the waiting list I'm on is 51 weeks long!!! Both me and the gp have tried to get it pushed forward but it doesn't seem to do anything. I don't know if it is sensoneural or not but based on what I've read I belive it is.

The operation was done in june, and since then I had one severe, very bad infection of the skin around and it was treated with 2 weeks of antibiotics including strong pills, not just creme. This occured in somewhat September, roughly 2 - 3 months after the Operation. After like 4 \"emergency\" visits on my local hearing clinic in germany ( it was weekend, thats why emergency ) it got better.. but again. The medics are very intense and very side effect heavy. I thought this waa it and of that would happen to me like once a year I'd be fine with it.\n\nNow it is kinda happening again. This time I felt it way before and treated it with free sellable medicine that works against the process of infections. \nIve been putting on a anti infection creme for the past 7 or 8 days in hope of stopping it. \nWell..now im sitting here with an infected screw / skin again. It has pain and the skin is swollen aswell as beeing kinda.. well.. not bloody..but purulent (?). I kinda do not want to go to the emergency again, since corona is everywhere and the last time I went was very exhausting and shitty Experience.\nThe doctors will see me in like 10 days to Check if the screw was healing well and if the screw connected to my bone, but I have the weirs feeling I need to visit them earlier, actually in 3 or 4 days next week.\n\nJust to clarify. I've cleaned and taken care of the skin and the screw around it. I've carefully removed the dead skin whenever it was time for it. The dead skin is kinda normal, since the skin grows.. I've desinfectated the skin mostly after showering and when I went on cleaning everything around the screw. I didnt put on any cremes on a regular basis since the doctors specifically told me not to and to leave it alone, apart from the Care taking Im currently doing.\n\nMy question is: \n\nWill the doctors head towards the removal of the implant since 2 very bad infections occured inbetween the span of 5-6 months? \n\nThis kinda is blocking my mind and Im kinda scared of what could happen next. Im feeling uncomfortable and the risk of this occuring more often was there, thats what the doctors have been telling me, but the percentage of people where this is happening was very low.. so I took the risk and it actually had helped my hearing issue ( as expected by the pre testing ).\n\nBut if Im having infections / inflammations every 3 months I dont really know if thats the solution. Again the medicine is strong and it beats on my whole body whenever I take them. \n\nIm sorry for the long text and the broken english.. Any ideas on this? Maybe something that I could Change.. or do right now without going to the doctors on the weekend? Or maybe some of you have had experience on often occuring infections and how it got treated? \n\nThanks.. and have a nice evening.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2211, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Issues with my BAHA screw - infection of the skin ( left side )", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/k6rqt9/issues_with_my_baha_screw_infection_of_the_skin/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "amarviratmohaan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2hnbcpf7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1607103964, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/k6powf/ssd_from_childhood_with_issues_in_good_ear/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k6powf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/k6powf/ssd_from_childhood_with_issues_in_good_ear/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1607103975, "score": 1, "selftext": "Has anyone ever had tinnitus and hearing loss (that you may not have been able to identify but came up in your audiometry) randomly start in your good ear for no identifiable reason? \n\nRecently been having tinnitus (absolutely awful - rules out sleeping on my good ear, which I've done ever since I can remember), a blocked ear (feels like fluid is rolling down my ear sometimes when lying down), and random earaches.

After researching online some and finding this great community I feel like I might be able to gain some valuable insight here. Hopefully you all don\u2019t mind me explaining my experience and asking asking for your thoughts?\n\nSo earlier today I experienced a fairly loud ringing in just my right ear. Started small and continued until it was a fairly loud and annoying. Definitely thought it was weird but hey things happen and I decided to continue working through the discomfort. \n\nAfter an hour I noticed the ringing had dimmed fairly significantly and I decided to get up from my desk. Instantly felt a sensation like I was on a boat, not really dizzy or spinning just unsure on my feet. This alarmed me and immediately some red flag shot up in my mind. Started to take note of my body and noticed fairly quickly I couldn\u2019t hear out of my right ear. I mean totally deaf. \n\nNeedless to say I was pretty alarmed.  My girlfriend who is a nurse told me to go to urgent care so I did. The doctor there checked my ear said there were no perforations in the drum, earwax blocking the canal or any redness or signs of infection. She did however mention she could see some fluid behind the drum? While she mentioned the fluid she was perplexed as to what caused my sudden deafness in just my right ear. She told me to go see a ENT and to take a decongestant. \n\nSo off I went, grabbed a MucinexDM and  waited a few hours. Thing is, there is no sign of improvement. So of course I hopped online and checked out what it could be. The only causation that really seems to be the closest thing I experienced is SSHL. \n\nMy question to the community is this, has anyone experienced similar symptoms/ experience with losing their hearing? I\u2019d love to hear others stories or thoughts on my experience if their willing to share. \n\nJust to reiterate I plan on seeing an ENT tomorrow. If I lose my hearing permanently in one ear so be it. My hopes are it\u2019s not life threatening and really just make the ringing stop. \n\nThanks everyone, cheers!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2203, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Question \u201cgoing to see an ENT\u201d", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/k4c1dq/question_going_to_see_an_ent/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Biblos_Geek", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1xjdz9nj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606783125, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/k49j84/the_2e1vibe_headphone_for_the_single_sided_deaf/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k49j84", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/k49j84/the_2e1vibe_headphone_for_the_single_sided_deaf/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "G5jkmnh96yAbaKmbZ58Wbv1Ggp2st492hYZry9AXRDs", "resolutions": [{"height": 60, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-kwBjWuvGtQSfV_6n0iPgfyYQq9EIAjQAO4WDzK7gTg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f7d02fe22e06c460ddaee3a7da4cd023863fcea", "width": 108}, {"height": 121, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-kwBjWuvGtQSfV_6n0iPgfyYQq9EIAjQAO4WDzK7gTg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=972c15e11dc141fd37d22a597ccf160b548077b8", "width": 216}, {"height": 180, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-kwBjWuvGtQSfV_6n0iPgfyYQq9EIAjQAO4WDzK7gTg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a51e3d18c3e26105a6eb1125b1f92086868c3cdf", "width": 320}, {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-kwBjWuvGtQSfV_6n0iPgfyYQq9EIAjQAO4WDzK7gTg.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68c84daf8a8669e066860e53bdb3c9a73df88dd1", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-kwBjWuvGtQSfV_6n0iPgfyYQq9EIAjQAO4WDzK7gTg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=82182261068d821db21dadd817356996bb5c5a80", "width": 640}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1606783136, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am honored to have had my 2E1+Vibe headphones were [live reviewed and demoed playing Valorant](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/820971867) by a single sided gamer [Twitch.tv/chahzzy](https://Twitch.tv/chahzzy). \n\nI describe my [2E1+Vibe headphones here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/d1zauq/my_2e1vibe_headphone_build/) which I beta tested thanks to the Reddit community.

I've been through a multiple very aggressive series of steroid treatments, and the ear actually recovered a little bit from profound to probably around severe in most frequencies (I have an audiogram coming up to confirm.)\n\nThe first month I was a total wreck - I couldn't sleep or eat, non-stop catastrophic thinking, all the usual sudden hearing loss stuff. I did get some great professional help, and with some low-dose anti-anxiety pills and sleeping aids I get a decent amount of sleep (though I sometimes wonder about the quality.)  I also talked to some of the awesome folks on this sub, who really helpful in helping me calm down and get perspective - I always be grateful for those messages. Overall, my mental state feels pretty good - I'm no longer fixated on \"why me\" thoughts and have been keeping a positive attitude.\n\nBut, now that I'm well in to month three, I feel like I said in the title of the post - like I'm failing at managing my SSD. My auditory system is still totally out of whack, so I have a hard time watching TV or movies because the garbled nonsense (some might call this reactive tinnitus) created by the residual hearing in my bad ear makes the whole experience disorienting and unpleasant. Likewise, reading for fun is still hard because I just end up listening to the tinnitus, no matter how hard I focus on the material. Walking outdoors isn't fun yet because there are so many strange sound distortions, though I still make sure to get out of the building at least once a day. My hypervigilant good ear feels cranked up to 12 all the time, and can do fun party tricks like fix in the barely audible buzz of the fridge to make me feel like I'm getting tinnitus in my last remaining ear. And so on and so on.\n\nI realize it's a bad idea to compare your hearing loss journey to others, but it just seems like many on this board weren't necessarily back to normal at the the three or four month mark, but were at least able to enjoy a Netflix show or walk to the park. \n\nAny advice or words of encouragement?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit":

She prescribed some antibiotics and told me to get on decongestions. \n\nAt this point it's 3 and decide to take a nap, hoping I wake up and my ear will be better, wake up 2 hours later and I'm kind of freaked out, cause the ringing is a lot louder at this point. I decide to get my airpods and test out my hearing and low and behold I don't hear a peep out of my right ear. I then decide to look up what could be happening and run into SSHL. I'm kind of freaked out at this point and it says to get treatment as soon as possible so I decide to go to the ER.\n\nAt the ER I tell the doctor my symptoms, and he refuses to prescribe me steroids. Because I quote \"I've never seen a case of SSHL in my 25 years, the chances you have it are really low\". He also had to look it up and gave me false information that I had 2 weeks before I had to go see an ENT. That really pissed me off, what if someone less proactive heard this advice and lost complete hearing from it?\n\nAnyways, after wasting $250 at the ER I go home and take a sleeping pill so I can fall asleep with this crazy ringing. I wake up at 7, decide to take the day off work and schedule an appointment at 9:50 with an ENT. I take the hearing test and I'm basically completely deaf in my right ear. Get diagnosed with SSHL and given steroids. 40mg prednisone for 4 days, then 30mg the next 4 days, then 20 mg the next 4 days etc, for a total of 16 days. \n\nI asked my doctor what are my chances, the statistics and he says its split into 3rds. 1/3 recover, 1/3 experience no change and 1/3 get worse. He said it wouldn't be possible for me to really get worse. I have my MRI scheduled for next week. \n\nMy questions are, is it really only a 1/3 chance I recover? I'm seeing different information on the internet. How do cochlear implants work? Do I need to restore some hearing for that to work? Should I get the injections as soon as possible? The doctor said that oral is the first step and if after 2 weeks of no response then he would do the injections. Should I push back on this and try and get them right away? Can the infection spread to my other ear? I'm really scared of losing complete hearing in both ears, just thinking about it makes me want to cry. \n\nThanks in advance :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 2185, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just diagnosed with SSHL", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/jwabq8/just_diagnosed_with_sshl/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "reinbeergames", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1mr233wg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605637428, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/jvy99h/day_11/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jvy99h", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 26, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/jvy99h/day_11/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1605666186, "score": 8, "selftext": "I lost my hearing in my right ear 11 days ago.\n\nI posted something  several days ago and got a lot of helpful insight and came in contact with a lot of helpful people.\n\nI go see my otolaryngologist for the audio tests and possible injections today (I have been on Steroids for 9 days now). \n\nOk so here's the deal.

But as I got done with my paperwork I took of the earbuds and noticed that I still couldn\u2019t hear in the right ear. For some reason I didn\u2019t panic. I thought, \u2018eh, I\u2019m probably about to get an ear infection or it\u2019ll resolve itself I\u2019m sure.\u2019 I went on about my day. Later that night I noticed that I was getting dizzy/light headed when I walked. Still, I didn\u2019t panic. I thought it was probably the oncoming ear infection or something of that nature. I went to bed because I had a test the next day and I wanted to wake up early to study. \n\nWell, the next day at about 5:30 in the morning I couldn\u2019t get up. The moment I lifted my head off the pillow, the whole world started spinning. I remember falling back in bed and grabbing on for dear life, as if I was going to fly away or something. It was a terrible feeling. My mom took me to an urgent care clinic because I did not believe this to be urgent enough for an emergency room, just really inconvenient. The nurse practitioner said it wasn\u2019t an infection and confirmed that there was no ear wax built up or anything. She sent me home with a prescription for oral steroids and told me to contact my PCP to get referred to an ENT. Well, it was Saturday so I had to wait until Monday to reach my PCP. So I laid in bed for the weekend due to the vertigo. \nMonday came and I was able to get in to see an ENT that same day. They tested my hearing and found that I was profoundly deaf in my right ear. During the exam I noticed that I couldn\u2019t hear, but I could feel vibrations. I imagine it was because my auditory bones were vibrating due to the sound. My doctor wasn\u2019t very optimistic from the start. He said that people that experience this kind of hearing loss don\u2019t usually get it back. But he set me up for two weeks of oral steroids, blood work, MRI and took me off from work for two weeks. No tumors/abnormalities noted in the MRI and no viruses or bacteria noted in my bloodwork. So he officially diagnosed me with idiopathic SSNHL. In other words he didn\u2019t know what caused my deafness and had no other way to figure it out. He said it was possible that my nerve just died or perhaps died due to poor circulation, but these are just theories. At the two week mark my hearing test still showed that I was profoundly deaf. My doctor offered me the opportunity to try steroid injections and I agreed to do it because I wanted to try everything. The first injection was very uncomfortable. Actually all three were uncomfortable lol. I dreaded my appointments knowing I had to have a needle stuck through my ear drum every time. 0 out of 5 stars, would not recommend. Anyway, after the first injection we saw a significant improvement in my hearing. I was able to hear really LOUD noises. My audiologists was able to say some words and it took a few tries to understand but I got it eventually. I felt a little emotional. Which surprised me because I had convinced myself that I was fine and would live life as if nothing had changed. But this clearly proved that I was missing something and that I had not allowed myself to mourn or grieve over the loss of my right ear. My doctor was finally somewhat optimistic and said we might be able to get enough hearing back for me to be able to benefit from a hearing aid. At this point he said I was only a candidate for a CROS device. So we continued the steroid injections. After the second shot and two week wait period we saw a little more improvement but not as much as the first time. This Monday I had my third and final steroid injection. I have my next appointment in 6 weeks to see where I stand and what my options are. I\u2019m nervous to see what the future has in store, but I am hopeful that I will adapt regardless of the outcome. \n\nI am back to work on the ambulance, which I was really happy about after being home for a month and a half. I don\u2019t get dizzy, I do have tinnitus, but I rarely notice it until I talk about it. Like, right now I\u2019m very aware of it lol I have also noticed that I\u2019m more sensitive to loud noises. I tend to cringe and duck my head when I hear something loud. I don\u2019t do well in loud situations but I\u2019m sure that is something I can work on. Listening to music is not the same as it was before. Which is very disappointing. I have been trying to adjust my cars sound system because I love to listen to music when I drive. Especially during my commute to work. I have yet to try the mono sound setting. Being back at work I have noticed that I use only one stethoscope earbud rather than two when I have to use them. I just don\u2019t see the need to use them both. I bought a sound amplifier that I\u2019ll be returning because all it does (which is what it is intended for as the name suggests \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02) is make things louder but not clearer. And that only frustrates me more. So I\u2019ve decided I\u2019ll just be wearing an earplug in my right ear that will hopefully hint people that my right ear is no good and they\u2019ll be able to move to my left when they talk to me. I\u2019m going to figure things out as I go and definitely check this forum out frequently for helpful advice. Thank you for reading my story. Also, I\u2019d love to hear some advice/stories from healthcare providers that suffer from SSD!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1700, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A Paramedic With One Good Ear", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/fq2z2z/a_paramedic_with_one_good_ear/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "guiltypleasure39", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_65jgv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1585316655, "domain": "self.MonoHearing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/fpx5vu/wfh_discovery/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fpx5vu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MonoHearing/comments/fpx5vu/wfh_discovery/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1585316659, "score": 1, "selftext": "This may not mean much to the rest of the world, but I just discovered live captioning on Microsoft TEAMS meetings and how to set it up on Webex calls.

I'm still in training but there have already been several instances when a coworker has said hello to me and I \"ignored\" them  because I didn't hear them, or the managers have told me to do something but I couldn't hear the instructions because they were on my left side, so I ended up doing the wrong thing because I misheard. I also feel like I have missed out on some training info because the manager was standing my my wrong side and I couldn't turn my head fast enough. I feel like I will need to tell them about my hearing loss, but I am afraid of being teased about it again, or worse, them saying I can't adequately do the job because of the hearing loss. \n\nI am able to adequately wait on tables, that has never been an issue. All I have to do is lean in a bit with my good ear, they are seated so it is easy to position myself. On the few occasions where I have had a hard time hearing an order, I have just apologized and told them I'm a bit hard of hearing on that side, sometimes making a joke about it myself, and the customer's never seem to mind having to repeat themselves. The only problem I really have is when someone unexpectedly says something to me while on my left side, and I can't make out what they are saying, or sometimes I don't notice them talking to me at all.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 1650, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just started a new job 3 days ago, my hearing loss is already becoming a problem.

At SXSW [Bose showed off](https://www.wareable.com/smartglasses/bose-ar-smartglasses-review-8664) its audio AR glasses, and companies like [Vue](https://www.wareable.com/smartglasses/vue-smart-glasses-review%5C) are taking a similar route.\n\nAlso at the Austin show was asEars, a student startup making smartglasses for people with single-sided deafness. The glasses have a microphone on the rim that picks up sound and an onboard sound processor that transmits it to a bone conduction mic over the impaired ear.\n\n***Read this:*** [*Aira's smartglasses use humans, not AI, to help the deaf*](https://www.wareable.com/smartglasses/aira-glasses-blind-interpreter-3111)\n\nThat processor detects which noises are coming from the direction of the impaired ear and makes sure only those sounds are being played into it. It's like a CROS hearing aid, but less intrusive. While not everyone will want to wear glasses, I can completely see the appeal for people who'd rather keep the technology concealed.\n\nAnd importantly, they look good and feel light. Well, the 3D-printed prototypes I saw did. The unit I tried on wasn't fully working due to a malfunction, but I was able to feel the vibrations in the bone conduction working when someone nearby spoke.\n\n*Processing img o0qy7ttwnrk21...*\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/2wojk0bvnrk21.png\n\nThe student team, which is funded by the University of Tokyo, has been working on the asEars glasses for 10 months and wants to get them into production next year.\n\nThe idea was inspired by one of the leaders of the team who has single-sided deafness, but there's a big market for this type of device. In the US, [an estimated 60,000 people](https://www.hear-it.org/single-sided-deafness) get SSD (also known as unilateral hearing loss) every year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(This article seems familiar - if this was posted on here my apologies.

So I have profound sensorineural loss in my right ear for eight years now. The main problem is that it took someone who had trouble socially and made them utterly incapable of interacting with people in most places and contexts...\n\nI was reluctant to try cros-type hearing aids because I\u2019m aware of the limitations and drawbacks they have, and I\u2019m finding the amplification of the background noise really difficult. The other problem is that it doesn\u2019t seem to pick up on people\u2019s voices except in silent places where I don\u2019t need it.\n\nI went to a restaurant tonight and the hearing aid amplified babies screaming, glasses clinking, people murmuring, and order pagers beeping, but I couldn\u2019t hear the server standing to my right at all (not even their voice). I think it actually made it worse, I kept at it because I want to adjust to the background noise but having the dome in my ear blasting background noise seemed to interfere with hearing people on my left. It was bizarre because it seemed to boost EVERYTHING but the server\u2019s voice, I could pick out all those noises quite clearly but was helpless with the person next to me. Happened twice at varying distances.\n\nIt did help a bit with the speaker directly to my front, however I\u2019m not sure I needed it. We were at a table by ourselves btw.\n\nOn the other hand having access to the external microphone system (and induction) is huge and I will probably keep the devices for that, I noticed shopping with people was a lot easier. Not sure it can help with strangers.\n\nI just wanted to vent a little and ask what is normal here? I go back to my audiologist in a month or so and I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s an ideal way to present my concerns (could it be the programming? Am I misusing them? Is it just the inherent limitation of the device? Maybe I should try another? No idea). I know not everyone has success, but I know some do and I was persuaded to give them a go and after the success of the microphone system I\u2019m keen to see if I can get anything else out of them. Basically I don\u2019t want to shoot myself in the foot with self-fulfilling prophecies.\n\nSorry if this post was a bit long!

I'm 18 years old and never thought I had any problem with my hearing. But about a week ago I decided to take an online hearing test that just popped up on the front page of Reddit. I was just curious so I went along with it. This turned out to be one of the worst mistakes that I've made (or is it a good thing? really don't know). I noticed that my right ear was worse than my left. I was in the \"mild hearing loss\" spectrum in the test and became really paranoid. I also have tinnitus when it's really quiet or when I'm focusing on it. I always thought it was normal.\n\nI ended up going to an ENT and then it was confirmed. I have mild hearing loss in my right ear in the low to mid range frequencies. For some reason still within the normal limits in the higher frequencies. It was *conductive hearing loss* . Meaning that I heard all the vibrations but couldn't hear as well. They scheduled me for another appointment in 3 months to see if it gets worse. Their hypothesis is that this relates to the very bad ear infection I had when I was young. The ear infection was the size of a strawberry.\n\nEven if it's mild, it's been really hard to deal with. I never really noticed this before so I shouldn't really make it get to me. But I'm a musician and the thought that this COULD be progressive really hits me hard. I've literally been bed-bound these past 2-3 days and just been sleeping. Trying to get this out of my mind. \n\nI can't stop noticing it now, I frequently cover my ears to see the differences of the ears and freak out. The ENT said that I shouldn't worry about this.. but people my age don't really have to deal with this sort of stuff. I feel handicapped in some way. I get anxiety everytime I ask someone to repeat themselves because I think it's because of my hearing loss.\n\nI'm an aspiring musician and my dream job is making music. Music has helped me through a lot and the thought of losing that makes me very depressed.\n\nI know that many of you guys have significant damage to one of your ears and are entirely mono so I know that I'm not really in the same situation as you do and I'm not trying to belittle your struggles and put it at the same level as mine, so I'm sorry if I offended you in any way. I'm just curious on how you got over this. I'm feeling so alone and scared.\n\nDoes this get better? How did you cope with this? Do I ever get the life I had before discovering this back..? I have a really strong history of health anxiety and seeing a worry come true is really frightening.

But my mom is notoriously bad with doctor visits, never saves any paperwork and never remembers anything from the visit!!  Lol it's cute but kinda frustrating. \n\nCue to me and my husband getting pregnant, SUDDENLY my mom remembers this potential genetic complication and gets tested with 23 and Me.  Turns out she is a carrier for Nonsyndromic Hearing Loss and Deafness, DFNB1 (GJB2-Related).  If my dad were to be tested, he would turn out to be a carrier too.  Each copy of my dna, one strand from each parent, contains this hearing loss gene.  I will be passing at least the carrier form on to my child.  If my husband is a silent carrier as well, my child will have hearing loss.  If both of his dna strands are \"clean\" of this bad gene, my child will be safe from it but she will be a carrier for it to the next generation.\n\nThis all makes so much sense to me and sheds light on what was such a confusing factoid about me; where did my hearing loss come from?  My family has no \"history\" of deafness but that honestly does not matter; silent carriers can be passed down for generations, and most of us honestly only know the medical history of a couple generations up before it starts getting nebulous.  1 in 33 people are apparently carriers for this gene, AND it contributes to over 50% of all genetic hearing loss cases.\n\nIf you don't know the cause of your partial hearing loss that you've had from birth, consider genetic testing either for you if you can afford it, or convince one of your parents to give it a shot!  I'm not thrilled about what this could mean for my child and wish I had known before we started trying, but the wheels are already in motion, and we'll love her and she'll be a little smartass no matter what.

I'm almost completely deaf in my left ear but my right ear is fine. \n\nI have extremely loud high pitched tinnitus in the bad ear, and my hearing loss is in the lower register, which means I can't really hear at all. If I cover my good ear all I hear is muffled sounds, like I'm trying to listen to someone talk through two walls. \n\nI'm considering getting a surgery called a Labrinthectomy, which is where the nerve that controls hearing and balance in my bad ear is completely severed. My good ear would be the only one controlling balance. My vertigo issues are completely unbearable and since my hearing is almost completely gone, this surgery might be the best option to help me live a normal life. Needless to say, the surgery will render me completely deaf in that ear (but the tinnitus will probably stay, yay! /s).\n\nFrom reading through this subreddit, it seems most of you were deaf in one ear since birth or since you were young children. I'm 28 now, and my symptoms started to develop when I was about 23. My hearing started to decline a few years ago. \n\nI'm currently waiting for an appointment to see if I can get hearing aids covered. I'm not sure if there's any point, as the clarity in my bad ear is completely gone and amplifying the sound won't help that, and I'm not sure if CROS aids work well if you still have a bit of hearing in the bad ear.

There will be additional features to complement the device such as a location indicator to the sound source, a sensitivity toggle for determining the importance of the noise source and a data-log for the alerts that occur.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MonoHearing", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ct5z", "subreddit_subscribers": 676, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Me and my team are currently in the process of prototyping a sound sensor aimed for hearing impaired individuals.

I got an MRI done and nothing looked out of the ordinary. I was told I had a dead ear and he set me up with an audiologist for a hearing aid.\n\nThis was back in May, which the audiologist never called me back, it\u2019s okay though because I was back in my college town and now I\u2019m in a different state since I just graduated college.\nI\u2019m looking for ENTs around my new area.\n\nI was just wondering if anyone has ever had experience with this?

The last 11 or so days my ears have been extremely sensitive to external pressure, specifically the tissue under my ear, behind the jaw. Whenever it gets touched my ear seems to close up, but this goes away in an hour or two. This also happens when I go to sleep, since I move my head when sleeping. \n\nOn the second day of this happening, I called my GP, and the assistant told me it can't have anything to do with wax, since my ears were completely cleaned about a month ago. So I decided to sleep it out every day, since my hearing seemed to be normal every afternoon. I thought it was just sensitivity, and that it'd slowly diminish.\n\nBut today I woke up with an almost complete lack of hearing in my right ear. I was a bit worried because it was more intense, I felt pressure and a constant ringing sound, but no intense pain. My hearing didn't recover in the afternoon, and I began to get worried. So I called the emergency GP office ( since it's the weekend ). Initially they didn't want to schedule me, and I felt a bit ashamed for calling up, maybe it wasn't an emergency? I tried reading about it online and realized it could be very severe, so I called up again and insisted on getting an appointment, they still were reluctant but scheduled me for 9 am. That's in 7 hours.\n\nDo any of you have advice on what I should say?

When I was six weeks old  I probably had menigitis or a really bad ear infection, and the guesses are that I lost my hearing at that time. Lucky me doesn't know any better, but unlucky me does experience all the troubles that come along with it like all of you do.  \n\n\nSo fast forward 17 years later, I got tired of it. I wanted to hear properly, did some google searches and found out that there actually were hearing aids for SSD. Went to my GP, got referred to the audiologic centre, and got to try the BAHA for some weeks. I was thrilled. I would be able to hear! However, my excitement was washed away pretty quickly as I came to realize that ofcourse, silly me, it wouldn't allow me to really properly hear.  I can remember it helped a bit, but it felt like as soon as there was noise on my right (hearing) side, my brain would like completely ignore all the sound that the BAHA processed and it would not benefit me anymore.   \n\n\nFast forward another 6 years (I'm currently 23), I am experiencing quite some trouble at work and always find myself exhausted after a day of meetings which require some intense listening. The BAHA is tempting me again, and I am wondering whether I should give it another shot. I am older, I am more aware of what to expect, and perhaps now I can feel a difference and make a more rational decision.   \n\n\n**So Long story short. Does anyone have any experiences with the BAHA? Does it indeed block the input as soon as there is sound on the hearing side? And I have never experienced the CROSS.
