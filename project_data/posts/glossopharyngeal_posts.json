Hand, shoulder, lower back pain &amp; I feel cold. It all started when I woke and felt like I had tonsillitis. Last time I had it was last year using natural remedies to tough it out. And it affected both sides within the 7 day period, body aches and all. \n\nFast forward to now 2 mornings ago i wake up with this pain. When I gargled salt water I noticed there was an enlarged spot on the left side as well as the right. The right was is the culprit. Any way I brushed my teeth, tongue &amp; the effected pain area (LIGHTLY) for how effective it was last time. But something weird occurred after gargling the salt water again after brushing. When I spat the mild fluids out the white pus spot I saw on my tonsil left with it. Tried getting a good grab, but it was as if it was like a soft oat cluster or something. \n\nDid any of you notice white spots whilst examining? Anyway now my left side where it has been STINGING to unbearable levels. However something horrifying keeps happening to me. Everytime I use something to make the pain go away i. E ice cream, muscle relaxers, drinking water, ghetto popsicles, 800 ibuprofen, Zinc tabs, EVEN gargling salt water the pain would come back and using the remedies DON'T WORK the second time around. \n\nI have a bad habit of swallowing all of my food to the affected side as well, I even subconsciously swallow my saliva in my sleep and it feels like DEATH. All of the just from WAKING UP IN THE MORNING?!? Wtf idk what to do any more. I'm an active service member with a lot that rides on me at work, so if I'm out the loop there's a MAJOR redundancy issue. Also military healthcare isn't the brightest if you hadn't heard so I could be out for weeks trying to diagnose the cause. \nHas anyone woke up and a similar situation to mine?

Dull, achy, lumpy. \n* Can sometimes feel pain in the left ear - but MUCH less often since tonsillectomy \n* Pain is aggravated by talking, drinking carbonated beverages, being stressed out, vaping but ONLY on the left side, seemingly ruling out any contact dermatitis type of things \n* Occasionally, a weird taste in the back of the throat in this general region \n* Early on the pain was more noticeable when eating and drinking, this has subsided some, where eating and drinking do not seem to cause direct irritation as much or as often. Now it is just a dull never ending \"lumpy\" feeling on the left side, often in the tongue but also a scratchy pain in the throat at times.

I made a Reddit account just to join this community, as it's been a bit of a rough year. Starting last summer I developed this dull lump feeling on the right side of my throat every time I swallowed. Sometimes it was just irritating, sometimes like swallowing glass, always on the right side. I went through many rounds of antibiotics, as I am a carrier for strep throat, and yet the lump feeling never fully went away. It got so painful I started missing a ton of work and stopped being as social as I usually am, spending many nights laying in bed instead. Several ents said they could see nothing wrong, but decided to take my tonsils out due to me being a strep carrier. That was about two months ago, and the lump never left. I saw another ENT and they suggested I may have glossopharyngeal neuralgia, as they could see nothing physically wrong in my throat. They put me on medication about a month ago, and I'll say that while it hasn't been as bad as in the past I am still having discomfort. Anyways I guess why I'm writing all this is because I'm a bit worried, and wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience?

I had MVD December first, last year. I didn't want to make any report before this because the healing process proceeds in fits and starts. \n\n\nI can say that I do feel much better now and the doctor said I have no restrictions on physical activities. I've just started back with exercises. Pushups, deep knee bends and situps. I've only been walking for exercise since the surgery. My first day is disappointing. 10 pushups, 10 deep knee bends and 6 situps. It should get better quickly. I'm 66 years old and before surgery I could do 100 pushups, 25 deep knee bends and 20 situps. I'm looking forward to getting back to that. I'd also like to start back riding my bike again. \n\n\n\nSo, how do I feel? I'm glad that the GN shocks are much lessened. I used to get up to hundreds of shocks a day and up to 9 out of 10 pain. My only relief was on oxcarbazepine. It did control the pain and gave me back my sanity/life. The side effects, bruising and pain on fingers and bottoms of my feet along with terrible stomach upset were becoming untenable, hence the surgery. The nerves were entangled with blood vessels and would never have gotten better by themselves. The surgeon says the surgery was successful in taking care of the problem. There is still infrequent GN pain and it seems mostly vestigial. That is, my nerve is recreating something that it used to react to, without the same stimulus. It's like an echo of the pain I used to have. Does that make sense? It's hard to describe now, but it's still frightening. I'm hoping that goes away soon. One thing from the surgery that has lingered, but is slowly getting better, is that my swallowing is difficult. It is slowly getting better, but it was also scary in the days and weeks after surgery. Muscle aches in the surgical area have mostly gone away. I've only had to use ibuprofen and some tylenol, though I resisted even taking those until I was miserable. I had some constipation and some diarrhea but I used over the counter stuff for that, too. My doctor and my surgeon both wanted me to be sure to eat enough protein, so I included some powdered casein in my diet, but it gave me terrible constipation, so I just eat food now.\n\n\n\nAltogether, my life is much better now and I'm glad to have had the surgery.

Talking to friends and family it seems impossible to explain. I was undiagnosed for 8 years, was in the Navy at the time. I remember each occurrence vividly, the triggers and everything. When I was diagnosed, it was bittersweet in itself. I was still active duty, Nuclear Electricians Mate, was on my way out serving my last enlistment anyway, but this removed me from duty and that was crushing. I was glad to know what was causing me this pain, but hurt that I felt I would no longer be able to support my team. \n\nMy typical spells, whatever you all like to call them, they happen in random intervals, I am completely normal 99% of the time, no pain nothing out of the ordinary. I do find now I do certain activities with this thing in my mind so that I don't aggravate it, but sometimes that does not matter. When it does come on, sometimes it is like a slow moving force, I can feel this pull next to my throat deep in my neck, radiating heat and pain. Other times its like a whipcrack, just snap and there is this explosion of pain and that spreads up my face and eventually all around my head, but the center is deep in my neck, like someone has reached in through the skin, grabbed right next to my throat and pulled so hard and tight, twisting and tightening. Every sound I make out of my mouth is agony, every attempt to swallow, anything even the saliva in my mouth. When it is set in I do my best to try and relax, lay on my left side with my head on a stack of pillows and towel to catch my drool. Just wait it out, because I have no idea how to make it stop. As for duration, shortest has been about 30 minutes, that was the first time, and the longest, not including this last one, we will get to that next, the longest has been 4 days. And it ends, usually about the same as it comes in, either fast and sudden, not even any residual pain, or slow and deliberate.\n\nSo this last occurrence. This one has had me on edge since I felt it start. Today is the 28th of Oct, and it started on the morning of the 23rd. Now, I would say I am about 98% better. I feel almost normal, but there are certain positions my head and neck can be in that tells me the monster is still trying, maybe just hiding. But during this week, it never fully set in like it did before. Now there was pain, and plenty of it, but when it sets in its a clear 10, this has only been about an 8 at its peak. I have been able to eat this time, this was fortunate. I lost a lot of weight during the multiday events. I think during this one I gained though, in preparation for the thought of not being able to eat, I have eaten every single chance I could. This pain, it felt like all the radiant pain. My jaw hurt, my teeth hurt, my head felt like it was in a vise. My shoulders were tight. And yeah there was pain in my neck, but it was not the sharp blinding pain that I normally feel when it sets in. I have no idea why this was so different. My last occurrence was a month ago, and before that about a year. The intervals are random, but I do thing they are stress related.\n\nI have a doctors appointment next week, will try to get with a neurologist and see about things to do in the future.
