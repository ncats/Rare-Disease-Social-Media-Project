This is long but I'm excited and relieved that I might finally have found some answers to the g.i. nightmare I've been going through. \n\nOnset was ~10 years ago when I was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis (now well-controlledwith Imuran). Attacks begin with foul-tasting burps, followed by frequent watery diarrhea and vomiting, mostly on the first day. Second day I'm exhausted, and may have 1-2 more bouts of vomiting. No fever, but I go through chills and sweats. Bad headache usually hits by the end of the first day. Once I'm hydrated again and able to eat, the headache goes away for an extended period. Last time it was 1.5 weeks of no headache (which is unusual; I wake up so with a headache more often than not). \n\nI've switched gastroenterologists because the last one wasn't really listening to me describe how painful and disruptive the attacks can be. This is not IBS; this is not a nervous stomach; this is not the manifestation of my emotional mind. What this feels like is there is something my body has to get rid of. Like every trace. Evacuate it all. Even when I have just a little bit of water or ginger ale in my stomach has to get it out. The concept of mast cells building up and then dumping all at once sounds like what my body is doing. \n\nAttacks occurred 4-5 times per year until March 2019. (I work at as school and I thought i was getting a stomach virus, then relapsing, twice every semester.) After it hit me in mid- March, it was every 2-3 weeks until mid-June, when frequency dropped off to every 4-5 weeks. Frequency picked back up in February, then dropped off again. Current occurrences are about once per month. \n\nThere's no common trigger; I stopped dairy last summer and accidentally ingested some, then got sick several hours later. So dairy is one. I know stress is one trigger; twice I've been under extreme stress (euthanizing a pet, and a massive ice storm took out our power the week before the election which i was already anxious about). Otherwise, who knows? \n\nAll tests show nothing outside normal limits. I've had CBCs and full chemistry panels twice, stool culture, ultrasound, HIDA scan and blood test for gallbladder, plus a test for autoimmune markers. Everything comes back looking fine. \n\nSince early spring, I've made a few changes. I began taking the herbal solution, Iberogast (made by Bayer). At first only when I felt an attack coming on, but now I take it every night. I resumed taking Amitriptyline -- that's one of the drugs they give for abdominal migraines. (I had some on hand that I was prescribed to prevent morning headaches and I had discontinued taking it because I didn't think it was doing all that much good.) My new gastro doc said that was a \"good Google.\" \ud83d\ude0a I also switched my daily antihistamine from Claritin to Zyrtec. \n\nIn my searching, I came across mastocytosis, and while the only cutaneous symptoms I have are that my face randomly flushes &amp; turns red, and a while back (several years) my back would start itching and even light scratching would raise big red welts. I have frequent headaches and fatigue; depression and anxiety; hypothyroidism; GERD &amp; Barrett's Esophsgus.The biggest thing is the g.i. symptoms nobody can seem to figure out. \n\nSo here I am. My gastro doc is booked through the end of the year, but I have a routine appt with my primary doc next week, so I plan to bring this up with her. Maybe she can order bloodwork? Maybe I need a different kind of specialist? \n\nHas anyone else experienced the gastrointestinal symptoms of Mastocytosis/Mast Cell Activation Syndrome? If so, have you been able to find relief with treatment? I know it's not curable, but it can be managed. Honestly, i think I could learn to live with getting attacks once in a while if I knew what it was. Having a name for it would be huge! \n\nThanks in advance.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mastocytosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_31dh7", "subreddit_subscribers": 148, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intestinal Mastocytosis???", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mastocytosis/comments/jsnwmh/intestinal_mastocytosis/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "KoolKoda", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_rhlgh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1604357219, "domain": "self.mastocytosis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mastocytosis/comments/jmy6jy/worried_i_might_have_this_please_help/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jmy6jy", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/mastocytosis/comments/jmy6jy/worried_i_might_have_this_please_help/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1604357229, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have been experiencing sharp stabbing pains on my skin due to warmer temperatures for a few years now.

I had bad diarrhea, but that was the only symptom besides painful joints. My colon apparently looked weird during colonoscopy but Drs said they don't think it looks like Crohn's OR Ulcerative Colitis. So I feel like I may have been misdiagnosed. I have almost every symptom of mastocytosis since at least that time, nearly 10 years ago. The only symptoms I don't have are skin rashes and low blood pressure. One day I researched my symptoms and was shocked how similar they are to mastocytosis, but I don't have the hallmark symptom of skin rashes. I'm not sure if I have Darrier's sign. I have chronically itchy skin everywhere, throat, and ears and the itching is all day, mild to moderate intensity. I've somewhat gotten used to it and have lived with it for so long it's my normal I guess. But when I think about it I realize it's bizarre. I have joint and muscle aches, headaches, and for about a year now gastric reflux problems at least a couple times a week. I still get diarrhea quite often. I have moderate to severe fatigue all of the time. I know there are more symptoms than that of mastocytosis, but like I said I have them all except the low blood pressure and visible skin issues. The last few months I've had trouble sleeping I've been so itchy. I live in a country where it's quite difficult to get a Drs appointment right now, so I feel like running to the Dr when I'm not having a full blown medical emergency won't be an option currently. I would like to talk to a Dr about this but I'm worried I sound like a hypochondriac. \nTLDR: Have every symptom of mastocytosis but visible skin rashes and low blood pressure.

I had to go to my primary care for a follow up for another reason so I figured I could just ask her. (She is awesome and I absolutely adore her)\n\nHere's where the story turns, my doctor had given birth and was out for maternity leave. It's her practice and there are no other doctors in her office, so they had different doctors filling in. I trusted someone filling in for my doctor would be equally as great. I got to the office, I had labs from every three months for the past year, and I had all my diagnostic/discharge papers from my doctor that gave the diagnosis. I told the doctor about the diagnosis and asked if he could explain it in basic terms so I could understand and he just said, \"I hate when doctors just throw out big words to scare patients. You'll just have to take the medication for a couple more months and you'll be fine.\" And he wouldn't even take a look at any of the paperwork. I felt so embarrassed that I put stock in a diagnosis that really did make sense in my health issue timeline. I felt 10x more lost.\n\nI recently had a follow up with the doctor that originally gave me the diagnosis, she assured me her diagnosis was correct and explained it's a life long condition. She very patiently and thoroughly explained how she came to the diagnosis and put my symptoms into context of the points in my life where doctors just kind of had a question mark. She was honestly kind of shocked the fill-in doctor was so dismissive without looking at the paperwork I brought in.

environmental factors. for years i just dealt w the fact that i had spots and it became a piece of me. at 14 we finally reached a diagnosis from a new doctor out of many who said i have mastocytosis TMEP. it\u2019s a rare version of mastocytosis that is related to allergens i guess. i decided not to go through treatment at that time because i decided i didn\u2019t want a cure. these spots made me who i am and never caused me any true harm. they didn\u2019t hurt or anything they were and still are purely just a visible factor. no one i know has this and i\u2019ve always wanted to reach out to find someone else like me because i don\u2019t know what this diagnosis holds. if anyone has this in this subreddit please lmk i actually have questions. thank you for listening:)", "send_replies":

We are very glad she made it. Now she (our daughter) has one wish: \n\nShe wants earrings like her big sister. We tried directly after swimming for her diploma.  \n\nAnd obviously her body was agitated a lot. \n\nSo we had the tattoo guy, who will shoot the holes in her ears, just try the desinfectant. \n\nInstant reaction on the spot, followed by turning red and pale, but she stayed consious. Our Tattoo guy, mindfull of the situation, and who was very aware we carry emergency medication and was pre-informed of the situation relating to our daughter's problem, and decided he was not going to take the risk, at least not now at this time. \n\nWe appreciate his sincerity and we said we will take a moment during christmas holidays to try again...  \n\nOur daughter is mostly dissapointed not getting her earrings, but the tattoo guy said he'll order her the earrings she really wanted. Which were (non allergic) studs with a pink background and small unicorns, He had pink ones, but the picture was a flamingo. \n\nAs we all likely understand this is a problem. Alcohol cools the skin, is irritating, and as a fermentation product, and a toxin is very much a histamine trigger. Also the fact she was exhausted from the test and the wait afterwards for her actual diploma and all stress leading up to this...\n\nNot to mention forcibly shooting the holes. She normally stays upright with bloodsamples taken for examinations, but these are a single instance of cleaning and are done in the hospital, by specially trained staff with special needles and tubing to prevent overrpiecing her veins when changing vials.\n\n**MY QUESTIONS?**  \n\n1. *Do you (having Cutaneous Mastocytosis/Pigmentosa Utricaria) and did you ever get your ears  pierced or holes for earpins?*  \n2. *Could you desinfect it well?* \n3. *And was this with Alcohol or another desinfectant? (Please state which alternative, and why.)*  \n4. *Would you have any added suggestions for the first 2 weeks ( daily desinfecting and cleaning) ?*\n5. *Do you have any OTHER relevant remarks we should be aware off, relating to placeing earrings (we know about nickel.* \n\n**Added: Not needed for the questions, but might be info of general interest:**\n\n1st, I know, and am very aware, it's dangerous to have someone swim who can react and faint in the water, at any time. I, myself, am an epileptic and used to row single scull (with autorotating selfinflatable vest)... And I do still swim, supervised, but I do swim. Informing a (senior-)lifeguard is also important. \n\nUnderstand her -*being able to swim*\\- is way more important then the risks. If she ever falls into water I (,and we as parents both,) want her to have a fighting chance to get out. We also know if she falls in really cold water, when her medication is low, or she ate stuff which was histamine rich, there is little expectancy of her being able to do so. -*But not teaching her to swim, gives her no chance whatsoever*.-\n\n**So here a bit about our experiences with her swimming lessons in detail:**\n\nAfter 2,5 years she got her first diploma (basic swimming: front stroke 2 lanes, back stroke 2 lanes, breast crawl 15 meters, back crawl meters, floating 10 seconds, basic diving through a hole), and swapping from 60 minute trainings, to another club with 2x weekly 30 minute trainings, and (heavy) additional use of antihistamine and supporting fysiotherapy, to extend her sustain and power to make her strong enough. This 2.5 yrs does include \"Lockdown time due to Covid\" interfering and other measures going on.  Understand this is in a heated pool inside a building with no weathe effects whatsoever. Water temerpature is relatively high (23C?). They also have a official pool for waterpolo, and speedswimming whcih is 5 degrees celcius colder (I think 18C) \n\nThis Swimming instruction was done with permanent supervision from a parent and an instructor (there were allways 3 instructors, 1 teaching, 1 for the group to assist and 1 for added eyes present) from close by with emergency medication being withing reach at all times. \n\nWe have had at least 4 reactions in the past 3 or 4 months, but none so severe needing us to resort to emergency medication. We had 2 active extractions from the water in 2,5 years. We had more feedback with her telling us she fell asleep during a dive into the water once...\n\nShe reacts with dropping of blood pressure, loss of muscle tension when tired and lowering of consiousness (erratic behaviour) or fainting (turning white) as major threat. \n\nMore common symptoms are itching, lightly swollen face, and eyes, occasionally a slight swelling of the throat, most obvious if temperature changes from outside and water are bigger..... \n\n**A bit about her in a community swimming pool (not lessons):**\n\nWhen she goes swimming \"normally\" she wears a lifevest normally at ALL times, it does correct and when she does nothing she'll end up with her face up. \n\nWe generally only go to indoor pools. Mostly because of the constant environment available, causing less triggers.\n\nThe only moment we are not there with her, is when she scales the ladders to the slide as we find the moment she hits the pool again is a far more likely trigger. \n\nWhenever the vest DOES come off (for practice or whatever), she needs permanent supervision. \n\nOur community pool does have automated alarms for people not moving (much) while staying long (60s+) underwater, which is turned off for diving lessons and synchronous swimming only. I myself triggered one once while looking for a pendant from a girl. I prefer not to have that trigger sound for our daughter.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mastocytosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_31dh7", "subreddit_subscribers": 272, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My daughter (2014), got her first swimming diploma.

As an alternative however, I've approached past and present Consultant Psychiatrists - at this level are able to refer into any service regardless of own specialism - that has resulted without surprise, in questioning of my current state of mind. \n\n...and I believe to change GP Surgery now, to build any sense of patient-GP relationship and get to a point of seriously discussing a referral - based upon evidence and fact - will result in my increasing the possible next shock response and risk to life, which I value too much to wait around for. \n\nIn short then, how in your own experience have you motivated a referral? Has this included a particular set of evidence? Have you paid privately? Have you explained your own situation in a certain way that seemed to work? Or any other experience-based suggestion that didn't result on a judgement of mental ill health?\n\nNaturally, I believe, I have been through several round of such sanity questioning, but only return to fact and evidence proving that now, an unknown trigger creates in me a response (captured with photos when physical), is not Anaphylaxis (defined by Consultant since I've never previously had lesions, red marks etc on my torso), the current stability of medication regime (clearly, own responsibility but evidential through dates of prescribing), and on the last occasion, a need to call for emergency medical help as a result of the severity of responses. Thus, leading to the only other disease that exactly fits and was made aware to me by a leading Anaphylaxis organisation. \n\nI hope and trust the above doesn't sound like a help call from a crisis state - a recurrent judgement from others - rather a sense of relief at the possibility for an answer, or not and if not, the possibility for new answers to be made available to me somehow, somewhere and at sometime. \n\nThank you for your time reading, and should you like to respond, thank you for your time taken writing about how things have been or are for you. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you.

Ever since the pandemic has started, I\u2019ve stayed inside, as most of us probably have, just to stay on the safe side. I found it odd that I didn\u2019t receive a shielding letter, but I let it go since I figured it was just for those who either had a terminal illness or were on drugs that severely damaged their immune system. \n\nFast forward to the end of last year when vaccines were being talked about. I was excited, but from the beginning of it all, I knew there was a chance that I couldn\u2019t get it. All of my vaccines in the past had sent me into severe reactions, so you could imagine my joy when people who have SM didn\u2019t seem to have severe reactions to either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca one. \n\nI\u2019m in the UK (NI to be specific), and my group was called for late February/early March. I eagerly waited a phone call from my GP, but it never came. Receptionists shut down questions about vaccines immediately, so I couldn\u2019t get a rough estimate or even an update about where abouts I was on the waiting list. My sister had an appointment for something unrelated, and she asked the doctor what was taking so long (she\u2019s also vulnerable\u2014Asthma and a heart condition). They told her that she should have been contacted (basically she\u2019d been left off the list), so she got an appointment soon after that. \n\nThis then raised more questions\u2014why, even after my sister\u2019s date, had I still not been contacted yet? It was mid-April by this point. NI was progressing through their program very quickly. Think they were at 30-35s at this stage, which was long after the group I was meant to be apart of. My mum phoned up the immunology department and found out that the GP was meant to contact them back in *January* so they could deal with my case. Eventually my GP got a letter sent out at the beginning of May, and I was contacted by my immunology doctor in mid-May. \n\nTurns out Mastocytosis is not part of the vulnerable group. Could someone explain this to me? I have an excess of mast cells in multiple organs, including my lungs. I can\u2019t take medication (can count on one hand which ones I can take), so if I get COVID, I\u2019m screwed. I can\u2019t even use an inhaler or a nebuliser unless it\u2019s just using hot water because I react to what they put in the medicated solution. They\u2019re saying it\u2019s going to take until the end of June to get allergy tested, then end of July/start of August until I get my first dose because I\u2019m not part of the priority group. Private jabs aren\u2019t being given until September. \n\nI have seen a single friend a total of 6 times since last March. I have went to get my haircut when they have been open, and I went to the opticians once. Those occasions have been the total amount of face-to-face socialisation outside of my house in almost 16 months I have had. I know things could be worse, but my mental health is in ruins due to the virus. I honestly feel forgotten about, both by the general public and my doctors. Everyone is getting on with their life here, but I\u2019m stuck inside for at least another couple of months. My non-compromised friends have gotten the first vaccine, and although I\u2019m happy for them, it still hurts to see because they have an immune system that would handle COVID if they got it, and if they got a severe case, they could be given medical help without the risk of a reaction. \n\nI know this rant is a little embarrassing to post here, but there\u2019s no one I can really talk to about it that understands. People tell me \u201cit\u2019s only another couple of months\u201d, but after 16 months it really feels like \u201ca couple more\u201d is the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. \n\nHas anyone else been told the same thing? Or are my doctors underestimating the severity of Mastocytosis? I ask since this has happened a few times in the past, plus the doctor I had the appointment with was new.

Sleeping 4 to 6 hours, interrupted.     \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nQ3 2015 have been civilian er twice for abdomal pain.    \n\nQ2 2016 second colonoscopy, they went in looking for weird. Lots of biopsies. Mentioned sleep issues, they put me under for hour longer for rim sleep. It was needed!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nQ2 2016 2nd colonoscopy biopsies showed increased mast cells throughout entire digestive track including stomach and esophagus.    \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHave been in emergency room 14 times for severe pain and dehydration. Typically get 2 bags of iv fluids, 1 or 2 shots morphine for extreme gut pains, anti nausea. Baseline pain is 5 of 10 everything hurts to digest. No longer consume alcohol. Sleep 3.5 to 5 hours a night. weight is involuntarily down to low 140s at 6 foot 3. Hunger pains is folds less, then digesting pain. Hunger sensation is gone, weight vs height and body mass equals malnourished me...shocking /s\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWas released from ER on Thursday, Here's the new Rx I'm taking in addition to meds above... :/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n  * ondansetron hcl *nausea pill*\n  * Paroxetine hcl *depression, ssri, I think*\n  * oxycodone *pain, takes edge off of gut pain, Tylenol portion is making liver sore* (try to limit use of these)\n  * Cromolyn Sodium Oral ampules 100mg/5ml (2) 10ml 4/day *for systemic mastocytosis*\n      __looking for tips on travelling with this stuff, comes in foil pouch, and has weird temp range...thinking a chilled container...?__\n  * Montelukast na *asthma med, blankets histamine receptors*  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWithout the above I would be perfectly comfortable in a hospital bed on the cardiac floor. And I was for 4 days prior to these meds, blood pressure was 77/55, peed only 2 to 3 ounces first 3 days, 3 bags of iv fluid each day...received blood thinners while laid up in bed. If I have cardiac arrest, my wish is to die, living will is on record with medical facilities. I use same facilities and doctors since this is a newer illness and uncommon. Supposably i can expect a few decades of life, if its not worsening. I assume a 3rd colonoscopy is in my near future again.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point, I hope this is something unique to me, and not something dormant in my fellow soldiers. Have finances straight to buy a house, I hope I get to.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSigns to look out for, as disease progresses, __diarrhea that looks like coffee grounds is digested blood, seek ER services__ or __fresh blood in contents of vomit__ I only see blood after clearing throat from puking acid/food. Also rear molars are suffering from acid damage. Occasional audible pop is enamel coming off while eating. Have also broken two crowns, no point in fixing them yet.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHaven't worked last 6 weeks trying to get 100% disability. Only bringing in a few hundreds calories and burning thousands off each day has finally caught up to me. Don't have enough energy to do much of anything. I miss the since of accomplishment from working, been gardening on cooler temp days. This mastocytosis sucks, IBS sounds better.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThings to add:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n  * 24hour pee/ pee in acid collection\n  * Many iterations of blood work panels, std testing\n  * Dumping Syndrome\n  * Stool Samples (3 or 4 of these, my dog's shit smell better....then the nonsense coming from me)\n  * Nuclear Medicine[NM], Gastric Emptying Study 4hr\n  * NM measure between kidney and something\n  * Cdef one episode and those frozen poo pills\n  * MRI and CAT scans\n  * chest xrays\n  * colonoscopy prep and what to expect from procedure (1x VA, 1x by Civilian Doctor) and diferences in care provided.\n  * congressional hearings to stop getting bent over and fucked by the va medical approval board\n  * use of insurance for service connected problems, va hospital was too far from where I was living.\n  * Civilian GI ER doc, sent sample of blood while experiencing anaphalytic shock to labs, havent heard back yet.\n  * Loss of bathroom control w/o medication.\n  * Guts jolting  (hitting pot hole/reflector in car is painful)\n  * Loss of OTC pain medication\n  * Probiotics/extracts/herbs/aloe plant\n  * Limitation of bathroom problems\n  * Expand on diets tried and add hyperlink\n  * alternative medicines like acupuncture \n  * The fear of \"sharting\" is a big concern\n  * dehydration balance between bathroom and medicines \n  * altering food intake, at max dosage for main medications, to relieve symptoms\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Typed on my Samsung Note 7 IED^ (when did something catching fire and smoking equal an explosion?)* __attempt at formatting will add additional information soon__ ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mastocytosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_31dh7", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Iraq War Veteran, Systemic Mastocytosis, no specific food/environmental factors.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mastocytosis/comments/57q4f3/iraq_war_veteran_systemic_mastocytosis_no/"}, {"author": "nikki_f_ruiz", "author_created_utc": 1471360285, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_10klid", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1474913745, "domain": "self.mastocytosis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mastocytosis/comments/54m0lq/i_guess_ill_be_the_first_post/", "gilded": 0, "id": "54m0lq", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/mastocytosis/comments/54m0lq/i_guess_ill_be_the_first_post/", "retrieved_on": 1476454044, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi everyone!
