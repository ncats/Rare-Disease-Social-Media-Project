Or maybe it'll just bring back memories for those that have had it too.\n\nWhen I was \\~9 I started telling my parents that my leg hurt. My mom dismissed it as growing pains for a while, but as I started to limp and keep complaining she eventually took me to the doctor. The pediatrician didn't know what exactly the issue was so I was referred to a specialist. The specialist took some x-rays and that was when they suspected Perthes. I was then referred to a Perthes specialist at the local children's hospital where the diagnosis was confirmed and treatment began.\n\nI was 10 when I got surgery. This was in 1999 so not sure how much has changed since then, but my surgery was not as intense as some Perthes cases are. They put screws in my hip and put my whole right leg in a body cast. I was in the cast for about 2 months. As a kid it wasn't the end of the world and I was pretty optimistic about everything. It hurt of course, but if that was going to make things better, that's worth it. \n\nWhen I got home I was set up on the couch, where I spent the next couple months, much to the annoyance of my 3 brothers who couldn't sit there anymore. Lots of people brought me things to stay entertained, Lego sets, N64 games etc. Where things weren't so fun was bowel movements. Pain killers do a number on you so I wasn't able to go for a while. I'll spare you the details, but when it finally happened it was a very unpleasant experience both me and my mom remember to this day! Going to the actual bathroom in a body cast wasn't possible for at least 2-4 weeks which added to the fun. Eventually I was able to hobble around on my walker and even spent a lot of time doing jigsaw puzzles. Since I was going to miss a ton of school (which could have made me have to repeat 4th grade) my teacher stopped by once a week to keep me in the loop and not let me fall behind. I was able to go into school with my mom a few times while I was in my cast. My class got to sign it, as did family etc. \n\nEventually I was in the cast long enough and went back to the hospital to have it removed. One of the best things about getting it off would be being able to sit in the car again. Since I was casted into a laying down position they had to put a parachuting harness on me and strap me into the backseat that way. Not a very fun time for the hour long drive to the hospital. Anyway, I have the cast removed and screws taken out. My mom actually kept the cast for YEARS after it was removed. I finally convinced her to get rid of it only 3-5 years ago. From there I need physical therapy to help build my strength up again.\n\nPhysical therapy was rough. Just lifting my right leg was difficult. I did all the exercises you read about though so I won't bore you with that. After about 6 months I was able to start bearing a little weight on my leg (while using crutches still). I got better and better and after about a year and a half I didn't need crutches anymore. I could walk and even run. I had to take it easy though because it would hurt if I did too much. In 6-7th grades I was exempt from certain gym activities because of the additional strain on my hip. My range of motion increased, but it never got back to the same level as my good hip and still isn't as flexible.\n\nBy high school I was recovered enough to participate in regular activities. I was in the marching band, did musicals, played ultimate frisbee, and was outside with my brothers often. I rode my bike all the time in college as well. When I graduated and moved out I started playing rec league ice hockey and softball as well. I still play ice hockey every week (I'm 31 now). I used to run 5ks every now and then but I've given that up because running is what hurts the worst. \n\nI was able to keep active, but my right leg was/is still an inch shorter than the left, so that caused pain pretty frequently. I've had shoe lifts at different points in my life to help with that. They're fine when you're just walking, but harder to work with when wearing something other than regular shoes/sneakers. It wouldn't work with flip flops in the summer, or fit well in my hockey skates or cleats. \n\nOverall I've lived a pretty normal life in my 20+ years with Perthes and have been able to do most of the things I would have without it. People will occasionally notice my limp and ask if I'm ok though. And it's not as if I'm completely normal, my hip will have flare ups of shooting and burning pain, but it's generally pretty manageable. I have been having more soreness lately, but still think I've got at least a good 5-10 years left before arthritis really sets in and makes me need a hip replacement.\n\nHope that's helpful for someone and/or a good trip down memory lane for others!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Perthes", "subreddit_id": "t5_3jwjv", "subreddit_subscribers": 19, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Perthes Story", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Perthes/comments/hmvp5o/my_perthes_story/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Storm6789", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_58dxy2bv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1592098505, "domain": "self.Perthes", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Perthes/comments/h8kja2/pregnancy/", "gildings": {}, "id": "h8kja2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Perthes/comments/h8kja2/pregnancy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1592113721, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hey guys so I've had perthes since I was 8-10 and I am now 21 and still have it.

I am a man of 42 and was diagnosed at the age of 5. The right hip was affected and I began to limp. After this I had to stay 2 months and bed, with the leg elevated. This was not enough and it was decided to have osteotomy surgery . In this type of procedure, the bone is cut and repositioned to keep the femoral head snug within the acetabulum. This alignment is kept in place with screws and plates, which will be removed after the healed stage of the disease.\n\nThe recovery went pretty well as far as I can remember. Fast forward to 2010, I was starting to have trouble with my knee. I had previously put a 1cm increment in my shoe, to get rid of the leg length difference of 12mm because I had back problems. I went to see an orthopedist who told me to get used to the pain and leave it at that. Coincidentally, I got a tip from a colleague who was training for a 100km walk that stretching the hip and knee could help a lot with the pain. This indeed turned out to be the case, and the pain disappeared. 5 years later I started running, first 300km per year, then 500, until now just under 1200km. I do not suffer from stiff hips or knees, my body has adapted well. The only nutritional supplement I take is Curcudyn Forte, a mixture of Turmeric and Boswelia. I hope to have inspired people that you should not give up hope and that a full recovery is indeed possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xngti8d3d9581.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaeaa246a478c41e7c66e0a1de131298c3c2116a", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Perthes", "subreddit_id": "t5_3jwjv", "subreddit_subscribers": 84, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/iL26WTdridylxDRtf_zc3gDZVe6QAsp6j4vfkPoyHGU.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "A story of hope", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Perthes/comments/rf9on7/a_story_of_hope/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Rwh221", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3qj56fbp", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1638339043, "domain": "self.Perthes", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Perthes/comments/r681v3/hey_everyone/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r681v3", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Perthes/comments/r681v3/hey_everyone/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1638339054, "score": 1, "selftext": "I of course have had perthes since birth.

Sciatica pains from my lower back to my left ankle are persistent.\n\nI can honestly say I\u2019m worried about the hip replacement.
