The first is my wife and I's son.  He has selective mutism and doesn't talk very often even at home.  About a year ago, we kinda got shoved into adopting a family friend's kid after they passed away.  He's about 8 months younger than our son.  (For brevity's sake we'll call the oldest son Connor and the younger one John).  They always got along before we adopted John and now they get along even better.  However, since they've been living together they've become almost inseparable.  However about 4 months ago John has started talking **for** Connor, and I don't mean the typical little kid \"He says I can have his dessert\" type thing but like \"Connor's cold, can you get another blanket down from the closet\" type talking.\n\nWe'd been taking Connor to a therapist and working on his SM and he'd been slowly getting better but now he's talking even less than usual.  Half the time when we ask Connor a question, John will respond.  For example, Wife: Connor do you want ketchup?  John: No he's good, I'd like some though please.  It's like this for just about every question directed towards Connor.  Besides that they're like two peas in a pod, playing and goofing around and watching cartoons, everything normal brothers do together, except one of them doesn't talk.  \n\nIt's honestly kinda unnerving how John seems to know exactly what Connor is thinking and now the school thinks the next best step is to put them in separate classrooms, basically to try and force Connor to start talking in class again.  The therapist thinks that this will only cause Connor more anxiety, but also agrees that as long as Connor continues to rely on John to talk for him he will continue to fall behind in his speech.\n\nHas anyone else ever had a kid with SM that acted like this?  Or siblings that did something similar?  How did you get them to stop while also nurturing the relationship?  My wife and I are just at a loss as to what to do next.

Thrown down stairs, tripped over, spat on, slapped with steel rulers, shoved, laughed at, teased, had things stolen off me. This began as young as playgroup, which meant over the course of time I eventually got diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but not SM. In school, around the age of 8 I began to experience trouble with speaking in class. It wasn't typical issues, such as being afraid of talking in front of a crowd, but whenever someone tried to talk to me, I wouldn't be able to get a single word out. It feels like my vocal chords are sewn shut, or my lips have been torn off, or my tongue has been cut in half, because no matter how much I want to speak I can't. It has always been an issue. I can't talk in class, even in college I can't speak, which means I've never been able to make friends or mix with peers as speaking is difficult. \n\nThe only thing I'm able to do is write on a whiteboard, but that alone is humiliating. Whenever I attempt to speak, it only comes out as a small croak or harsh whisper. I can't raise my voice, otherwise I start to feel uncomfortable. It's not just the inability to speak that troubles me, I become frozen. I can't move so easily, everything about me is robotic and uncomfortable. Walking becomes difficult, moving becomes difficult. \n\nMost of the time, in class, over the last 12 years, has been me glued to a chair in the corner of the room unable to move or speak. If I wanted, for example, a new pencil, I couldn't get out of my seat to go grab one. I was stuck. Despite how much I wanted to move, I was stuck. My head goes blank, I find myself staring into space. Can't ask anyone for help, can't raise my hand. \n\nAnd it has overlapped into my everyday life, too. When I'm out in public, I can't speak and get the same physical response. It's like the words are stuck on my tongue and can't come out. Even when I've tried forcing this. So whenever I'm out with the family, my parents, siblings, I'm unable to speak to them as long as I'm in public. \n\nThis all changes once I'm in a quiet area, with no people, say for instance a park bench far out of the way. Or at home. In the car. Sitting at a table in the corner of a caf\u00e9. Once I'm out of a public place, talking becomes easy and it frustrates me to no end. I start wondering why I can't speak like this in public, but only at home. Why can't I raise my voice and be normal without issue? \n\nThis has destroyed my social life. Throughout school, I've had no friends. I've been isolated at home, it's gotten to the point where I'm nearly housebound. The impression people have on me, is a quiet kid who doesn't have a personality. I'm easily forgotten about, and left out of group discussions. And it hurts, as there are people I'd love to get to know, if only my head didn't continue to f\\*ck me over.\n\nI've tried getting this issue looked at before, only to be told by therapists that I shouldn't self-diagnose. I'm not sure what it's like where you are, but for me they're not so quick to diagnose you with anything, and usually issues are overlooked as they administer you anti-depressants to get you off their list. \n\nI've tried getting people to understand, but they dismiss it as typical shyness. I wish it were, because then I could get over it alone. I feel like it's stunted my development into the real world, because I haven't been able to form connections with others. Work hasn't been easy, holding down part-time jobs hasn't been easy as there is a lot of clich\u00e9-attitude here, which means if you aren't apart of the picture you are given a hard time. \n\nIt's got me spiralling downwards. Doesn't help the fact I am diagnosed with moderate depression, which means everything piles up.

But I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that I had it. I have, however, been diagnosed with severe social phobia and agoraphobia and have had panic attacks since I was very young.\n\nI am currently 25 years old and while I am now almost completely recovered, I spent the majority of my life (until I was around 22) almost completely incapable of speaking to anyone but immediate family members and a very very small group of friends. \n\nIt started before I can even remember, my mom told me that even when I was 2 and 3 I would refuse to communicate with anyone I wasn\u2019t familiar with. It only got worse as I got older. My mom spoke with multiple pediatricians and they always told her the same thing. I was just \u201cpainfully shy\u201d and I would grow out of it, she needed to encourage me to \u201cuse my voice\u201d and refuse to speak for me, it would go away as I built confidence. That obviously never worked though. \n\nWhen I was in school I would do anything I could to avoid speaking or having attention drawn to me. I had several accidents in elementary school because I couldn\u2019t bring myself to ask to use the restroom.\n\nWe would be at a restaurant and I would try to tell my mom what I wanted. She would give me the \u201cuse your voice\u201d prompt, and it always went the same way. I would open my mouth to say something and nothing would come out, I really really tried but it was always like the words got caught it my chest and refused to come out. Every time I eventually started to tear up because I really did want to speak for myself but I just couldn\u2019t. My mom would end up ordering for me and more often than not she would snap at me for not just telling them myself. \n\nThe thing is, I never even thought about selective mutism. I had never looked into it and assumed it meant that you just didn\u2019t want to talk to some people, so you didn\u2019t. I physically couldn\u2019t do it. After I looked into it I realized that this had been my problem all along, and I can\u2019t help but feel angry. I\u2019m not really mad at my mom, she just did what she was told she should do by multiple medical professionals. \n\nI\u2019m mad at the doctors who never recommended therapy. I\u2019m mad at my teachers for not realizing that there was a problem and telling my parents that I was \u201cmanipulative\u201d and \u201cattention seeking\u201d.  I\u2019m mad because instead of getting the help that I needed, I was just told to \u201cSpeak up\u201d.  I\u2019m mad because I had to drop out of high school at 15 because I couldn\u2019t handle it. I\u2019m mad because I never even had a chance to have a normal life because everyone in my life was so convinced that I was just shy or stubborn or attention seeking that they never even tried to see what the problem was.\n\nI never went through any kind of treatment. When I was nineteen I forced myself to get a customer service job, and with a lot of patience from my coworkers, I slowly started getting more  comfortable communicating with others.\n\nLike I said, I\u2019m now for the most part recovered.

I\u2019m the creator of [https://neurodiverse.world/](https://neurodiverse.world/).\n\nI\u2019m a diagnosed Aspie, and I\u2019ve been weird all my life. It has been difficult for the new people in my life to get past the weird vibe that I can put out, but once they get to know me, we become really good friends. I might be weird, but I'm awesome. I\u2019ve been asked \u201cWhere on earth did you come from?\u201d and \u201cWhere can I find more people like you?\u201d.\n\nThose are both really good questions, and thinking about it more, besides sending people to Reddit, I wasn\u2019t sure where one could meet more people like me. Hell, I wasn\u2019t even sure myself. I thought, \u201cHow cool would it be to have a place where we (neurodiverse peoples) could search for one another based on special interest, or other commonality? A place for us to gather and have like-minded conversations, and have it have a little more of a \u201cconnected\u201d feeling than Reddit, which is the only place I\u2019ve seen the neurodiverse gather.\u201d\n\nPerhaps I just don\u2019t know where to go. But That\u2019s ok. I started this site and I really hope it will take off.\n\nThe goal is to be inclusive, and I will never charge for membership. We may sell tshirts one day, but never memberships. I will not sell any data from this site either. I'm not looking to make money off this, I'm looking for an online community for people like me.\n\nThe site is based off a dating site format, so we can have profiles and search for one another. Maybe we\u2019ll find good conversation. Maybe we\u2019ll find friends. Maybe some will find romance. I can dream\u2026.\n\nSo two things - 1.) it would be great if you would join me there. and 2.) I'm looking for feedback. I want to make it as inclusive for all the neurodiverse, and I'm aware that my point of view is not complete enough to make it good by myself. The goal is to be there place where everyone feels accepted, not judged, and free to be themselves. Please tell me how I can make it better.\n\nP.S. Please be kind - the site is super new and there will be issues. Also, it's literally just me - I don't have a \"team\" to help develop and/or test.\n\nThank you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 1340, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "help me be inclusive to all neurodiverse", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565732156, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/cnrc93/help_me_be_inclusive_to_all_neurodiverse/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "classcass717", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_18qd3klj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565213077, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/cnbwf6/advice_for_parent_of_child_diagnoses_with_sm/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cnbwf6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/cnbwf6/advice_for_parent_of_child_diagnoses_with_sm/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565213078, "score": 7, "selftext": "I first want to say how glad I was to find this subreddit.

I always thought I was the only person with this problem, but it turns out there are many other people!\nSo I will share my story. I am a 15 year old female, I\u2019m not diagnosed but I strongly believe I have been suffering from SM my whole life. Ever since I started school, I have been struggling a lot to communicate with anyone outside of my family. When I started kindergarten, I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone. I was bullied a lot and couldn\u2019t tell them to stop, so I often took out my anger in the wrong ways, like throwing toys at people, or crying. My teacher had a meeting with my parents and suggested I get treatment at school (you know, put me with the kids who have disabilities), but my parents didn\u2019t believe I had any disability because I was talking fine at home. So they refused. As I grew up, I made one friend in first grade. She was the only kid from grade 1-5 that I was completely comfortable talking to. Her presence helped me so much. My SM was improved a lot with her as my friend, and I was able to talk to other kids and to the teacher, though I was still shy and quiet. When I got to grade 6, she got too busy with her other friends and stopped talking to me. That\u2019s when I realized she really doesn\u2019t understand me, she just thought I was a little shy and now wanted more talkative friends. \nEverything started going downhill since then. I was all alone at school. My SM became as worse as it was in kindergarten. I was getting bullied again. Everyone thought I was weird and disabled. There were these two girls who treated me like I was completely dumb, but I couldn\u2019t tell them to stop. School became so bad for me, and I began to skip school a lot. I stopped participating in gym because somehow, I got a phobia of sports balls at the same time. I stopped participating in music class because the teacher never taught me how to play the flute properly, and I was embarrassed to play in front of everyone. My music teacher was mean to me and told me I\u2019m being immature and disrespectful. It went to the point where I wrote a suicide note to my teacher, and they contacted my family, and it was a big mess. My family was really upset that I felt this way, because they always tried to keep me happy. My parents are the best and I don\u2019t blame them for being angry.\nBut I am still angry at myself for being like this. I\u2019m angry at myself for being born like this, never being able to do what the other kids did. When I started high school, the new environment helped me socialize more. However, at this point of time, I\u2019m forcing myself to speak. I don\u2019t have a choice anymore because my grades depend on my communication, so I just push myself to talk no matter how hard it is. I made a buddy in one of my classes, and speaking to her is mostly comfortable. But we were only friends in that class, so it was just temporary friendship.\nAnyways, that is my story. If anyone has advice on how to treat myself, it would be greatly appreciated.

This was at the same time that I got into a relationship with my boyfriend who couldn't speak English.\n\nNow, he learned English, and I brushed up on my Thai very quickly. However, I also realized that SPEAKING Thai was very difficult for me. When confronted with a situation when I should speak Thai, I would have the words in my head and on the tip of my tongue, but I could not force myself to speak them. \n\nI could speak to Google so that it could transliterate what I was saying in to text, and I could speak to myself. But the moment somebody asked me a question and expected a response in Thai, I lost the ability to speak. \n\nThis doesn't affect me at all in English. In fact I'm actually a very confident speaker, and do a lot of public speaking. \n\nI'm going to start learning in Thai language school soon. I met up with the school last week and they asked me a question in Thai to test my knpwledge. I understood them, but that dreaded feeling came up and I couldn't respond.

I'm a 'dreamer' who holds extremely high expectations of certain situations and am easily disappointed by the reality, and as a result I've started to shut myself out from other people and avoiding social situations.\n\nEarlier this year, I lost my voice for a few days and had to resort to writing to communicate with people. Ironically, I felt far more free then than before. I've noticed that for the past few months, I've started to talk less and less when possible. It's not really SM, because it's voluntary and I can talk when I really need to, so maybe you'd call me simply antisocial, but I always felt afraid of speaking to other people and wished I could just not say anything. And now I guess I'm starting to act on that.\n\nSo I wanted to know if there are any *actual* SMs who don't mind not being able to speak, and instead welcome it as a necessary part of their lives.

feel like no one understands. so i wanted to share my story about how it ruined my life. people who can easily talk don\u2019t understand that you can\u2019t just choose to talk, but you are physically incapable of speaking around certain people or situations. ever since i was young, i didn\u2019t speak to my cousins, grandparents, dad, brother, strangers, etc. but it\u2019s weird because i felt comfortable around my other siblings and my mom. it was like i was a whole different person around them. my mom sent me to many counsellors to get me to talk more because she was worried about the fact i was still mute by the age of 10. when you\u2019re a little kid, it\u2019s cute and you\u2019re just called \u201cshy\u201d, but when you get older into your teens years, it isn\u2019t so cute anymore. the first few times i went to a counselor, it wasn\u2019t very effective, and i refused to open up and talk to people. i wished i could speak but i felt like my voice was trapped inside someone who wanted to talk. i realized around the age of 11 that i needed to change. so my mom sent me back to counseling and i worked on various activities to open up a bit. i gradually started ordering my own food at restaurants, and i gradually spoke to different family members. i eventually started talking to everyone in my family. now at 15, i still don\u2019t speak to my dad because he\u2019s lost my trust. but this also means that i can\u2019t talk to his side or the family, or to any strangers when i\u2019m with my dad. i feel really conflicted and like i\u2019m being rude when i just don\u2019t answer someone\u2019s question because i\u2019m physically unable to. when i get around large groups, i find it hard to add to conversations or even say anything. sometimes during school presentations, i think i\u2019m being loud enough, but everyone tells me to speak up. i think with selective mutism comes a bit of volume control issues. everyone tells me i talk really quiet when i think i\u2019m speaking loud. anyways, i just wanted to share this because it has really made it hard for me to live a normal life and be a normal kid. people at school make fun of me a lot for being quiet and it makes me really sad. and people think it\u2019s funny but they don\u2019t understand how hard it is to not talk. i know this is a really long post but i\u2019ve felt alone

I\u2019ve been struggling lately because we just graduated high school. I\u2019ve been feeling kind of sad and frustrated (and even a little jealous) because I found out he talks to friends outside of school from volunteering and soccer. He\u2019s told me before that he does want to start speaking to me but probably wont because he feels comfortable in our current situation and usually doesn\u2019t speak outside of his home unless if he has no other choice. He usually only speaks to people outside of his family if they are strangers to him. I sometimes feel like we haven\u2019t been able to connect on a deeper level due to his SM but I also try to understand him as best as I can. I would really like for him to be able to talk to me in person one day but I know he said he probably wont. Honestly, for the most part, after ten years I\u2019ve accepted that he wont talk to me, but once I heard his laugh in a video his friend posted. After that it kind of hit me that a small part of me still really wishes that we could speak to one another in person.

I was always told I was \"shy.\" But that never sat with me well. I actually learnt about selective mutism about two years ago when I worked with a group of children. There was one child who would not speak at all to the adults, only to the kids. It reminded me so much of myself at that age. I guess I decided to look it up and stumbled upon selective mutism. \n\nFinally a name that fit with my experience. \n\nI am not sure when I first became selectively mute but I suspect it was quite early on. My mom said even as a baby I never cried. However, I had quite a traumatic first few years of life. So I've always suspected that the selective mutism stemmed from that. As all the symptoms I displayed align with a child who experienced trauma. \n\nAs a young child I dont think my selective mutism effected me much. I would talk to my peers and my teachers for the most part. However, it always comes out the most around supervisors or people of power. But I would say I mostly did not talk 99% of the time. And at times I just could not speak. No matter how hard I tried to will myself to.\n\nHowever, I can remember coming home and I would throw gigantic tantrums. Like hours and hours of crying and screaming. I can remember being so angry for absolutely no reason. I suspect this is in relation to the trauma but I would be curious to know if anyone else experienced this as well. \n\nIt was when I was a teenager where it really would effect me. It was embarassing, let's me frank. I can remember one time in particular where someone was talking to me and I could not talk back. I wanted to but I just could not. I hid behind my mom (I was taller than her at this point). All i could think was how embarrassing it was and rude that i couldnt even say one single thing. \n\nAround 16-17 I began to grow out of selective mutism. I cant say I did anything to start this process. I think getting my first job in customer service really helped though. After this I began to do things that scared me, a lot. I also began university and got my degree in social work of all things. \n\nI am actually quite personable now. I still feel i am not articulate. I especially find it hard to keep a conversation when I'm not feeling well. \n\nWhere I still feel it the most? Is when I'm talking to authority or my supervisor. I'm not sure how it \"felt\" as a child but when it comes on now it feels like a large lump in my throat. When I push past it and talk I get on the verge of tears or my voice is shaky. Sometimes it coinsides with the situation but more often than not it comes out of nowhere. I feel embarrassed to explain that yes I'm on the verge of tears but I promise I am okay. \nLuckily I have amazing coworkers.

Even though it isn\u2019t explicitly stated that she has SM it\u2019s possible to assume she does, as the character has a social anxiety disorder and is unable to talk to others in certain situations! Here\u2019s the plot:\n\nOn her first day attending the elite Itan Private High School, the main setting of the story, Shouko Komi immediately receives an overwhelming surge in popularity due to the unprecedented, stoic beauty and refined elegance her classmates perceive her to possess. However, only Hitohito Tadano, an exceedingly average schoolboy assigned to the seat next to hers, is able to have the opportunity to discover that, behind her bish\u014djo appearance, Komi has serious issues in communicating with others. Tadano sets out to help Komi on her quest to find 100 friends.\n\nAn absolute beauty to anyone, Shouko Komi in reality suffers from extreme social anxiety and communication problems, making her largely unable to talk to others. However, her attractiveness and stoic appearance (which in itself results from her anxiety) is perceived as refined class, making her highly popular while preventing people from actually getting to know her. Komi's first conversation with Tadano is over a blackboard, and she uses a notebook to convey her feelings through writing. Despite this, she is still capable of verbal conversation over a cell phone. Her dream is to overcome her communication problems and make 100 friends.\n\nThis manga is ongoing and currently has 215 chapters.

The post is actually about the [Behaviourally Inhibited](https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Inhibited+Temperament) temperament but my daughter also fits the description of [Selective Mutism](https://selectivemutismcenter.org/whatisselectivemutism/), but is too young to be diagnosed with anxiety.\n\n**Does anyone have information sources that focus on very young children and prevention of anxiety (including selective mutism) or the BI temperament?** \n\nMy daughter is 22 months old and has exhibited the BI temperament since approximately 3 months of age. I have a long list of behaviours over her life that indicate this temperament and am currently on a wait list to discuss this with a child psychologist (the wait list I am on is for the office that includes Dr. Annie Simpson, a recommended psychologist on the SM Association website). After the 15 minute in-take phone call, the psychologist (one who also specializes in SM and runs and SM summer camp) said that based on the few examples I provided, my daughter is likely \"highly\" inhibited, but that they will not diagnose SM (or any anxiety disorder) in such a young child, especially one that is mostly pre-verbal. The concern about a severe BI temperament is that these kids have a [4 times greater risk of developing anxiety](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/11/bashful). So, my search for information is about **how to best support her in life such that she does not develop anxiety**.\n\nThe difficulties I am struggling with:\n\n1. my daughter is young and most articles prescribe treatments (like CBT) for children &gt;= 3 years (but more typically for school-aged children)\n2. inhibited, shy and introverted are temperaments and I don't think they are necessarily bad (I identify as all 3). I do not want to \"fix\" her or change who she is, but guide her to maintain good mental health and not develop anxiety (I do not have anxiety, but did experience \"triggered\" anxiety during my pregnancy, so I know what anxiety feels like and I don't want her to experience it). Many articles label shyness and inhibition as negative traits to be fixed. \n3. I find it difficult (given my temperament!) to communicate to others (parents at the park, for example) about why my child is behaving the way she is (suddenly bursting into tears if they look at her, going into a \"freeze\" state). Some articles say that you should not label your child as \"shy\" because then they will be shy. But, it's hard to talk to other parents about this without using some sort of synonymous word. And frankly, I don't think being shy is bad, nor something you can necessarily change (i.e. it is a stable temperament). Anyway, I would love to hear any **suggestions about how to approach discussing this topic with basic strangers at the park in front of my child who I don't want to make feel bad about her reactions**. So far, I often just pick up my child and offer soothing words to her and walk away and avoid the whole situation of discussing it with others, but I am finding that as she gets older, this is becoming more difficult as other parents think that kids should be \"social\" and able to play without the parent right there. I know I look like a helicopter parent, even though I feel confident that I am providing appropriate scaffolding and support to my child.\n\nSome articles on the subject of BI temperament:\n\n[Link between behavioral inhibition and social anxiety](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-behavioral-inhibition-3024525)\n\n&gt;encourage him or her to be independent and give him or her the opportunity to problem-solve for himself or herself\n\n[Behavioral Inhibition as a childhood predictor of social anxiety, Part 1](https://akfsa.org/research/behavioral-inhibition-as-a-childhood-predictor-of-social-anxiety-part-1/)\n\n&gt;caregiving style that encourages children to develop independence and confidence may help children reduce their distress in new social environments\n\n[The highly sensitive child and behavioral inhibition](https://skillsforaction.com/highly-sensitive-child)\n\n&gt;Children who have been encouraged to explore, take risks and take on challenges develop better coping skills and learn to moderate their tendency to withdraw or avoid situations they perceive to be threatening. A broad range of experience also means that the young child is faced with fewer unfamiliar\u00a0situations and is better at predicting what will happen next.\n\n[Inhibited children become anxious adults](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/04/140417155901.htm)\n\n&gt;Kids aren't yet anxious, but can have the temperament that may predispose them to become anxious", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 747, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Possible SM in toddler with an inhibited temperament", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559616093, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/bslgaw/possible_sm_in_toddler_with_an_inhibited/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "P00ld3ad", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3haoejov", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1558649326, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/bs8zq4/how_would_you_describe_what_sm_feels_like/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bs8zq4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/bs8zq4/how_would_you_describe_what_sm_feels_like/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1558649327, "score": 4, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 744, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How would you describe what SM feels like?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559609572, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/bs8zq4/how_would_you_describe_what_sm_feels_like/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "theweirdquietgirl", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3hrtyv3s", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1558594960, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/brzswo/howwhen_did_yours_start/", "gildings": {}, "id": "brzswo", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/brzswo/howwhen_did_yours_start/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1558594961, "score": 9, "selftext": "I was a toddler and had apparently previously been vocal and normal when I suddenly completely stopped talking to my dad.

Throughout the years, my teachers' most common complaint to my parents was that I never talked unless it was in a one-on-one setting after class. \n\nNow I exhibit more general and social anxiety, though I still have situations where I lose my words. \n\nThough it's possible I'm overthinking this and may just in fact be shy!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 737, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just learned about selective mutism today", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559596332, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/brk1u4/just_learned_about_selective_mutism_today/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "maxipadsforeveryone", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2jarxy71", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1558418017, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/br6obz/can_not_having_friends_drive_me_insane/", "gildings": {}, "id": "br6obz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/br6obz/can_not_having_friends_drive_me_insane/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1558418017, "score": 4, "selftext": "Ok so this isn\u2019t directly about selective mutism but it\u2019s from it.

I have a final presentation for my English class, where I have to present my research for a project I've been working on since January.  I currently have a D in the class, so if I don't do well in this presentation, I won't graduate. I was originally going to opt-out, as I usually do, but she was adamant this time. She doesn't ask that I talk in front of everyone, but that I at least have a recording or method of verbal delivery of my content. I've just never given a presentation on my own before, and I'm very embarrassed about my topic for my project, so I'm getting a ton of anxiety thinking about the presentation.\n\nSide note: I'm pretty sure my teacher is making me do the presentation because she doesn't like me. In the first semester of the year, she would go out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and that I didn't do anything that might induce anxiety. At the time, that made me feel comfortable and I often also put in extra effort for my work. I had an A in the class. January came around and I was going strong until I was suddenly hit by a truckload of anxiety (I'd say depression, but I have no diagnosis, so I'll just say I lost all motivation and just wasn't myself). My teacher started greeting me with less enthusiasm, and I stopped doing work. By mid-March I pretty much did nothing at school. I barely managed to get by in other classes, but my English teacher's workload proved to be too much for me to bear. I turned in the work for the research project's final check-in a week after it was due. All students who turned their work in after the due date were supposed to be exempt from the regular presentations, which I expected I'd be included in. However, she told me to do the regular presentations with everyone else. I feel like she's doing this to me because she doesn't like me anymore. But I dunno... What do you think?\n\nAnyway, I digress. What should I do about my presentation? I came up with three viable options:\n\n1. \"F\\*ck this\" version: I pretty much go up there and present a powerpoint that has all blank slides. I sit up there for 10-15 minutes (the required total presentation time) and sit up there in silence, as a form of protest of the situation I described in the above side note. I might play some Spongebob music (the kind that sounds awkward and is all instrumental) to fill the silence.\n2. \"I swear I'm a good student, please don't hate me\" version: I ask a friend to narrate for me (I'll record it, since none of my friends go to the same school as me), the powerpoint actually has a ton of effort put into it, and I get a decent grade for trying.\n3. \"I'm gonna cry\" version: I actually cry, I don't do the presentation, and have an anxiety attack in front of everyone. Teacher either apologizes or calls me a cop-out (which she has called me before).\n\nI feel like regardless of whether I choose 1 or 2, which are my top choices, option 3 will happen. For example, I had to present a mini-research project to my psychology class. However, I emailed my teacher and asked that I don't do it. Instead he offered to present for me. Although I wasn't the one who presented, having my work shown to the class sent me spiraling (I was trembling, numb, and nauseous). I'm afraid that even if I just sit up there and do nothing, I'll get a pretty bad anxiety attack.\n\nIf you guys have any other suggestions or tips, I'd love to hear them!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 733, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Teacher wants me to present, but I'm terrified.

But for the past 7 years, I have lots of difficulty communicating and making friends.

I am just not good at answering questions spontaneously which is probably weird to some people hahaha...\nFor example someone could ask me \"do you like cats or dogs more?\" and I would reply \"I don't really know?\".\n\nBut I go home and think about it (lol) and I can come up with lots of answers like \"I like cats more because they are cute and are less active than dogs and similar to me since I'm not that active either\" and blah blah blah....\n\nAnd then I would think oh my gosh I could've replied that person like this, why did I just say I don't know and end the conversation???\n\nI think the reason why I have this problem of not being able to talk to people \"properly\" or making friends is because I didn't have much experience when I was young (when I had selective mutism)\n\n\nAnd at work my boss would tell me to do things and sometimes I have problem remembering what my boss said, maybe because I have a bad memory, but I think its also because I am scared when they talk (?????) and I can't focus on what they are saying so like the words come in from one ear and go out from the other lol.\n\n\nAnd then some days I would go out to eat lunch with one of my colleagues and I can be silent the whole time unless he/she asks me something. And usually the conversation ends really fast with me just saying \"I don't know\" or \"ok\" or \"yeahhhhhh\".\n\nAnd they probably think I'm very weird, the weirdest person they met in their life (lol) because the i can be silent the whole day? \n\nAlso I want to tell my boss things like I have finished a task given to me or ask about some problems I encounter while doing a task but most of the time, probably 90% of the time (lol) I put off telling my boss about it. I know it is 10283730384720294% better to tell my boss about it but I'm kind of scared of talking??? Like I know I can do it, but I just don't want to, I'm scared, I don't really know what kind of feeling this is lol.

How am I gonna survive in this world like this lol....\n\nI don't really know what to do now, its like I want to improve and be able to communicate better but at the same time I don't want to because its difficult and Im scared which is stupid but yup....\n\nWell...

I want to make sure it's perfect before I send it, though, so I'd appreciate it if you guys read it and gave me your input.\n\nWhat should I add/change/remove? What kind of vibes or messages do you get while reading it (interpretations)? I don't want to look like I want attention or pity, because that isn't my goal at all--far from it, actually.\n\nAnyway, everything after the dot/dash is the message. I replaced names with asterisks for privacy.\n\n\\-\n\nHey guys!! Sorry this is so sudden... I hope I don't bother you too much with this, really you can just ignore this if you want. I just kinda had this thing weighing down on me for a while, like... a long while... and I felt bad for not being honest. I hope you're okay with me saying all of this.\n\nNot gonna lie, it's taking a lot of courage to share this with you guys, so I would appreciate it if you guys could not hate/dislike me after reading this.\n\nSo... where should I start? My problem... I guess I should first give some context? Well, I've been struggling like this since I was almost 5... perhaps before? I can say for sure that I first started exhibiting symptoms when I started school (Kindergarten), anything before that is not within my knowledge or memory.\n\nI guess I could say I've had this problem my whole life? Or at least, for as long as I've been more consciously aware of myself and a time I have the earliest vivid memories of.\n\nIt's something that I can't see myself without since I've had it for so long. I can't remember a time in my life where I wasn't like this.\n\nShould I be more specific now? I'm being so vague like this... I should be more direct...\n\nI've been diagnosed with two conditions, though I'm half-sure about a third diagnosis from a previous therapist. I'll focus on just the two, though, since the third I'm iffy on.\n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder. This first one is easier to talk about in relation to the second, and is much more recognizable, so I guess I'll talk about that one first.\n\nAs the name suggests, I have a lot of anxiety. It takes its toll on my mental and emotional health more often than I'd like, but I guess that's just a part of it. As for physical symptoms, I usually get nauseous. I feel sick. In more extreme scenarios my body trembles violently, my vision blurs, and it becomes hard to breathe. I have to sit down and give myself time and space to calm down. I get anxiety attacks.\n\nI often overthink and beat myself up for little things. Minor inconveniences send me spiraling down. After mental breakdowns and anxiety attacks I'm more prone to any form of negativity, which makes it hard for me to recover. I struggle a lot, and live with feelings of anxiety and fear everyday.\n\nThat's why, during the few times we meet up, I'm so spaced out or exhausted. I get overwhelmed and it shows like that. I'm slowly working on myself so it doesn't happen so much again, so until the time comes that I'm no longer overwhelmed, please don't mind me.\n\nNow, the second one. It's much harder for me to talk about. I've told few people about it, and never went in-depth about it. I never discussed it directly with any of my past therapists, for some reason, either.\n\n...It's a very specific social anxiety/phobia known as selective mutism. It's supposedly a childhood anxiety disorder, and it was for me, but I'm nearly 18 now and still struggle with it everyday.\n\nI'm sure you've probably never heard of it. Most haven't. In a nutshell, it's anxiety-induced mutism. If it doesn't bother you, you can always Google it.\n\nI've probably only ever verbally spoken to one teacher, if my memory is correct. I've spoken to one other person at school in the entire time I've been going. I speak only to a small handful of my relatives/family. Other than those people and you guys, I speak to no one else.\n\nI've never said \"Here!\" when I'm called during attendance. I've never presented my own project without someone's help, if I even give a presentation at all.\n\nLess than a dozen people know about my condition, without counting you guys.\n\nI never or rarely told anyone because I feel immense shame. Jokes, nicknames, reputations, treatment, public humiliation. More often-than-not inflicted by my own family, especially by those who know. I struggle with that often.\n\n\"The quiet girl\" and \"The girl who never talks.\"\n\n\"If you were (in a bad/life-or-death situation), would you talk if it saved you?\"\n\n\"I bet (this thing happened), and that's why you never talk.\"\n\n\"Don't you know? Your dad and I are best friends, so it hurts a lot when you don't talk to me. Speak for me, right now, won't you?\"\n\n\"I won't (do this thing I'm actually obligated to do for you) unless you talk/beg.\"\n\n\"She must not talk because she hates us.\" or \"She doesn't talk to you because she hates you.\"\n\n\"It's my birthday today. Will you please talk to me?\"\n\n\"Hey \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. I do so much for you, just talk this once and I won't tell anyone.\" or \"We're alone right now, no one would hear you if you spoke to me. Could you just say 'hi' this once? I'll keep it a secret!\"\n\n\"I'll cry if you don't talk to me.\"\n\n\"Just talk, \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, haha. What? You can't? Are you mute or something?\" and \"Haha, it's like someone pressed the 'mute' button on you. Are you a TV?\"\n\n\"What will you do about the future? How will you get a job? Don't be so stubborn and start talking. You're not a kid anymore.\"\n\n\"\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* it's been so long since I last saw you!! How long? Like, half a year? I miss your voice! Talk to me!\"\n\n\"Wow, I heard overheard \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* talk at (place) and she sounds like (description)!\"\n\n\"\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* only talks to me because (stupid reason)! She doesn't talk to you because (other stupid reason)!\"\n\n\"Oh I thought you were deaf, haha. I thought you were just really good at lip reading.\"\n\n\"It must be so embarrassing using a whiteboard/notebook to talk to others. Aren't you embarrassed?\" and \"Don't do that. Using a whiteboard? What the fuck? Who even does that?\"\n\n\"Why don't you just fucking talk? Everyone hates you because you don't.\" and \"This is all your fault.\"\n\n\"You're better off just running away.\"\n\n\"Demon\" and \"Bitch.\"\n\n\"\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*'s scary. She looks like she'll murder me in my sleep, haha. She doesn't talk either, so it's scarier!\"\n\n\"Don't you know that your deaf cousin wants to talk but he can't? Yet here you are, completely able to talk, and you still don't? Wow.\"\n\n\"You can't have friends unless you talk.\" or \"Do you even talk to them? How could you call them your friends then?\"\n\n\"Every conversation with \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* is so one-sided. It's hella awkward/I hate it.\"\n\n\"Do you understand English? Yes? Then why aren't you saying anything? Are you stupid?\"\n\n\"If you don't talk to me I will call the police. For all I know you could be hiding something. I can have the police come here and get it out of you, or you can make it easy for yourself and just tell me.\"\n\n\"Why do you need to see a therapist? Talking is easy. Just do it. I don't understand why you can't.\"\n\n\"You're hopeless. You're never going to get better. Go back to your dad. I'm sick of you.\" and \"I'm sick of your shit, \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. Just fucking talk.\"\n\nIf I talk, rumors spread like wildfire. If I talk, more people, family or near-stranger, try to force my voice out of me. If I talk, everyone will bombard me.\n\nWhen I don't talk, rumors still spread like wildfire. When I don't talk, people will even pin me against walls and threaten the voice out of me.\n\nIt's like that for me. The things people, like my mom and older brother, say to me despite knowing about my condition/situation make me feel ashamed. I feel like my condition is stupid, that me struggling with it is stupid. So I don't tell anyone. I'm afraid they'll treat me like my mom does.\n\nThat's why I never really said anything to you guys. I don't mean to be rude by saying this, but I've heard a few similar things from a few of you guys too. That's why I hesitated so much to share this. Even as I'm typing this now I'm scared.\n\nStill, I hope you'll at least have the decency to not say anything hurtful, and be more respectful/mindful of my conditions.\n\nI guess now since I said all those things I should explain why I did. I actually wanted to a long time ago, since near the beginning. I felt like you were all kind and understanding people--I see now that's true for the most part. And it's just that I'm only now opening up. I wanted to say something for once. Since it's you guys, I was able to pluck up some courage despite all that hesitation.

I've known some as long as 6 years, others for about 8 months. They're my closest and most treasured friends, regardless of time I've known them. I trust them more than anyone! We all live far from each other and go to different schools, so it's hard to meet-up in-person.\n\nI've only ever told a few about my anxiety (diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder) and SM. Only one was ever told about SM (though he probably forgot by now, since I told him while he was half-asleep at 3am), and 3-4 others know about my GAD. Other than that, no one has a clue--they all just think of me as quiet and shy.\n\nYesterday, I started to feel bad because we recently had a meet-up where I spent nearly my whole time feeling nauseous (anxiety-induced) and overall physically and mentally overwhelmed. It was one of two meet-ups I was able to go to in the entire time we've known each other, and we have none planned for the future as of right now, so I feel guilty about not making the most of our rare time together.\n\nMany of them texted in response to a paragraph I sent that I didn't need to change because they loved me as I am, but one said \"And \\_\\_\\_ u are already a great friend! Being shy has nothing to do with being a better friend. In fact, I think that characteristic of yours make you more unique and lovable &lt;3\". I wasn't able to respond to that. Personally, anxiety and SM are curses. They ruined my life, and continue to do so. I can't think of them as \"unique and lovable\" characteristics.\n\nThat text has been stuck in my head since I first read it. It made me realize how much they don't know about me, despite all the time I've known them and the amount of personal life stuff we share. I want to tell them so there won't be any more misunderstandings (and less jokes about me being the quiet one), but I'm scared. I know they'll be supportive, but because of the way people in my family treat me, I feel ashamed of my anxiety. That shame is making it hard for me...\n\nHow should I overcome this?

I\u2019m trying to figure out if I had it as a child and still do now. I understand that it is widely misunderstood and i want to understand. \n\nI was VERY quiet as a child. So much so that teachers had to intervene and Once a day I had to tell them something I liked about school? Lol. But I would speak to friends and family so no one ever really saw it as a problem- I had trouble with \u2018authority figures\u2019 though, like teachers. I would speak when spoken to, but never answer anything in class or initiate conversations. \n\nI grew out of this, but I was still very shy. I have always been known as the shy one. So much so that when I would speak people would do that thing where they act all surprised. \n\nI only came across selective mutism recently because I was googling stuff like \u201cfeeling like I can\u2019t speak in social situations\u201d. It is just a feeling and I can literally? I\u2019m not sure if that makes a difference. Sometimes I feel so anxious and stuck in social situations like college classes etc. I won\u2019t know what to say (I overthink and overanalyse to the point where anything I say would just sound unnatural, I can get very insecure and unsure of myself). I don\u2019t initiate conversations very often at all and I feel rude if I was to interject into one. I have quite severe social anxiety. I understand that selective mutism is a severe form of anxiety? But what I\u2019m trying to understand is it the complete inability to speak rather than just feelings of anxiety and awkwardness. I speak when spoken to and if someone asks me a question, but sometimes I do desperately want to talk but my mind either goes totally blank due to overthinking, or I\u2019m just too anxious and embarrassed- so I just stay quiet. Is this selective mutism? Feeling completely inhibited when it comes to speaking? Or is selective mutism less \u2018situational\u2019 and more like you won\u2019t even speak when someone asks a question?

For whatever reason, I never got around to it. My intention was to inspire and encourage others struggling with SM. I guess it was important to lurk for a bit to get a feel for what others are going through. I wanted my words to be the right words...to not call attention to myself or to alienate others in any way. This is my success story...not to flaunt my successes, but to let someone know that success is possible.\n\nI don't really remember how it started. I remember that as a kid, my mom stayed home and babysat a bunch of kids. I had no issues communicating then. I had plenty of friends, and I spoke to them all. I spoke to my family. I spoke to people at church. Then, somewhere along the way, I stopped. It was some time around starting preschool. I spoke to my parents, to my grandparents, a couple of cousins, aunts, and uncles, and a whole two friends at preschool. That's it. I don't remember it starting. There was no specific trigger (at least, not to my four-year-old mind), I just didn't want to talk. \n\nMy parents were concerned, obviously. At first everyone thought I was shy. But as the months went on, I still didn't speak. My \"list\" of people I would speak to capped itself out at around ten people. Eventually, I even stopped talking to those two friends from preschool (we ended up going to school together all the way through high school). \n\nMy parents took me to a psychiatrist. Eventually they diagnosed me with SM and put me on medication. I remember being asked on multiple occasions if anyone had ever \"touched\" me or told me they would hurt me or my family if I spoke. I knew that wasn't the case, but it felt like nobody believed me. It didn't make sense that I would just randomly stop talking. \n\nEventually I accepted my SM as part of my identity. As I got older, I recognized how thinking about speaking to people gave me crippling anxiety, so it was easier to just roll with it. I figured out other ways of communicating. My teachers wanted to hold me back at one point, but fortunately my parents refused and I was able to stay with my same class. I did very well in school. The teachers were mostly understanding and figured out ways for me to participate without speaking. I always had straight A's. I had tons of friends - I fit in with most of your stereotypical \"cliques.\" My closest friends even came up with our own form of sign language and would translate for me so I didn't have to write notes all the time. Looking back, I definitely took my friends for granted. \n\nBy the time I got to 3rd grade, my parents and teachers were working together to figure out how to handle oral presentations. They decided I should videotape myself giving my presentations at home and play them at school. I was traumatized. Eventually, I gave in, but I left the classroom when the first few tapes were played. When I came back in, heart pounding, everyone was actually really nice about it. Most people just carried on as usual, not making a huge deal like I feared. Those who did say something made comments like \"I really like your voice!\" or \"You did great!\" and other mostly encouraging words. Again, totally took my classmates for granted then.\n\nThis pattern carried on until 8th grade. I graduated middle school second in my class. I was supposed to give a speech at graduation, but they didn't make me. \n\nI was terrified of high school. New people, new teachers, new environment, new everything. All of my friends were there, of course, but everyone kind of went their separate ways. I started out freshman year just like every other year: refusing to speak but desperate not to attract too much attention for it. Just as I expected, it was much more difficult. People who hadn't known me for years were much more critical and cruel. Making new friends was difficult. Teachers were much less willing to cater to me. I was struggling. \n\nMy parents were afraid that my SM would hold me back, and I would regret not pushing myself to break through as I got older. They started to get more pushy with challenging me to speak to people. They would orchestrate encounters to coax me to speak. We all knew deep down, though, that it had to be my decision. \n\nIt wasn't an easy one.\n\nAround my birthday January of freshman year, I had a friend over. I usually had several over, but this time it was just one - one of my closest friends. My parents wanted me to speak to him, and for the first time I truly wanted to as well. They had given his mom a heads-up beforehand, and had spoken with him earlier that evening as well. We went to my bedroom and sat for a minute, and I was very obviously anxious. He looked at me and said \"It's alright, man. You're okay.\" Apparently that moment of understanding and kindness was just enough to crack the surface, because immediately I was able to blurt out (in a tearful whisper) \"I know.\" \n\nSuper anticlimactic for my first words, but that was my breakthrough. I was shocked. After those two short words, I found myself having full conversations with him the rest of the night. It felt so liberating - such intense euphoria. But I still wasn't \"cured.\" I could only speak to that one friend. \n\nOver the course of the next semester, I started choosing one-by-one new friends to speak to for the first time. In hindsight, this progression happened pretty quickly. I added 5 or 6 friends to that list over a few months. Then, my parents challenged me to take a bigger step - speak to a whole group of people. \n\nWe had an overnight event with the youth group at church (they were like my extended family). I chose this group and this event as my next leap. Again, this was all orchestrated by my parents, so everyone was prepared. We all got into a big circle, and after the youth pastor explained what was going on, I spoke the first words (word) in front of a big group...\"Hey.\" \n\nJust like before, I was able to slowly move towards full conversations with everyone by the end of the night. I was initially incredibly anxious, but after that first intentional word, the weight was lifted off. I moved forward by adding groups at a time now, starting with a couple of classes at school. The more people I spoke to, the easier it got.\n\nFast forward to sophomore year, I gave myself my own challenge - proceed as if SM was never a thing. It was frightening, but after the first few classes and answering \"Here\" during attendance, I was able to nonchalantly dodge the shocked responses from my peers and move forward with the new school year. \n\nIt took a bit, but I eventually applied this to the rest of my interactions - ordering for myself at restaurants, carrying on full-volume conversations in public, etc. \n\nThen, my best friend was killed in a car accident. I was crushed. I was asked to speak at his funeral at our church. I didn't even hesitate. A few days later, I found myself giving my first public speech in front of several hundred people. People without SM even struggle with public speaking, so you can imagine the anxiety involved here.\n\nContinuing through school, I began to thrive. I got involved with FBLA and eventually became president of our chapter. I competed in Business Plan, presenting with my team in front of panels of judges until we placed 5th nationally my senior year. I graduated as salutatorian and gave my speech in front of an enormous crowd at graduation.\n\nI went on to college, pushed through my residual social anxiety and joined a fraternity. After easing my way in, I worked my way onto the executive board and eventually became chapter president. I graduated college with honors and moved on to my career as an accountant.\n\nThree years later, I'm 25, married, preparing to close on our brand new house, excelling in my career as a Senior Financial Analyst, actively involved in our church, and even slowly building a small accounting practice of my own. \n\nAgain, I'm not listing off my successes to brag. I just want others to know that a boy who struggled with SM for 14 years once made a conscious decision to speak. It was the hardest choice I ever made, and leading up to that first moment I felt like dying would be lest painful and less frightening. It took a supportive family and friend group, a single understanding friend, and a ton of willpower to make it through. But you can make it through. It starts with your choice to no longer be confined by your SM. It won't be easy, but as someone who's been where you are, believe me. It's so worth it. You've got this.\n\nThe SM is still there. I still find it crippling to start conversations at large gatherings. I sometimes can't make myself speak up in large meetings. My anxiety has returned, and on bad days I find it difficult to muster up the willpower to even speak a sentence to my amazing wife. I still struggle, and I'm still growing. But I no longer consider my SM my identity. It's just a nagging obstacle that I'm proud to have overcome.

I had such bad social anxiety, that I literally did not talk to anyone outside my immediate family. I remember once, staying the night at a friends place. I \"accidentally\" said a word, and freaked the hell out. \n\nI did not communicate. By the time high school came around, I literally had no friends. They all left me, some even treating me like garbage in the process. Everyone treated me like some freak, like someone who was mentally disabled (not that you should treat them different than any normal person), or just ignored me. \n\nI wanted to die. The lonliness made me ask a God I didnt even believe in at the time, to end it. To end me. I was that lonely and depressed. But I knew a single person who had once treated me like a normal person. Literally the only person in the world who treated me like a normal person. I later on reached out to her. She saved my life. I talked to her eventually. This eventually lead to me joining a church group for young adults. There, for the first time in my life, I talked to a group of people. It felt like a weight had been lifted. My entire life changed from that day. \n\nIn the end, it has made me a better person in a way. I have worked customer service, ironically enough, for a good 8 years now. While it has made me a little jaded, my youth years made me understand what it is like to be treated with hate, disdain, and everything like that. It made me want to never treat someone the way I had been treated. I have made some amazing friends, and have made an amazing impact on someone else's life. I still deal with depression and lonliness sometimes, but my life has improved beyond that which words can explain. I never truly understood my issues, other than acknowledging it as severe social anxiety. But for those of you who deal with the same \"SM\" th hat I dealt with, I just want to tell you this:\n\nTalk.\n\nIt is hard. It may seem impossible. It doesnt make any sense why it is hard and impossible. But you will live. You will be alive. Humans cannot exist without social interactions. You will experience happiness and love. You will make the greatest decision you've ever made in your life. You will overcome the impossible. You will change lives, and bring happiness to those who drown in sorrow like you yourself do. \n\nYou will be free.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 643, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My drunken thoughts", "updated_utc": 1556283756, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/bh5nv1/my_drunken_thoughts/"}, {"author": "usodayo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_16kxe1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1556160215, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/bh3ic8/question_how_do_i_make_my_so_who_is_sm_feel_safe/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "bh3ic8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/bh3ic8/question_how_do_i_make_my_so_who_is_sm_feel_safe/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1556160216, "score": 6, "selftext": "Hello r/selectivemutism!

My college friend (18M) lives 45 minutes away from me, and we met online. I'll call him N. N's younger cousin is a high school junior. I don't know N's cousin's age or name--only that we go to the same school. I will call N's cousin as C.\n\nI never talk at school. No one at school has heard my voice, except for a few rare times over the years when my voice slipped out or someone posted a video of me online. Only a few teachers know about my condition. I did a research project in my Psychology class on SM, but never directly told my classmates I had it, though I think many of them who know about it speculate.\n\nMany people don't try to talk to me. I always assumed it was because I often act like I don't care about anyone (I put on a facade of someone aloof so I don't have to go through the social embarrassment of using written communication). However, N told me earlier that C texted N. C said he felt bad always seeing me alone (keep in mind that although I was previously told what C's name was, and have met him once before when he was sitting in the backseat of my brother's car, I don't remember what he looks like or anything else about him), especially during passing period (which is the period of time we have to get to the next class) and lunch.\n\nN continued on to say that C and many others at school think I'm mute. N and C don't know I have SM, so I'm pretty sure he meant in the physical sense, and had no idea that he hit it right on the nail. I just laughed and gave a few excuses (I said I didn't \"f\\*ck with anyone at that school--they're all drama-thirsty. I just want some peace and quiet.\"), but didn't know whether I should address the real problem (that I actually have SM and act like a jerk so that I feel less bad about the fact that I'm a social outcast at school).\n\nI know it's in the name, but can I consider SM as a legitimate form of mutism? It's a pretty stupid question, but the majority of people in my life constantly crack inconsiderate jokes about me not talking (even my friends and family, especially the ones who know about my condition). Because of that, I don't feel like I have a real reason to not talk.\n\nBut what do you think? Should I have said something like, \"Well, that's because I kind of AM mute\"???", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id":

her own her children. \n\nmy brother is 12, for as long as i can remember he\u2019s always been \u201cshy\u201d but i guess i always chalked that up to his age rather than an anxiety thing. we all figured he\u2019d just grow out of it but i think now that he\u2019s at that age where he should have grown out of it it\u2019s viewed more as..inappropriate and out of character for someone his age. \n\nhis teachers constantly mention how quiet he is. we realised he definetly doesn\u2019t talk to anyone he considers a authority figure. so basically anyone he doesn\u2019t know on a first name based.\n\nwhen i brought it up to my mom in a serious conversation, figuring she may know more than i do about where to start, she told me she would look into it (i think she meant research as she didn\u2019t know anything about it and i only heard about this anxiety disorder (is that right?)  last year). she asked me what we could do and i told her i was told by a different and long deleted reddit post therapy helps a great deal. \n\nso how can i help him? most importantly how can we find out if he actually is selectively mute or just something else relating to anxiety? should we speak to his teachers or counselors? our doctor? should i ask my own therapist for advice on this? i\u2019m feeling a little reluctant with that idea as i\u2019ve been questioning whether or not i have a neurological disorder with him and don\u2019t want to come off as someone who goes around diagnosing people.\n\nreally i\u2019m just concerned. i went through my own stuff when i started middle school and didn\u2019t begin to recover from it until late into freshman year. i know it\u2019s easy to fall into a depression if you feel out of touch with your peers and it\u2019s even harder to recover after you\u2019ve made the physical transition into young adulthood when you haven\u2019t mentally. i\u2019m attempting to stop something before it starts. so no, i\u2019m not going around diagnosing people with whatever i happen to read on wikipedia that day. \n\nif anyone has been diagnosed with selective mutism at a young to middle school age how did you first get diagnosed? if you see a therapist but struggled with communicating with them at first what are some tips you can give my brother if he decides to see a therapist? please and thank you ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler":

If you don't wanna read, you can skip down and just comment your story.\n\nWhen I started preschool I remember my teacher asking me if I wanted something. I nodded my head but it was clearly not enough. \"Use your words\" she said, and I remember my heart racing and the fear and panic I felt. I froze and didn't say anything, so she gave up and just handed it to me. I didn't talk to a single person, not even my friends. At home though, I spoke absolutely fine, yet the moment we left the door I clung onto my mom, never letting go of her hand, and sealed my mouth shut the entire time. Also, not going into too much details, but in the middle of preschool my parents divorced. Before this, I lived for almost a year alone with my mom and, well, let's just say I experienced tons of anxiety due to some things she did. Not sure if this further contributed to how I am now, ya know, with all those 'underlying causes from early childhood that mess up kids later'. Anyways, near the end of preschool I was talking to some friends. I also recall babbling away to one teacher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to let's say, grade 4. I was more confident than ever. I raised my hand, could easily have a conversation with the teacher and all of my classmates. I even desperately raised my hand to get a role in a school play we were doing. I remember volunteering to read something on stage through a microphone to the entire school. When I got up, I was kind of nervous, and remember thinking, \"Oh, is this that feeling of having butterflies in your stomach?\". But I got over it, and bravely read my paper out to the school. Again, I was titled as \"shy\" and \"quiet\" but I could still talk fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, grade 6 came, the worst year of my life. You know those usual, you-make-friends-with-someone-but-they-turn-out-to-be-really-mean stories? Yup, this was that. Me and my best friend made friends with this girl. She was absolutely nice at first, then changed entirely. First, she started out by making fun of us, and constantly judging us. Calling us ugly and weird and judging every aspect of our clothes and face and the way we walked etc. Then things got absolutely worse, she told random guys I liked them and spread rumours throughout our entire grade. I was embarrased to even walk, having people constantly talk behind my back and to my face. On top of that, I was extremely self-conscious due to her constant judging. She judged EVERYTHING, right down to the way I walked. At this time, I was often mad at that girl inside my heart and would often cry at school (no teacher bothered to ask me what's wrong) but that's all, and in no way was I ever depressed. Also, for the first time in my life I started shaking during a presentation, and it had scared me so badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, in grade 7 I moved schools. I was finally away from the girl and could breathe. I didn't talk much to my classmates (and never the guys), I never raised my hand in class, but I still could talk. I also met my 2 friends, who were very confident and loud and it caught onto me. Man, did we have fun. The 3 of us were so hyper, but I still made sure to calm myself down in front of a teacher and the guys. I wasn't silent; when a teacher asked me anything I openly responded in full sentences. In grade 8 though, those friends were in a different class. I slowly lost my confidence. I felt extremely self-conscious, and the words of the bullying from grade 6 were getting to my head. My social anxiety increased and I started getting depressed. Grade 6 circulated my mind, and even my parents divorce was getting to my head as well and I cried for the FIRST time over it, wondering why I was so worthless that even my own mom didnt love me and left me. My anxiety increased and I started falling back into my old silence. I never spoke a word to any one, no classmate and no teacher, except for my friends. Social anxiety and depression were severely consuming me, as well as my SM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn grade 9, I had the same teacher from grade 7. After about 1 month in, she could clearly tell something was wrong, as I had turned silent and got concerned. One day, I got called to the counselors office and she said my teacher was worried and stuff, and I should get counselling to gain my confidence. During parent-teacher meeting my teacher said I was quiet before, but not this quiet, and can tell somethings wrong etc. Well, my parents refused conselling cause they dont trust counsellors. Dunno how this worked, but they got out of it somehow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I'm in high school (here its grades 10-12). In the first year, I had a presentation and the class was much bigger than usual. I was so nervous, that when I presented my hands visibly shook, my voice sounded like I was gonna cry, and the words were a mumble (first time this happened). My group after asked me if i was okay. This repeatedly happened presentation after presentation, to the point that my hands fell asleep (it occurs due to hyperventilation, because not enough oxygen goes to your body including hands) and well, hyperventilating. Its humiliating to have the class see you like this. Also, often when a teacher called on me to talk there would be laughter. On top of this, I was constantly being lectured by teachers for not talking, one saying that \"people will judge me if I'm like this\". At this point, SM has completely taken over and I am now absolutely silent in school, except and only to my friends when we're alone and I'm also slowly starting to talk less at home as well. I definitely think SM needs more awareness.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 580, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What's your selective mutism story?", "updated_utc": 1554509559, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/b8qzo1/whats_your_selective_mutism_story/"}, {"author": "maxipadsforeveryone", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2jarxy71", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1554233951, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/b8nuvl/should_i_return_to_regular_school_next_year/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "b8nuvl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/b8nuvl/should_i_return_to_regular_school_next_year/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1554233952, "score": 4, "selftext": "Hey I suck at making life decisions so i\u2019m asking here if you read all of this I really appreciate you:\n\nI am a highschool freshman.

I probably go to the biggest highschool in my state so that doesn\u2019t help my anxiety being around thousands of kids I can\u2019t talk to. But even though I constantly felt uncomfortable and hated it I dealt with it.\n\nWelp second semester that changed. I was just done with everything and basically gave up and couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. I was feeling more sad and less motivated. My therapist put me on some anxiety meds but they gave me frequent panic attacks for the first time in my life. For example I was at a concert with my dad and had to leave early because I was having a panic attack and crying right in the middle of it (i\u2019m not on that medication anymore.)\n\nThis medication led to me missing 2 weeks of school. I never wanted to go back. The school therapist told me there was this program where I would go to this class for 2 hours every week day and do this online school on the computer. I was forced into that so here I am now.\n\nI have the option to go to school next year or do that program and I have no clue what to do.

I hope you'll take the time to read this, and that you'll be understanding of my situation.\n\n-\n\nI was four years old. Frankly, I was actually 22 days too young to be in Kindergarten, but they allowed me to enroll anyways due to the already small-class sizes. The first day of school was horrifying. I sat on a large blue (?) rug, bawling my eyes out along with a dozen other kids surrounding me. Within 10 minutes or so, most have calmed down. Not me, though. I was terrified, my dad was nowhere in sight, and I had no idea what was going on. I didn't talk. I never spoke.\n\nThat's the reputation I had: \"The girl who doesn't talk.\"\n\nIt persisted for a few years, both in- and out-of- school. Close family members and distant relatives all wondered why I never uttered a word to them. Still, I was an outgoing child. At school, I was popular amongst my peers and had many friends.\n\nStill, the nonverbal thing was getting out of hand. I think I was in the third grade when I first saw a therapist; I don't remember much about her, aside from the fact that she was nice and always played with me. She mentioned that her mom and I had the same name (I don't know why I remembered that). She had some contract, though, and it ended. I had to get a new therapist. The new one was awkward, and I was much less comfortable around her. No progress.\n\nI soon moved across the country with my dad and his new wife (my biological parents got divorced when I was around 2-3 years old). I lived there for 2 years, during my 5th grade and 6th grade years. I moved back home to my biological mom the day after 6th grade ended.\n\nI didn't get treatment. I stayed mute. The last two of my middle school years were plagued by anxiety and depression.\n\nHigh school is... okay. The first semester of freshman year sucked, but the second semester was great. I broke out of my shell, and was finally able to muster the confidence to wave to my friends and smile! Before that, I developed a habit of always covering the bottom half of my face with my hand. I always wore long-sleeves, even when it got unbearably hot.\n\nSophomore year sucked. I decided to be partially-homeschooled, so I only had to go to school twice a week for one-hour each (once to see a teacher who'll check up on my progress, and once for a Chemistry lab class). I did the rest of my work at-home.\n\nI stayed home a lot more and the depression returned. I wanted to go back to public school to see my friends again. I didn't go back until junior year. At the same time, though, I was extremely self-confident in my appearance (as a sophomore). I constantly donned shorts and t-shirts, experimented with my style, and wouldn't hesitate to smile during the hot spring, summer, and fall months (yes, global warming got our seasons all messed up).\n\nStill, mute. The summer after my sophomore year is very memorable. I discovered that I could speak to strangers, as long as my closest family members (by blood/birth, not by friendship/familial-personal-relationship) weren't in the vicinity; this is mostly attributed to the fact that strangers don't have the expectation of mutism from me as strangers, and that my family members don't intimidate me.\n\nI'm a senior year now. An extremely social family friend of mine invited me to an event for one of her school clubs. It was held at an amusement park during public hours, so there was quite the crowd. I was introduced to countless people (who I wouldn't be able to recognize today, due to the briefness of our meeting and the day's hecticity). I was often stopped by complete strangers who wanted to know what event was going on. I was able to explain without stuttering or feeling anxiety!\n\nI can't talk at school (unless it's to this one guy who I met in freshman year, and who today is still one of my most cherished friends), nor can I to MOST of my family, but I could at least talk to people I've never met before! This gave me hope. I planned for college and I know what I'll be when I grow up.\n\nToday, as I'm mere weeks away from graduation, I hope to soon get my first job. I have confidence in myself that I can do it as long as I don't meet anyone I know.\n\nAs of right now, I have no hope for talking to people who know me as the \"quiet girl\", but that's okay. I'll get to that someday, when I'm ready.\n\nI'm sure that someday you, too, will be able to make these strides like me. Baby steps, everyone, baby steps. Take the time you need to improve! After all, this is something you've probably had for as long as I have, perhaps even longer! It's not gonna be easy, and even making the decision to get better requires immense courage, but I believe you can do it. I believe in you!!\n\nAnd I'm proud. I'm proud of you for fighting all this time. Sometimes even living, or breathing, gets hard. That's okay. Take your time. I'm proud of you. I applaud you for all this time you've endured, fighting little and big fights alone. I'm proud.\n\n-\n\nAhh... Now here's a little change in tone!! I'd like to ask you all, preferably from those who are older and have experience, how you may have improved your condition. What did you do and how? Tell me a little about yourself, your life!! I want to get to know you and your achievements, failures too. Perhaps if we can share our stories, we can slowly overcome this together!\n\nWhat do ya say?

Apparently I was normal before, but then I suddenly stopped talking to my dad. I don't remember if there was anything that brought this on. My parents were never abusive, though my dad is a boisterous drunk.\n\n\nAs I was learning to talk, I would mispronounce stuff (like many kids do). One psychologist thought maybe I stopped talking because my dad would joke around a bit about words I said wrong. Not sure about that. I saw a speech therapist in early grade school for a while. I hated it, and I remember thinking she was mean.\n\n\nThat's the whole extent of the treatment I got for SM. I think I saw the psychologist when I was 4/5/6. There wasn't much progress made.\n\n\nIn kindergarten, they made me record myself using a weird big button thing. We would go around doing greetings, and I would have to press it and play my voice recorded. I hated it and resisted doing it all I could. \n\n\nBy some miracle, I managed to make two very close friends in grade school. I would initially only whisper to them, but eventually I spoke loudly. I think young kids were less judgmental and more just curious toward me. This changed in middle school when we all got older.\n\n\nIn my district, we had four elementary schools that all funneled into one middle and high school. So that meant there would be a shitload more people, and also that I wouldn't have many classes with my friends - my biggest support.\n\n\nThis is where the depression began. Middle school kids were harsh. I'm good at reading peoples faces and voices. I could almost palpably feel the judgement and sometimes outright disgust toward me. Sometimes I could get words out but they were quiet and nervous and awkward. I felt terrible either way and dwelt on it afterward. I got shitty grades but excelled at standardized tests.\n\n\nI also cycled through some weird...tics? for a bit. I would sniffle or make a small sound and later had trichotillomania aka pulling my hair out until I had a small but noticeable bald spot.\n\n\nOne of my friends made other friends. She realized how weird I was and that hanging around me would only bring her down. We parted ways. \n\n\nI read a lot of books and spent a lot of time online during middle school to pass the time. Initially I felt anxiety even talking to people online, but I got over that with practice. \n\n\nIn high school, I spent my days waiting for them to be over. I had a calendar, and I crossed off each day that passed, though I didn't have anything to look forward to once the days or years were over. My one remaining friend was there for me if I wanted, but I stopped contacting her. I didn't have a conscious reason at the time, but maybe it was because I didn't bring anything to the friendship. I was empty.\n\n\nI didn't get a driver's license or a job or a relationship. I was falling behind. I wasn't living. I realized I was missing experiences, wasting my precious teen years, but I didn't know what to do to fix things.\n\n\nI took a gap year only because I didn't know what to do with myself. I didn't do *anything* for over a year. My family didn't seem to notice how dead inside I was. I could still put on a happy exterior. On the other hand, with not having to interact with anyone, I didn't have any anxiety. My resting heart rate went way down.\n\n\nI didn't realize how bad it was. I tried not to think too much about my situation. I prevented myself from thinking by basically constantly consuming media, because it was easier.\n\n\nAll through my life my brother has been the person I'm closest to - the only person with whom I can have a totally normal flowing conversation every time. Don't know where I'd be without him. I still don't talk to my dad, but we have a good relationship somehow. I feel guilty about that.\n\n\nI went to a two year college without a plan or any sense of direction, but with hope that things would get better and with resolve to try.  We had to give lots of short presentations and group discussions, and I did them all. Sometimes things went very well and I was able to convince people I was normal. Sometimes there was zero anxiety, other times my heart was racing. Only a few times when a teacher unexpectedly called on me in front of everyone did words get lodged in my throat. It seems I'm worse with males.\n\n\nI hate when people figure it out. I like when I can hide and internalize it all.\n\n\nThe depression became harder to keep inside. I got super unstable emotionally. My net happiness was higher than in years, but there were more peaks and valleys. I started reading and enjoying it again, something I hadn't done much of in five years. I did very well academically, though I struggled with motivation, procrastination, and focus. My brain feels very slow sometimes.\n\n\nI'm not sure what I need. I've never liked the idea of medication. I don't like the side effects or messing with brain chemistry. I still don't like to talk to most people, so I'm not sure about opening up with a stranger about my problems. Things have definitely gotten better, but I don't know...", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 563, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "my life story", "updated_utc": 1554351962, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/b6cidx/my_life_story/"}, {"author": "theothersophie", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "b6b7719c-3617-11e9-b03e-0e5056f81462", "author_flair_text": "Not SM -

And how that feels? And how to deal with being around those people if you have any advice?  \n\n\nIn my experience, it's usually consistently the same people and often people I really love or really want to be around but I can't say anything and when I try super hard to speak word jumble comes out.  Sometimes, it feels like I forget all my words and the only way I can pretend to speak is by repeating the same words they have said in different configurations but this makes me feel like I'm stupid. And even this way of piecing sentences together is the best case scenario usually I just can't say anything and it's not like there's something I wish I could say-- it's really like my brain is so confused or overwhelmed that it can't compose a sentence.

old and i\u2019m beginning to think he\u2019s selectively mute.\n\nto make it clear: i have mentioned this to my parents before but they brushed it off as him being socially awkward and needing time to adjust or whatever. but if he is selectively mute i want to know what i can do to support him as a sibling and friend. now, i\u2019m not looking to \u201cfix\u201d him as i don\u2019t think that\u2019s my place in the slightest and it has yet to impact him in a way that\u2019s had negative feedback.  \n\ni began questioning him when he asked me to go to school conference with him and our mom. i said yes, not sure why but i did, i went. he\u2019s a good student, smart, i\u2019m very proud of him and i try to express that the best i can as our parents are the \u201cthat\u2019s great but with some more studying you could be even better\u201d type, they\u2019re proud but they\u2019re perfectionist and being the first born i know sometimes you just want to hear \u201cgood job\u201d every now and again. \n\nanyways, when we got there we shook hands with his homeroom teacher and took a seat while she showed us a file of his work. she mentioned how he improved his math scores a lot and even seemed to be enjoying himself, she turned and asked him \u201cAre you liking math?\u201d \n\nhe didn\u2019t respond in the slightest, not to her anyways. he look back at us like he was an actor who forgot his line. he plays video games a lot with his headset on so i figured he just had a moment where he didn\u2019t hear zip. i repeated the question and while only looking at me he said \u201cyea, i guess\u201d\n\nevery time she asked him a question as simple as what type of books or video games he liked he would look at me and not her. when he did respond to her it was just a quick nod or a shrug. i thought he was just overwhelmed and anxious so i answered most of the questions about his personal life without looking pushy.\n\ni thought it was odd, i had never seen him like that. at home he\u2019s very loud, sarcastic and even a little blunt in a comedic sense. he makes short films with his friends where he plays an on screen character, he talks outside the house too but i guess i never really noticed that he really only talks to me and our parents. \n\nnow that i\u2019ve been thinking about it i think back to times when i figured he was just being awkward. like at church when someone asks him how his week was and he\u2019ll just stare and shrug while making little to no eye contact, or sometime when my parents are talking to him in the car he\u2019ll just look at me as a way of letting me know he doesn\u2019t want to talk and wants to do it for him- usually he\u2019s in a mood but he\u2019ll still talk a little to me, or when he\u2019s playing his video games and has the head set with mic on. he mumbles a lot, can barely understand him but he\u2019s not usually that mumbly with us. sometimes he\u2019ll ask me to hang out with him while he plays, he likes the audience, and then he\u2019ll ask me to talk through the mic for him and i\u2019ll do it because i\u2019m bored. i think he\u2019d ask me more if it weren\u2019t for the fact that i don\u2019t understand a thing about video games and often forget to repeat whatever\u2019s being said back to him.  \n\nand i have asked him if he thought maybe he was purposely not responding the folks because he was anxious or uncomfortable or felt like he physically couldn\u2019t and just claimed that he was shy but i have my doubts. \n\nhe and i are very close and frankly he\u2019s my best friend. i have my own anxiety driven mental illnesses and even have a stutter so i don\u2019t like to push him into anything that might bother him as i have a good idea of what that might be like.\n\nif he isn\u2019t selectively mute that\u2019s just as good, or just means he\u2019s an awkward guy and i can work with him if he wants to from one awkward guy to another but if he i want to know what i can do as someone who doesn\u2019t fully understand why he does the things he does.

I dropped out of high school after a few weeks since I didn't feel I could handle with being there at all of reasons I myself can't explain clearly and I don't like being surrounded by lots of people however after having tons of meeting with school staff and other people (sometimes I didn't even show of up because I couldn't and didn't want to so my mom went alone and just told me what they talked about after but the times I did go there, I was told I only needed to either nod by doing the gestures of yes, no, \"don't know\", sometimes I verbally say out the words, yes, no, maybe, don't know. but that's it since it's impossible for me to say \"long\" sentences unless I speak alone at home with family like, mom, brother, but I stutter more than normally and can't even express my thoughts clearly and I usually can't remember what I want to say and sometimes I can't even say the word I meant since I can't remember it even if I know what the word is.\n\nAfter a few weeks of discussions they sent me to a small \"school\" which had around 8-12 people +including staff. It's okay being there but they only have a few substances so it's not really a \"real\" high school and I only need to speak a few times but it causes me feeling \"nervous, scared, panic etc..\" and I have a huge relief in my mind, stomach, body after my speech have ended and don't need to speak again for the rest of the day (Not sure if it's a bad thing) and the words I use to talk may sound improperly in grammar wise and since I have speech impediment I choose my words carefully but it's hard and just sounds wrong either way and i'm clueless what will happen later since I can't stay here forever and finish my high school degree so they will most likely send me to a \"real\" high school later but how? I would do the same thing as before, drop out again but this time I won't even go there since they have no solutions for my problems (the only thing that I can think of if they have a special kind of teacher that is specialized in people with speech disorders and such and will assist me through high school and be there for me til I graduate, however I have no idea if it's possible even if it stated in the law here that the school need to do whatever they can to help me to graduate and I don't even like being with other people after grown accustomed to loneliness for years.\n\nEven in middle school the only way I graduated there to pass qualifications for high school was that I went there 1-2 hours everyday being alone in a room and study and did tests (I never talked with the teachers). I quit being in the classroom when the 8th grade started and never went to school until 9th grade to pass the substances I needed so I haven't talked to my 2 friends for nearly 2-3 years now but I have them on snapchat.\n\nI can't speak with strangers, teachers, students, family relatives like cousins and such. I often do gestures even at my speech therapist or use my daily words like, yes, no, maybe, don't know, but I often say yes even if I want to say no and sometimes I use maybe/don't know instead for saying yes/no\n\nI feel unmotived to do anything in life and I have no joy in almost anything I do. The only thing I feel now is to be left alone in my room forever but that's impossible.\n\nI avoid anything that expects me to talk. I avoid making eye contact with every person even if it's my family. The only times I can genuinely smile and laugh is when i'm alone. My facial expression stays the same almost 24/7 even if I do think something is funny I don't laugh, sometimes I get an uncontrollable smile but it only last for 1-2 secs until it go back to normal.\n\nMy voice have different tones sometimes and at unexpected/surprised times when there's a situation where I need to talk i'm terror-strucked instantly and have hundreds of thoughts simultaneously on how to avoid to talk or how to say the shortest sentence possible like if a stranger suddenly confront me and ask me something.\n\nAt home I happen to be more be angry, irritable, frustrated and I need to be informed at anything that can involve me in some way.\n\nI had Trichotillomania for a long period of time (hair pulling) but I got over it since I didn't want to have a bold spot at my head since it can attract people attentions and I actually liked the feeling when you pull out the hair sometimes I took a handful and just pull them out the hardest I could do and the white thing at the root of the hair I ate them aswell.\n\nI haven't seen my speech therapist for a few months now but they said that I would be talking to her again in like a few weeks but I only feel like it's hopeless but at the same time I feel, I don't know maybe appreciated?\n\nI feel like even if I get intense treatment it won't help me, medications? what kind of medications? does it even have a affect on me? I don't know.\n\nMy only interests are calligraphy (I want to learn it but it's takes long practice and work, besides i'm a left writer so it takes more work) I have an interest in learning chinese but that takes patience and hard practice for 2.5-5 learns to master it to some degree. I like poker but that takes practice aswell, intense studying to be good at it and ofcourse money. You could practically say i'm talentless at everything.\n\nThat's it, i'm sure I can write alot more but this text took me 3.5 hours to get it *done.* ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 428, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "SM - Current life.", "updated_utc": 1553963062, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/awhzmj/sm_current_life/"}, {"author": "dinkpiper", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2iw0mdoh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1551510099, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/awf2r7/i_go_mute_with_my_boyfriend_and_it_caused_us_to/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "awf2r7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/awf2r7/i_go_mute_with_my_boyfriend_and_it_caused_us_to/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1551510100, "score": 3, "selftext": "Mainly just a rant\n\nAs the title says, I go mute with him.

You can talk about the nausea, the pain, the secondary effects but you can't heal it. You really do need an expert. You don't know the 10 year prognosis, the effective ways of treating it, how bad it actually is.\n\nIf untreated, selective mutism can take hold of you and you can be 30 or older and still struggling with it. I myself am a very socially anxious adult in part because it was never treated. However, I still figured out what the problem was, found the label. I found other people who had the disorder, I found different techniques to handle my anxiety on my own. Not ideal, but it helped. \n\nIf SM is like cancer then the ways to treat it are operations. It's really delicate and there's a lot that can go wrong if you just ignore the problem or use the wrong methods to make it better. \n\nI want to highlight how there's nothing any bystander can do can heal the 'cancer'. Nothing you can say or do will make it go away. It's up to the sufferer, his body and the process of educating himself on his illness and going forward with treatment to overcome it. That's why I think giving power to the person with SM through educating him on his illness and giving him control over his treatment is essential.

(Although it doesn\u2019t  physically prevent me from speaking)\n\nGrowing up there were certain situations where I\u2019d never talk. For example I played ice hockey during high school and I never talked... ever. I don\u2019t remember how I felt about talking, but I just remember not engaging with people. Our coach gave out \u201cmock awards\u201d, which were comical awards meant to make fun of people in good sprit. I won the \u201cHellen Keller\u201d award because I never talked in the four years I played.\n\nNow at the age of 25 I have a lot of problems with communication in certain situations. When I\u2019m surrounded by friends in a familiar situation I\u2019m able to freely talk. However in other situations I feel like a part of my brain turns off, like there is something blocking me. It doesn\u2019t stop me from speaking, but it does stop me from being able to come up with anything to say to people. I go blank so I\u2019m unable think of anything to start or chime into a conversation. If people try to talk to me, I\u2019m able to give a one word response maybe ( \u201ccool\u201d, \u201cthat sucks\u201d, \u201cnice\u201d), but I can\u2019t think of anything to say to continue the conversation. Again, it feels like there is something blocking me, or I go blank. It\u2019s like part of by brain turns off. I\u2019m also not able to focus in anything because half of my attention is focused internally, and the other half externally. \n\nI\u2019m not physically prevented from speaking. It\u2019s not like I have anything to say, but I\u2019m being blocked from talking. I\u2019m unable to come up with anything to say.\n\nIf I\u2019m in a loud or crowded places I usually have a bit of a sensory overload and I\u2019m unable to focus on anything. (I heard this could be a symptom). My friends say I look sad/have a blank expression on my face very often.\n\nBut anyway, growing up/ during my adolescence many people have described me as being a person who doesn\u2019t talk. It depended entirely on who I was surrounded by however. \n\nI don\u2019t say I have social anxiety because I don\u2019t fear social situations. I rarely think about rejection/how people perceive me in social situations. If i manage to say something I don\u2019t worry about how I was perceived.  I\u2019m just unable to think about anything in social situations; I tend to go blank. \n \nI want to stress that I\u2019m not physically unable to talk. And sometimes I do say a thing or two, or comment, but I rarely am able to engage in conversation in certain environments.\n\nWould this be selective mutism? I\u2019m just a bit confused because this is new to me.

Actually the term they used is family homeostasis but I think you see this response everywhere.  \n\nIn dysfunctional families, family homeostasis can mean sexual abuse, verbal and physical violence, alcoholism. It's the way things are. Even though the behaviors are objectively bad and obviously undesired by everyone they will still respond negatively when a member changes course in their behavior. So they \"keep each other down\". A psychologist talks about it more in depth in [this](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/matter-personality/201506/why-patients-borderline-personality-dont-get-better) article. This is how the family might respond specifically:\n\n&gt;As I said earlier, however, that would only be the first thing that would happen if someone with BPD started to act better. The next thing that happens is that the parents start to act out in alarming and frightening ways. I'm talking about such things as the parents making suicide threats or actual attempts, increasing their drug or alcohol abuse to higher and higher levels, worsening their level of domestic violence, throwing other family members out on the street\u00a0penniless, or abusing or\u00a0neglecting\u00a0any children left in the home. You know\u2014minor, inconsequential stuff.\n\nThis happened to me in my battle with SM. I was being kept sick by my family and only figured out what was happening in hindsight.\n\nI feel like it happened in school too. Any group I think is liable to react negatively to a change in someone's \"rank\", if you want to see it that way. [This](http://www.academicwomenforjustice.org/downloads/gentle-genocide.pdf) might be of interest to you if you want to read more about how a scientist was \"taken down\" in rank in a university setting. She went from a respected researcher to public enemy after she spoke out about sexual harassment. The process of progressively becoming someone who was verbally and emotionally abused on a daily basis, accused of a serious crime (against her nation I think) and eventually fired is explained. It's a phenomenon called mobbing.\n\nSo what I'm saying is... you might want to fight for more of a social life or since you have limited power and any attempts at getting better should be done in a safe setting you can just mostly keep your head down. I would actually advise that. Focus on just getting a handle on the basics. I think any changes you make should be attempted in the easiest, nicest setting possible most of the time and that might not be any of your current social settings. \n\nBack when my SM was really bad I consistently ended up in situations where I was interacting with bullies (a hell level of a social challenge) and failed miserably, could go completely silent, it was humiliating. In those situations, I sometimes felt like the people around me were just toying with me. It had long term effects on my self image I wish I'd avoided completely. It's okay if you're friendless and you struggle with your relationships with the staff. You're not just selectively mute, you also have to think of the overall quality of your relationships and their affect on your mental health.\n\nI wish I'd been more focused on how healthy my relationships were even if we were communicating through smoke signs. If you're likely to get a negative response when you attempt to open up, your anxiety will just get worse when you try again next time. Over the long term it can make your SM worse.\n\nI think a good first step you can be in complete control of is to talk to yourself. If you're able to, film yourself and when you watch it consciously try to be accepting and accommodating of your pauses, maybe quirky body language, anything you're self conscious of. It helps with your self image and convincing yourself there's nothing wrong with the way you communicate. I think it could be really empowering to just talk to yourself and be the first to be accepting and encouraging of yourself in making progress.

I\u2019ve lied about my \u2018social life\u2019 everywhere I go in both real life and online. \n\nI am a male 16 year old internationally born US resident. Yesterday, I stumbled across www.selectivemutismcenter.org, and after reading it, I wanted to cry. Like holy fucking shit, it hit me so hard right in my feelings. Every symptom for selective mutism, from eye contact when talking, to inner thoughts, matched up to my undiagnosed \u2018symptoms.\u2019\n\nYes, I\u2019m self-diagnosed, but now thinking back, I wish I was diagnosed a long time ago. I also believe I have PTSD from continuous physical and verbal abuse from a middle-aged man (who was not in my family) when I was in kindergarten. If I knew i had selective mutism earlier, I would\u2019ve started improving myself way earlier. Beginning of 2018 was when I first started to self-recover from undiagnosed SM because that was when I realized there was something wrong me\u2014yea it was when my friends had given up on me. I didn\u2019t want to be different, and I tried really hard for that. I am already improving, but I don\u2019t know if I can ever be *normal*\n\nI remember in kindergarten when other adults telling my parents about how quiet and obedient I am. My parents did not think I had any problems, and I think they still don\u2019t know. They think I\u2019m socializing at school. They think me chatting on Reddit is me talking to my irl friends. Oh my god if only they knew.\n\nI remember in first grade when i was put on a sports team, and my peers were talking about pop culture and toys, while I was too poor to be able to enjoy the luxuries they talk about. I remember that I blamed my parents in my thoughts for not buying me things, for not giving me toys for me to be able to have something to talk about with my peers.\n\nLater, my family and I moved to America. Here, at around age 9, I developed (self-diagnosed) severe depression from isolation. I don\u2019t think my parents knew. I attempted suicide three times, and survived. No one in my life but me knows about this. I am so fucking ashamed of it. Also, I just realized the only \u2018friends\u2019 I\u2019ve made at my first 4 elementary schools are probably autistic, as they were all outcasts with unique symptoms of autism (that I just realized\u2014I\u2019ve only wanted friends; I didn\u2019t care whom). The fact that I transferred 5 times in elementary school probably didn\u2019t help me either.\n\nAt a new elementary school, my teacher wanted my parents to have me test, because she thought I was too smart for school. Honestly I didn\u2019t think so, I was just *different* . I did pass the test though and joined the talented education system. However, even with the other \u2018talented\u2019 students, I never talked. These kids were nice though. They helped me enroll in all of these cool different programs, like band, that I still participate in to this day. They welcomed me even though I never talked. A simple \u201cthank you\u201d is what I want to say to them right now but as usual, I am too fucking ashamed to do that. \n\nIn high school, I only talked when answering questions and giving presentations. I loved presentations however, as it forced me to talk\u2014 which I couldn\u2019t/can\u2019t do in normal everyday conversations. I ran for student government president, because I wanted to prove everyone, including myself, that I *can* talk\u2014people were always amazed when I open my mouth, as I was/am the quiet kid.\n\nMy friends (I guess not really anymore) tried really hard to welcome and include me into their friend group. I always fucking chickened out even though I sincerely wanted to feel included. Now, they\u2019ve given up and don\u2019t anymore.\n\nI remember I was photo shy. Although I\u2019m not ugly (pretty good looking even), I avoided group photos because... I don\u2019t even know why actually.\n\nI looked at my mirror trying to talk, only to find out I look weird when I talk\u2014I don\u2019t really even move my lips when I talk. Right now, I\u2019m trying to make myself talk on discord, but that\u2019s not really helping, as I don\u2019t talk in the voice chats, and instead, I listen and type.\n\nNow I\u2019m in college. College gives me a chance to start over, to self-improve without shame. And I love college for that. I tried to talk as much as possible, to force myself to talk. As a result, I went to clubs, ran for officer positions, and got some of them. I still can\u2019t talk normally though. I wish I knew how. Just three months ago, I thought I had ADHD because you know, I am different, so I took the ADHD test anonymously at my college. The result came back negative: I did not have ADHD.  I thought I had something else. Honestly I\u2019m almost certain I have selective mutism, and I will talk to my doctor about this next checkup (which is in about a year)\n\nDo you guys know if I\u2019ll ever be able to talk normally and hold a conversation? I\u2019m so fucking boring in life, and I want to change that. When my parents ask me a question or talk to me, I don\u2019t reply even though I can. It has become second nature to me, to ignore people. I want to change that. Oh my god I want to cry now again\n\nSorry for the rant, and thanks if you\u2019ve read this far. Good luck you guys as well, hopefully you guys can reach your goals of talking in life better than I can.

I was talking to a guy my age who lives abroad, I told him about my situation and he asked me \u2018so there\u2019s no one you even text on a daily, weekly basis?\u2019 and my loneliness hit me so hard. Everyone has someone they talk to. I know a person I can only describe as \u2018very damaged\u2019 and she still has a few people she talks to. I talk to absolutely no one. Anything I feel has to stay inside me and it melts my fucking soul im so miserable.

I don\u2019t have any single target, I have a few but they\u2019re all girls so that looks weird but I swear to God all the boys around me are extremely hypermasculine tryhards who can\u2019t hold a deep conversation.

I just run on the maybe; maybe my life will turn around someday...something will cause it to. I'm just confused to how everything in my life, ended to this point. Maybe I'll be triggered to want the opposite.\n\n\\*I am constantly living with this, I know of everything, I'm self-aware. I wasn't as conscious of it going through school, though I'm out of school....now I'm in college, which I more so go to because my Mom will otherwise make me get a job, although I never want a job until I'm ready to have one, whenever that will be. *I don't want to be put in that situation as I am now.* \n\nI stay in college to avoid my Mom's thinkings, because really I believe time is more valuable than college...but ofc that is ironic as I waste my time. And even the 'professional' suggests that maybe I could apply to something, but how? I don't want to be put in a situation where I am unable to handle it, if I need to handle it. Until I'm able to be in the situation without worry, I'm not going to worry.\n\nAs life goes now....*I really don't know what I was about to say...and now I'm going to go eat cause I'm being harrased, I just knew when I want to write something, I write it now....though could've been thought out better but.*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 6084, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "19-I'll put this on the Reddit instead of Discord cause I feel like it...sure", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/sc168z/19ill_put_this_on_the_reddit_instead_of_discord/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "pangeafan1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_idc5frk1", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1643005745, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/sbfg9t/is_it_me_or_whenever_you_go_nonverbal_in/", "gildings": {}, "id": "sbfg9t", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/sbfg9t/is_it_me_or_whenever_you_go_nonverbal_in/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1643005756, "score": 1, "selftext": "Like I don't know.

I remember always trying to get out of oral presentations, sometimes faking strep throat or saying I didn't do the project at all and taking the F. Even in my high school years when I could identify my problem as anxiety, teachers did not sympathize at all and basically just told me to get over it. If you were called on and didn't say anything or went \"Uhhh...\" sometimes they'd mock you, which made it worse and made me more anxious. \n\nI was friendless and bullied for most of those years. A few years ago, my dad said it really hurt him to drop me off at school and see me walk into the building because my body language was completely deflated and defeated every day. \n\nWhen I finished my \"ugly duckling\" phase and entered high school, people wanted to be my friend. I was told all the time \"I thought you were weird/a bitch/rude/conceited because you never spoke.\" Because I never really had friends and especially not close friends, I was desperate to fit in and hang onto them. I pretty much did whatever they said and did. A lot of drugs and drinking, which actually made me a lot less mute and anxious. But because it helped, I stopped going to school sober, then stopped going entirely. \n\nMy dad sent me to a new school pretty far away, so I didn't know a soul. My mutism was at its worst during this time and the closest I came to speaking was mouthing a reply when I was asked something. I felt physical pain when I'd try to speak and that was new to me. Sometimes I'd just start crying, and it was so fucking embarrassing. Aaaand then I dropped out for good. \n\nSo, that's how school was for me in regards to SM. Can anyone relate to what I've said?

What if I decide to just stop talking? \nWhen I was younger (14-15) I decided to stop talking for around half a year or so. Just didn't speak to anyone. I still wrote and used a children version of sign language in my country.\nBecause of me not speaking and other stuff my parents put me in a mental hospice.\nThere I met one girl which during those months was the only one I talked to and even then it was here and there, and only when we were alone. And the only reason for that is because she had an anime voice she hid and used a fake voice (she was able to initiate other voices easily due to a medical condition caused by her mother) and her sharing it with me caused me to share me speaking with her.\n\nAfter a few months I got out of there and started studying in a boarding school. But after a month or so there the principal made an demand; either I start talking or I get kicked out. That eventually forced me back into talking. (Without me actually bring interested in doing so. I didn't want to live at home, and wanted to live at a boarding school for a while beforehand. Didn't want to give it up)\n\n\n\n\nAnyways. Reason I'm asking is because I never really looked into that. I was just like yeah that happened. Idk why but that felt like what I should do. Don't want to talk.\nOver the years I still prefered being quiet and when upset I could stop talking for a day or a few (many times people ignored the fact that I didn't want to talk and wanted to be alone and left by myself which just made it worse in my opinion.)\nCurrently I'm having family issues. And due to those family issues I decided that I no longer want to speak to my mother. So I just don't.\nThat, alongside the fact my dad wants to see if I have Asperger's syndrome and me talking to my friend, made me wonder and google about selective mutism, which is apparently a severe form of anxiety? Didn't know about that but I guess that explains the anxiety meds I take.\nBut in what I found it says that the people are unable to talk, not choose not to talk.\nSo after this all long and useless post probably... Is selective mutism just people bring unable to talk, or also people choosing to stop talking?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 6048, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is selective mutism also people choosing not to talk?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/s4mm76/is_selective_mutism_also_people_choosing_not_to/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hallowhelen1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_86yhuh86", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642238007, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/s4gf4n/what_it_depends_on_where_and_who_isare_people_or/", "gildings": {}, "id": "s4gf4n", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/s4gf4n/what_it_depends_on_where_and_who_isare_people_or/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642238017, "score": 1, "selftext": "And can you select the situations and people who and where you can talk or it isn't your choose?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 6049, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What it depends on where and who is/are people or situations that who and where can talk with?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/s4gf4n/what_it_depends_on_where_and_who_isare_people_or/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Relevant-Hunter8441", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hfhhl4iv", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642225883, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/s4dan8/selective_mutism_with_family/", "gildings": {}, "id": "s4dan8", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "389d6cec-937f-11e9-9d30-0e6c3cf3f1f6", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/s4dan8/selective_mutism_with_family/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642225894, "score": 1, "selftext": "From the posts I've seen here, it seems like most people are comfortable speaking at home, but in outside situations like school they can't speak. \n\nI feel like I'm the opposite since I can speak at school somewhat but I can't speak comfortably to my family outside of one person.

years.\n\nHe is highly intelligent (he got a place to study Mathematics at Warwick UK - if you don't take my word for it I guess) and the two of us once shared a close relationship growing up. One term he came home from university and never went back - our mum wasn't happy and they argued, it was almost as though he was giving her the silent treatment when it first started, but it never stopped. At this time myself and my older brother lived away from home and didn't understand the extent of it. For the first few years of his isolation I didn't understand what was going on with him - I still don't, in a way - and tried my best to engage him to no avail. \n\nOur father was an alcoholic and the dynamic in our family was always strained. At first none of us knew what to do and my folks hired in multiple therapists to try and 'fix' things. It was a different time I guess, obviously none of it touched the sides,\n\nAbout 5 years in or so we learned of Hikikomori, which made the most sense. But it really wasn't heard of in the UK in 2010. Mental health specialists we spoke to at the time told us they'd never heard of such a thing - as they mostly do today. However, the term resonated with us as a way to explain the way Owain was acting or reacting to life. \n\nThe world is a more understanding and accepting place now than it was - ha, in some respects. I've learned a lot more about mental illness and neurodivergence. But what I really need right now is some sort of insight. Someone who understands him, or me. Or at least to not feel so alone and helpless in all of this.\n\nI love my brother and want to help him but I don't know how. I don't even know if that is possible now, its been so long. Life is short and meaningless but it shouldn't have to feel this hard. \n\nIf you have any experience of this or anything you think could help, please reach out.\n\nSusie", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 6008, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hikikomori Brother UK - Please Help", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/rze03t/hikikomori_brother_uk_please_help/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "XeniaY", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ne8zy", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1641681937, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/rzc9rp/just_watched_the_film_the_piano_and_cried_has/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rzc9rp", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/rzc9rp/just_watched_the_film_the_piano_and_cried_has/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1641681948, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 6007, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just watched the film the Piano and cried.

It was difficult when he was first born (I ended up always whispering to people I could normally talk to when the baby was in the room, kept getting told to speak up despite being right next to the other person, it didn\u2019t even feel that quiet to me so it felt like having to force myself to shout in normal conversations) but after working on it for a while it has gotten easier to talk around him now. I\u2019m currently trying to work on talking to him (or even just looking at him while talking to someone else), rather than just around him, and while I can do it sometimes it still feels extremely wrong while I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m not sure if the fact he\u2019s a baby has any impact on it, I\u2019m sure he probably doesn\u2019t care or have much understanding about what I\u2019m actually saying yet, but it\u2019s still difficult for a socially inexperienced person who isn\u2019t much good at leading a conversation to talk to a baby who doesn\u2019t talk back. At the same time, that could be making it easier, as it\u2019s less about saying the right thing (although it does still bother me) and more about just talking.\n\nI used to be able to talk to some of my cousins on my mums side, we didn\u2019t see them all the time, but I guess it was often enough. I\u2019m not really sure at which point it changed or why, but it\u2019s really hard to talk to them now. It\u2019s really awkward when we see them because the older of the two (I think he\u2019s about 7 or 8 now) always tries to talk to me and he tends to hug people as a goodbye (which is really out of my comfort zone, although he doesn\u2019t do it to me as much now so I must come off awfully weird and unfriendly). He usually ends up asking his mum (his dad isn\u2019t the best) why I wont talk to him every time and I always feel so bad about it, she always says something along the lines of \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to and you can\u2019t make people do things they don\u2019t want to.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if she actually knows about the SM and I get it\u2019s easier to explain it that way but to a child it must look like I hate him if I never \u201cwant\u201d to talk to him.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to end up being that person who tries to ignore their siblings existence because I\u2019m not comfortable around them, especially since I still live with them. It\u2019s difficult to explain to a child why someone can\u2019t talk and I do still want to have a good relationship with them, rather than looking like I hate them.\n\nI\u2019ve also read somewhere that it might be possible to learn anxiety traits in childhood from people your around often, I\u2019m not sure if it actually happens or how likely it is, but I wouldn\u2019t want him to learn SM from me and end up with a similar lifestyle. I also have OCD and it\u2019s probably possible for him to learn compulsions as \u201cnormal\u201d behaviours even if he doesn\u2019t develop OCD himself.\n\nDoes anyone else here have any experience with with baby\u2019s/children?

I\u2019m laying in bed at 5:45 in the morning, unable to sleep for the last few hours. Lately I\u2019ve been curious about neurodivergence (specifically adhd/asd) and bouts of mutism. So I did a little googling and I read the definition of selective mutism and lo and behold it fits me to a T. When I was a kid, I was just called shy. When I got a little older I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and social anxiety. As a young adult I was diagnosed with PTSD. I\u2019m curious as to why, in all my years of therapy, in all my describing the blankness in my head when faced with an anxiety provoking situation (especially when I was in school), no therapist ever suggested I may have SM. If someone had suggested this, I may have been able to seek specific treatment. Instead, I\u2019m 30 years old and still can\u2019t hold a conversation with a stranger because my mind goes white and I stare at them blankly.

At that time, that was my main concern as opposed to my anxiety, which is definitely the priority now.\n\nAnyway, I went to this psychiatrist who was.. let's say.. not that good at his job. I went in with my mom looking for something to help with my unending sadness, and she mentioned my anxiety. I was expecting you know, anxiety/depression medication but this guy literally prescribed me an antipsychotic which my mom told him someone in my family had a history of addiction to. So that was odd. He also prescribed me other things, all in very low doses yet still not any type of anti anxiety or anti depressants. That's not really the weird part though.\n\nThis guy asked questions in a kinda stern way, which to me felt pretty threatening. My mom answered for me, which we didn't think would be a problem because we made it very clear that I had told her prior to every appointment what to say to him. But at every single appointment, he kept saying, \"She needs to talk. I need to hear that from her. There's no way for me to help if she doesn't tell me herself.\" and looking back on that.. I feel pretty manipulated and very uncomfortable knowing that someone in that field didn't even.. suggest the possibility that I was mute? I wasn't diagnosed at all at this time, and I obviously wasn't talking. My mom told him that I am an anxious person too. Wouldn't mutism be the first thing on your mind? It was just really weird.\nHe also had this really pushy thing where he was like, \"I can't help you until she gets therapy. She needs to get therapy. She needs to be able to talk to me so I can help her.\" Like.. Isn't that.. oddly forceful?\n\nNowadays I have a new psychiatrist, which I got about... 3-4 years after that incident who is so much nicer. I am so happy about that. I haven't talked to her at all, yet it is completely fine. She prescribed me an actual anxiety medication, unlike someone..... And my mom told her about my old psychiatrist and she also said that the things he did were strange. It was very funny and relieving to hear her say things like \"Oh gosh.. I would never prescribe that for her. a\nAnd, frankly... I don't know anyone who would.\" \ud83d\udc80\n\nHer demeanor is so calm and refreshing when I compare her to him \ud83d\ude07 Glad to say I feel way better now than I did back then \ud83d\ude09", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5986, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Awful Psychiatrist Experience", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/rvns1f/awful_psychiatrist_experience/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "VioletThePurple", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "0ab735ee-8171-11e9-8a25-0ef95564d0f4", "author_flair_text": "Diagnosed SM", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3le6sw48", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1641262578, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/rvivfr/school_is_tomorrow/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rvivfr", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "389d6cec-937f-11e9-9d30-0e6c3cf3f1f6", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/rvivfr/school_is_tomorrow/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1641262589, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was only informed today.

About 1/2 or 1 year ago I finally got the chance to see a psychologist so that we could determine whether I had mild autism or SM. (These two are often confused) Autism was the main topic of discussion because I had kind of tricked myself into thinking I had it, although SM was always pretty obvious.\nFor reference to how I felt that day: During the test there was a thing with blocks where I had to arrange them so that the patterns matched some pictures. I remember my hands shaking so badly, which is not usual for me.\n***The story actually starts here.\nMy mom is psychologically educated and has taught AP Psychology at a High School for over 15 years. This is relevant. Anyways, after a very anxious 2 hour appointment of me being fully analyzed, the psychologist brought my mom into the room. The psychologist told us that I had Selective Mutism, and I felt a wave of disappointment and relief was over me. (The disappointment being from the fact that it didn't explain my personality quirks like I thought an Autism Diagnosis would.) She explained very eloquently what I had been going through my whole life, explaining how my depression was very connected to my SM. I was nearly crying, maybe I was already, I'm not sure. So she had explained mostly (I think), saying normal symptoms of SM, etc, and my mom interrupted. She said, \"isn't that a choice though?\"\nI literally felt my heart shatter as the psychologist said \"You think it's a choice?\" As her eyes got all big in legitimate surprise. She then explained very thoroughly how it isn't a choice, that it is being frozen in such fear that you can't even lift your tongue or open your mouth. That's when I started crying harder, because my mom, who I thought knew me, seemed to be less aware of how I felt than this stranger who only knew as much about me as my parents had told her and all of the information from my 2hr appointment. I was in the most shock I've ever been in. I felt so betrayed. \nThen. DAYS LATER. My mom and I were walking around the neighborhood, talking, and I mentioned what she had said. Then she was simply like \"Oh, I was testing her.\" In my head I just went *what, the, f*ck.* \nThen I told her how bad that made me feel and she apologized and explained that she just wanted to make sure the psychologist was aware enough of Selective Mutism to explain the 'choice' concept to a 'confused' parent. Never knew my mom could be so manipulative lmao. I'm still surprised to this day.\nP.S. Everything worked out and my mom thought it would be obvious that she was testing her. She really did apologize a lot so that's okay \ud83e\udd27\n*Also ask me anything you want about the experience, my life, etc. I will answer as best as I can.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5981, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Odd Diagnosis Experience...", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/ruf5ax/odd_diagnosis_experience/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "invisibledandelion", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_iv19j77", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1641059709, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/rtohhl/does_this_sound_like_selective_mutismplease_help/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rtohhl", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "346468e2-937f-11e9-82f2-0eccdc050e9e", "link_flair_text": "Help", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/rtohhl/does_this_sound_like_selective_mutismplease_help/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1641059719, "score": 1, "selftext": "I dont know how to talk.I mostly cant think of anything to say,especially in groups.I can make small talk,I can talk to people when I need something.But I cant talk other than that.Like I only speak when I am spoken to and I cant make long talks.I cant,for example,explain an event thats happened to me or tell a story.I can only speak in one or two sentences at most.In group gatherings it is waaay worse.I cant talk at all.My brain freezes and it is blank.No words inside.I can only follow the conversation.I cant make banter,make jokes or sincere talks with someone.For a long time i thought it was social anxiety,but now I realize it is more than that.Because I notice this happening with my own family and friends.Please help me.Is there some kind of therapy focusing on this?

Are there ethical and legal challenges that have come up in relation to SM?\n\nSince there is a gap in the literature, there is no better place to ask than Reddit!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5871, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "psychotherapist trainee - cannot find any literature on SM in adults!???", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/rd5ifb/psychotherapist_trainee_cannot_find_any/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "catpamd", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gze5zlei", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1639066616, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/rcl00r/how_can_i_know_if_is_sm_or_poor_selfesteem_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rcl00r", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/rcl00r/how_can_i_know_if_is_sm_or_poor_selfesteem_the/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1639066627, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5862, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How can I know if is SM or poor self-esteem the reason for not speak up?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/rcl00r/how_can_i_know_if_is_sm_or_poor_selfesteem_the/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "epic_rustography8215", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7yo7mvzr", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1639040416, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/rcdqzu/what_causes_sm/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rcdqzu", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "346468e2-937f-11e9-82f2-0eccdc050e9e", "link_flair_text": "Help", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/rcdqzu/what_causes_sm/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1639040426, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm 39 and I'm pretty sure I have SM.

If I wanted to try to speak, eventually I could. Or at least speak to her in time. As much as that's ironic because the person it's hardest for to understand it all, is her; it's hard for her to understand that I do have the ability to be able to speak (I do have the ability to break that mental block); she doesn't see that. She doesn't see me breaking that mental block without the use of SSRI medicines. \n\nShe also wants to tear down a wall in the room I reside in, which idc about wall necessarily.....but I do care. I care because if I wanna eventually play the new Xbox Series X in this room and start socializing on there with friends again, I NEED that wall there...or else talking will not commence. I will stay mute if they have the ability to hear me that clearly, and I will probably avoid gaming entirely if they can see me doing it. I have Contamination OCD to not sleep in my room, or ever really go in there besides changing and playing Xbox (which is rare).....but once I get the new Xbox Series X (and this was always my plan since before it released), I wanted to play it on the 4K HDR TV in the room I reside in, no matter what.......but my Mom focuses on trying to solve both of my problems........but you can't solve both problems; not at the same time. She doesn't give my OCD much credit, she thinks it's unreasonable...but to me it is anything but unreasonable.\n\nIf she tears down that wall, kiss my own avenue (only one atm) to speaking to friends, or friends all-together goodbye, I'd have to find something entirely new, and new friends because if I never play Xbox again, I'll probably never talk to them again. For speaking, she just focuses on getting me to somehow get onto medication, but I do not want to. It's redundant. \n\nI have no motivation to speak anywhere else besides on Xbox (and it's not even motivation on Xbox), even when I did speak in the Xbox Live parties with my friends (that speaking ability translated to IRL, naturally...). Idk, why? With them it seemed like my SM really just disappeared; although it was still there in ways, just not really as strong as anywhere else. It also didn't feel like 'fighting my SM'.....it just basically didn't exist there. So as much as I was \"changing my SM there\"......change never translated to anywhere else. Yes, I could speak to those friends, but at the same instance when I tried to order food while out with them (and I only ever ordered sodas to keep it minimal).....They once had to order it for me, as the Taco Bell lady could not understand me. That friend is a real G. They're all maybe not super-understanding (in the literal sense), but they don't really care to knock whatever they may think is up with me. I'll never forget the people who've stepped in over the years.\n\nAnd I would've much rather played Wizard101's new Update (Lemuria) tonight, instead of thinking about this or talking to my Mom....and whenever I talk to my mom, she can never perceive what I say to her correctly. She perceives it how she wants to, and I can't change that.....because as much as I can talk to her, I can't talk to her in any way that would be effective......beyond what I do; which is minimal.\n\nAnd I want her to stop focusing on the medicine, I want her to just focus on me eventually talking. And I do not want to focus on talking, I would rather avoid it....but if I'm not pushing myself, they have to push me. I want to talk to my family first. For her to push this goal of me 'picking-up food'....that annoys me, because to me talking to my family is more prominent. And I hate picking up food, it's more difficult because I KNOW my family KNOWS I'm going to do it, while I'm out doing it.....as it's something I specifically am told to go do.....(if I want to do it), and they are specifically aware of me doing it.\n\nWhich in the summer I did want to pick up food, and I did do it. Though it's still hard to talk to those people.....but if I could talk to my family, I feel like it'd be less tolling on me to go out and pick-up food, since one side of it all would be closed off.\n\nI have a lot of thoughts, and I probably missed a few, but it's hard to remember. But I want that Xbox and the room to play it in without worry. I think, \"maybe something will come from it\".....and I am MUCH more afraid/mad at/of the inability to play that Xbox (for the purpose of having some avenue to more properly communicate).....than not being able to play the Xbox (for games, the games are not as important). Although I'd love to play Call of Duty again (first one was BO2), but my internet always sucked, so I could never get too serious.\n\nMaybe I'll have to tell her that about the wall, and about the Xbox....BUT then she tries to make it about the room and my OCD there....she tries to fix me everywhere, when it's just damaging me in both areas by doing so. If she knocks down this wall, I will probably not play Xbox for.....until we move.....which will probably never happen, or until I get my own place, which if I don't learn how to communicate, will probably never happen. I KNOW everything and how everything affects me, I guess me being \"unbothered\" by the circumstance of my life, is incomprehensible to my Mom, but it's just the way it is........unless I wanna break down everyday; you sort of have to be unbothered...or at least try to be. I am bothered, I just can't be or I'll be a wreck. I hate the things I can't do, and at the same time I'm afraid to do those things.\n\nI do have an Xbox One in my room, and I will play that in my room still, but it's quieter restrictive talking because people can hear me through the door....and the OCD keeps me very stuck to the chair in my room (literally), and not much of anywhere besides that chair. Also my Xbox One has been basically a broken/dead console (mine in particular) for the last 3 years, and I play so infrequently now, I have to sit up there for 3 hours just updating every time, and sitting in that room makes me feel SO TRAPPED. I hate it so fucking much, and that's why I avoid it. That room is where my OCD started from, I remember back in 6th grade I would just have to check out the door like 5 times in a row....that was nothing from where it stands now. In time I stopped having to check out that door. Now it's not a simple; having to do something over and over and over again to make sure it's correct in your mind....\n\nThis OCD though, I'm more afraid of it getting worse, than anything. I just find that room VERY uncomfortable, and I do not like staying in it. As it is now, I find it abhorrent to be in that room for longer than I need to be.\n\nIt sucks complete asshole, that I can't get an Xbox Series X. I wanted it that first christmas, and now it's the second one....and you still can't get it. I'd be willing to spend the money to get one off Ebay, but it'd have to be my money, and I only have so much, once it's out it's out....and as much as it's unrealistic now, I kind of want some in there, so I could just ditch everybody and take my money and run, although I would never do that..........if I could have some sort of income, I would spend the money, I would get a Scuf or Elite controller too, and a new Headset cause this Turtle Beach hurts my head...some Astros. Probably the elite controller for everything. Money means nothing to me, but I don't want to be stuck without it....although really I have no access to my money, because my mom is the one who set up my bank account password, I never bothered (at 18, 19 now....she is a on there as a secondary...I would prefer she wasn't. I don't trust her). And again no income so as much as I don't care, I also don't care to completely deplete my money....\n\nMaybe I'd get the Xbox Series S, but it performs worse, and for the money you could get the X....I also already have 2 discs for the Series X....so it's a conundrum, and eventually I would want the X for the superior performance. If the performance of each console was identical, I'd just go for the S....I would ALSO, get a 120HZ 4K monitor with low response time....but that's my perfect set-up, which I have never had.\n\nI have more thoughts and I said that already, but I can't think of them. I wanna go back to playing Wizard101 now. Thank you. Though I have to write this down, otherwise...it's for nothing. And it calms me down better when all my Mom talks of is this dystopian future I'll live if I continue (NO FUCKING SHIT.......I'm well aware)........god damn. Just spent from 7:30pm to 10:46pm focusing on this....that's annoying, but idk. It's the only time I think about it. \n\nIt'd be easy to just flip the screen at my Mom and show her this, but I also don't wanna potentially die inside. But these are my desires, I guess.....not the life-long desires, but the now desires.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5852, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I was forced to talk to my Mom about SM, so writing down my thoughts.

And if anybody reads, or even read the post which is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/eawrmv/a_story_on_why_i_didnt_talk_to_you/ \n\nI\u2019d be open to giving an update on myself or talking, but once my post is deleted I plan to delete this account along with this post.

I told them all multiple times that she has selective mutism and doesn\u2019t talk much, sometimes not at all. My sisters understood, but not so much my parents. I don\u2019t think they understood that when I told them she doesn\u2019t talk much that *she really really doesn\u2019t talk much*. My mom kept making sly comments about my gf\u2019s weight (she has an ED) and kept giving me this *look*, like she was trying to figure out why the hell I brought this girl home. My gf didn\u2019t really pick up on it as much as me bc she was zoned out but I was really protective and felt attacked enough for her. My mom even went so far as to look at my gf and ask almost incredulously *\u201chow old are you?\u201d*, like she thought something was wrong with her and my gf looked shocked but later told me she just thought it was funny. \n\nI\u2019m just glad my gf didn\u2019t notice as much as me because it might have overwhelmed her more than she already was. When we\u2019re alone, she talks to me so much and I\u2019m one of the few that she can talk the ears off of. She\u2019s beautiful and smart and kind and just because she can\u2019t talk sometimes doesn\u2019t mean a single thing is wrong with her. Not to mention she\u2019s got to speak in English, which isn\u2019t even her native language (although she\u2019s fluent). \n\nI just want my family to understand and I don\u2019t think what I\u2019ve told them is sticking. I want to talk to them again about it, because my gf isn\u2019t going anywhere and I love her. My gf and I have my sister\u2019s baby shower to go to this weekend and a lot of people will be there.

It's locked because of the wall....and you're getting angry? It fucks with me.\n\nAnd now she's yelling at me for telling her to leave.......you see, I have no motivation to tell her why I am annoyed at her, because she asked 'what's wrong?'.................there's a lot wrong, I just have 0 motivation to translate what, to her.........she doesn't understand that I can't translate anything like that. It's just damaging.\n\nThe time I did progress was when I had the motivation to, that was the summer (and I ALWAYS mention the summer, if anyone pays attention to me in particular)...it was just the one time, I had the motivation above anything else to want communication in my life.....even if it meant being uncomfortable. I know I can speak, it's not hard.........well it is. Just in my mind; it doesn't take that long if to fully speak if the motivation was there. I believe in a day, I could start speaking fully. There's no want to, and it would definitely be uncomfortable as fuck, but I always know that I could....Though, what happens if I do? I feel like if I did, how does that sudden change affect me? I don't have a concept of it.\n\nThe time I had motivation was from June 28th to about August 1st is when it was gone........this girl approached my family and I, in the Target parking lot. late at night....just a family trip in my car, casually. So she was going to write a note, but she didn't. She just spoke to us. I guess she wanted to speak to whoever owned the car, and that was \"me\" (my Dad actually does).....so my Mom pointed to me, and wanted me to speak to her...but talking doesn't work like that, so I just nod and deflect but, just from the start of it all........when she came out of her car (she had just whipped into the spot next after spotting my car)...that girl was the PRETTIEST fucking girl I've seen in my entire life. Then she said she had owned the same car, her brother texted her that \"her car\" was at Target...and she wanted to talk about it. But that all never happened. It was awkward because she had to talk to my Mom and brother, and they don't know that much about cars. I was never nervous though, idk usually I am with girls. There was a level of trust there that usually nobody gives, and it was so refreshing...........of course in the moment, I never picture anything more. I never have, I didn't when I liked the first girl I ever did in 7th grade....or when I kind of liked someone other girl, later.\n\nLiterally she was stopping us to give us car parts, she was leaving for Florida the next day, so she lead us back to her house with her car. She was going to give us parts from her old car (she owned the exact car I had) for free. On the way there everyone was like 'this is the perfect girl for you...,' and so on...........but for me, even 19. I can't picture doing that........but I almost was allowed to, I've always been conscious of that. My Mom told me to come out to say 'thank you,' but I never did...she just got the parts from her, and that was that, I sat in the drivers seat waiting, and my sibling are disappointed I didn't go out. Besides a phone number she gave my Mom, she got to exchange pictures. Idk I think there were other reasons why she got the number, but idk....and my Sister is now talking with this boy (she's 16)...and having him over, and it's casual, but for me, I just can't picture it. IT was just the talk of the night after we got home, ofc then it was brought up a few other times, and I never said no to pursuing something, but I wouldn't know how...someone would have to push me, and even then idk how that would work....when.....it just wouldn't work.\n\nAnd it was only until the last 3 weeks that I've stopped feeling anything towards that girl, and I know that's creepy. But it's honest. Though it was only a month in, that's when I lost that motivation or hope of anything more than that night....which was really nothing more than a good deed.\n\nThe rest of the summer I was just in this euphoric hope, but now I look at it, as dumb. August comes and everyone gets Covid, and the summer basically ends there. It was a very family oriented summer.....Idk, but since then I just really have no motive, to speak. For a while, I was just sad as a Bitch. Now I'm just sort of indifferent, not really super happy like I was at times during that Euphoric time....but equally then, I was VERY sad too. I could've just gone to the beach with my family then, and that made me EXTREMELY happy, and I know when I am that happy, I am just THAT fucking happy. I know that happiness and motive exists, it's just not present anymore.\n\nI haven't been that happy, since though. Now I just stay away from everyone most of the day, besides the time they invade the room, I reside in.\n\nThere's been no real progress since July, and I will only count July as the most progressive time of my life. Every sense of 'progress' made since, is this sliver of false hope by others, I don't count it because it's a one time thing when it happens; a spur of some motive to say something. I only speak when I have motive to.\n\nI don't believe anyone in my family, to understand what this is; in a capacity that's good enough to help me in anyway meaningful, it was only the time when I had my own motive, I went out of my own way for the first time since SM really became a problem. I went out and picked up food for my family, and that KILLED ME inside, but I wanted to do it, I figured it will feel that way, until eventually it won't. I saw what you guys were saying...but it was never enough time for me to see any change in how I felt. I just eventually lost my motivation to want to continue fighting.................When my SM became a huge problem, it was Middle school. In elementary school, really about Kindergarten, or 1st grade was the ideal time to tackle this. If it was known or understood....maybe it'd be no problem now, idk? I don't think it was ever known, but it wasn't ever questioned why I spoke at such a minimal rate my entire life. Until it was.....and I think that was around middleschool, but it was never something my parents involved me in, I was unaware of what I had until highschool I think, I just casually get told one day....\"you have SM...\" Oh, ok...........I had no clue what that was. \n\nSo from then on they get teachers to try to get me to speak more in highschool, but I push it off as a joke....because I don't wanna be associated as such, and they eventually stop trying. I managed to make friends by standing out I guess....I initially made my elementary friends by myself, I actually had my first friends, who were these 2 girls, and they bought snacks for me....and joked with me, I would eat the crackers I had for lunch and one of them went how 'it's like my brother's underwear,' so I always remember that....but one day I ditched them because I thought 'it was uncool to be friends with girls....' When I became friends with my \"best-friend.\"\n\nReally I can't re-call that 'best-friendship' much, and it was from earlier in elementary school until 7th grade of middleschool, then we grew apart, but I can't remember much....not when it came to communicating with them. And my second friend group in middleschool, I hung out with them a lot, but it was really the same thing with communication, besides Xbox, where I did speak more to them.............in highschool I managed to get into my 3rd group of friends....and really ALL of these friend groups had recurring friends over due time.....idk I was definitely not the kid most would associate with, I guess they thought I was weird, most of my 'friends' were more mutual and they'd make jokes.....but the usual ones, it didn't bother me.....some were hostile and I stayed away, but nothing out of hand. I actually had a YouTube channel where pretty much anyone who knew of it, heard my voice....but I still never spoke in school. And my family has no clue about that channel, and never will.\n\nThe only people I did talk to somewhat normally, were my highschool friends since I was so social with them on Xbox, although still limited in ways. I hung out with them a few times (last time in 2019), but I became known to not really ever.....hang out. Now I just never get asked. It's been since 2019 since I've really played Xbox consistently and I wanna get back into it, but idk it's stressful in ways....since I haven't normally conversed with anyone and I'll only ever get close to that conversing... over Xbox and nowhere else in my life......besides xbox, and that friend group.....though there were still limitations, the most i ever spoke in a REAL group face to face setting was with that friend group.......it was just fine to do, I may've never really sparked any conversation, but if I had it was anywhere it was with that group. Though even then I had no real motive to try and speak outside of that group, or who had tagged along. But they don't know what I have....they know 'I'm mute' but they don't really understand it.....not to my knowledge, they're chill though, and I respect them a lot. One kind of reminds you of FaZe Rain....the way he speaks.\n\nNo where else or since.\n\nIf I try to speak more, it'll just be out of the will of nothing....and it's hard to pull something out of nothing. MAYBE if I knew what the 'otherside' was like, I'd want in. But there are no drives besides the ones I mentioned. And I know lust or love isn't a sturdy base for motivation, and it's not easy to re-create. That was the second girl I ever was REALLY intoxicated by, and the last time was about 6 years before........I don't find motivation in anything simple. I don't see the end-goal as something to strive for, which would be being able to communicate.\n\nOf course, I have FOMO (I'll use that phrase) of my lack of being able to communicate. At the mall with my Mom, Sister, and Brother this last Friday (so Black Friday)....we went to this \"comic-store\" (not a comic store) and it was just cool, I saw a Juice WRLD shirt on the wall, and I really have come to like Juice WRLD in the last few months, unreleased songs and all. I just really relate to it, and nothing else. I wanted in....but at the same time I would never wear anything like that, but I want to....but I'm also afraid to. I fear my Dad in that he is just overly judgy, maybe he isn't deep down but on the surface he judges everything and anything, it's annoying as all fuck.....my music taste is actually unknown to my family (besides old rock, which is EH....because I relate more to Juice WRLD...and other shit, when I'm not only listening to Juice WRLD, sometime in the future)....And I am VERY annoyed and just want my Dad to go away everyday, we used to go driving in his cars on the weekends and we haven't in about a month and a half. He hasn't asked.\n\nI also went to a Jonas Brothers concert at night (I write about everyday, so THANK GOD, I can re-live it as much as I want to), and I've been to concerts before with my Dad, to classic rock concerts....and they're great, I love the music, I can appreciate it....but I HAVE NEVER BEEN to a fucking young person concert until then, that was October I think, it was just the best night. Every one was singing to the songs just playing on the speakers, and it was fun. I will always remember that night, and I just \"happened\" to be the one to go since my other sister couldn't, or didn't want to.....My older sister brought me, and it was just us two, but it was just great.  I dig the Jonas Brothers, they're fun...and all that 2000 music, Hannah Montana...it's nostalgic and a great time period.\n\nAt the same time I want everything that I long, to love. I am disturbed by myself for partaking, and of what others will think of my likings, or really what I'll feel when they know of what I actually like........I like a ton of shit, I would LOVE to be able to actually play Juice WRLD while showering, but I just play nothing. That other self scares me, as much as part of me...is that self. Maybe that's the more true self, idk. I also love Ariana Grande, or at least for a long period of a year or two....now I just listen to Juice WRLD cause I relate to it. And maybe I'd actually like to buy Merch of both, but I can't. I liked Logic for a short period post Everything....but eh...\n\nEven back to Xbox, the last time I was on it, I can no longer speak super loud....my family used to be able to hear me from everywhere and I never really was effected by that, I even SCREAMED the loudest in my entire life in a rage at my friends for killing me in Minecraft, very serious business. But now, I haven't spoken at a normal level that can be heard much beyond my own door, and I keep my music in my headphones lower, so it doesn't go through the door. I wish I had a sound-proof room where I could just do what I did, without anyone else listening in, I also wish that with driving and music, that only I could hear it....And I don't really care on the road with music, but at lights I do. Also I feel like I'm a danger on the road because other people just freak me out, I just want to get away from them. I feel like I drive crazy, although I am self-proclaimed skilled at driving....though definitely still a crazy and I shouldn't be on the road, driver.........And for the mall, I noticed that I'm this confident-soul walking around the mall with my family, but the moment I'm stopped in a store, around people....I DO  NOT LIKE IT! I guess, when I'm walking I can just pretend I never heard anyone try to speak to me, where in the store I'm really just stuck to, having to bolt out or just for the person to go away on their own. I wouldn't speak to anyone in front of my family; if I'm alone...there's a better ability to speak to a random person, but not really a greater chance that I would speak to them. If I did, it'll be the minimum, until they go away.\n\nI re-imagine that night where that girl approached my car; if it was just me. How does that go? I really don't know. It probably would've gone like it did, the one time I was ordering food (when I was at the mall with my friends)....she probably wouldn't of heard me. I would probably just do as much as I could to get her to go away, but idk....and I don't mean to dwell on what could of been, but I don't really imagine much past the minute.....besides these papers I gotta write, and the potential I may get back into Xbox. I really wanna play COD again, I miss that. Idk, I think even before my family said anything like my mind was there, I liked that girl........I just-   .....anything beyond that is impossible.\n\nIdk there's always more to write, but I just wrote probably 3k words. The most motive I have these days is to just keep track of where I'm at...of something; what, idk? Back when in July, I did it to sort of update everyone....I thought I was Jesus, out here, just trying to do it for my followers or some shit....I kind of wanted to not only speak for the potential of a future with that girl (THAT, that is why. I saw a FUTURE then....that I never pictured before). I lost that, I no longer picture the future, or a future. I'm just going to work on this 5th custom album to put together based on unreleased Juice WRLD songs, I call this one DOOM (based on the song, and the word for the other songs)....just need to get the higher quality mp3s....and yeah.\n\nI wish someone would've known sooner or helped me sooner, because now I don't care. Not enough. And I was astonished at a guy not wanting to change on here, back in July, when I did wanna change...and now I'm that guy. This was just writing everything down, I kind of condensed near the end but.....yeah. Idk. I keep this in a LOG too, I'll copy/paste it there. And I just went through it, to idk fix things? yeah....the next part is awkward, and skeevs me out, but....it, is.\n\n**OCD (spoilered cause it's kind of 18+, kind of weird too, not gonna lie....and it's not the right place really to talk about it, but idk):**\n\nAnd I also have extreme contamination OCD &gt;!of bathrooms, mainly just bathrooms for this part, I have to shower after pooping, every time........and sex (not that I've ever had it), it just grosses me out, and it grosses me out when people talk too openly about it; jokingly, and I'm fine with that, I do that....but otherwise no. Even if I do overcome talking I have to somehow overcome that, and that only adds to my problems....idk how I have a relationship, I'm not sex-repulsed or Asexual, I just am very grossed out by the bodily fluids and all that, pee not as much because I've learned that's sterile....but it still smells and is gross, but it's more tolerable than anything else, I don't like to get too specific, more than I need to....these two problems have been for years (since about 2015, I'm 12-13 then)......it's a very relevant problem, but I really keep the 'sex one' to myself. In the past I used to be fine with both such things and I was gross, like I did not care....but there was a time when I stopped masturbating (makes me uncomfortable to say that word here or anywhere really, but yeah) for about 9 months .  I got exposed over Instagram with my face for liking pictures of instagram models.....in that Activity section, I had no clue about.....and then later after those 9 months, in school (8th grade) apparently rumors spread I, \"jerk off to porn...\" Which now I wouldn't care, but I think the disconnect screwed me, those 9 months, of becoming afraid of bodily fluids.....and I hate to talk about this, like this because it's weird and creepy, but it's how I think it came to be. Ever since then it's always been such rough waters for me, and I can never, get over the lack of cleanliness of that all.....I don't understand how people are fine with it all. Pooping, ok....I just find the toilets gross and idk how you actually mange to clean anything effectively....that's not as big as an issue in my book though; it's tolerable, just annoying. Although my showers do take about an hour, because I just have to be so thorough (I am cleaning the entire time, nothing else). And I hate to just throw this here, but with that, that's the extent of all my issues, again there's always more to talk about, but that's it.  And it's crazy because as a kid....I did not care about washing my hands after I peed, and my parents just wiped my butt then so I never had to worry about washing my hands. !&lt;\n\nI feel like my SM or Contamination OCD wouldn't be as severe if the other one didn't exist. And they're sort of the same, I feel like I can dive off the deep end of either problem and solve it in a day....but then it's committing to the life where I am no longer protected from either of my own anxieties, I'm just forced to live with them. And if I did, I just don't understand how to deal with either.

It's important to mention because it may have an influence on what I'm going to talk about.\u00a0\n\nI just wanted to hear about others' experiences after overcoming SM and SA. How did you adapt and how did you learn \"how to be\" in society ? Since I've spent years and years being mute I'm completely lost about social things because I didn't learn how to behave at school. I find myself to be completely lost, even more because I have made friends with my parents and it's completely different then being friends with people your age. They tease each other, they make some specific jokes, they seem to have a persona and I don't know if I'm overthinking all this, which causes me to be lost, or if I'm really late about all this and have to learn. That's probably both. I personally fear crossing the line when making jokes, making it too long or bringing it too far when people already changed topics or are completely unrelated and people don't relate to it because it's not something to say or not in this context or not at the moment.\n\nNot to say that I'm also very sensitive so I don't really like teasing but teenagers do that all the time so even jokes about me can hurt me but I don't show it. And since I'm highly sensitive I'm also very empathic and don't want to joke about others in fear of \"crossing the line\" (not knowing when it might become inappropriate) or hurting them but I've noticed that I put myself in others shoes a lot (is this even a bad thing?) but others don't do as much.\n\nThe thing is I'm really confused about if this is a real problem or if I overthink because of SA.\n\nBefore there are comments about that I want to say that I don't have ASD which could cause me to be lost w social cues and non verbal and I don't think I have autistic traits.\n\nBut that's just my story. I'd like to hear others' experiences about their feelings after they overcame SM, if they felt and if so how did it get better/how did you improve your social skills. Because I don't see anyone talking about the difficulties after they overcome SM they usually just talk about the experiences they had before but not after which makes me question too (Was it really a problem then if they don't talk about it ?)\n\nI also see a lot of people saying that you just have to be yourself but how can you be yourself when you don't have \"a self\" for social things. There's no thing such as being yourself, you don't have a stable \"self\" you're just malleable to some extent so you can adapt to situations and I didn't learn how to behave in this situation so I can't really \"be myself\". That's my problem.\n\nIn summary, I want your opinion on my story and also your own experiences about this if you have some.\n\nSorry if there's some mistakes, I'm not native and thanks for your answers in advance !", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5808, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "After Selective Mutism ?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/r20xnw/after_selective_mutism/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Trustnoboody", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "0ab735ee-8171-11e9-8a25-0ef95564d0f4", "author_flair_text": "Diagnosed SM", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_c7dunz3j", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1637802908, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/r1k9y3/just_stuff/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r1k9y3", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "389d6cec-937f-11e9-9d30-0e6c3cf3f1f6", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/r1k9y3/just_stuff/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1637802919, "score": 1, "selftext": " *\\*I put this on the Discord, but I wanna put it here too.*\n\nMom says I act like a baby.

I'm currently in college and needed to take a public speaking class, dropped it several times, and finally decided to go through with it this semester.\n\n...and I did it! \n\nMy first speech...felt like I bombed it. My voice was shaky, I made like zero eye contact with the audience, etc. Felt like the worst delivery in the class.\n\nBut I didn't dwell on that because I was so relieved it was over and proud that I did it. The second and third speeches went way better. Thanks to the teacher offering some extra credit, I've somehow managed an A. My past self literally never would have believed I could do it.\n\nThe fact that we have to wear masks helped me (though I was also nervous about being loud enough) because I feel better having half my face covered lmao. Most people also took the option to present their speeches through Zoom, so I only had to deliver the last speech to 3 people in person. That was sweet. Personally, I have a fear of/aversion to recording my voice, so I actually prefer talking in person. \n\nSo if anyone has to do something similar, maybe this can give some hope. As a kid, I only talked to four people. Now I can complete my degree by the end of this year because I pushed myself to do something so daunting and uncomfortable.

The first stage is to research what is the treatment of choice for your child\u2019s difficulty.\u00a0 In the case of a child with SM and other anxiety disorders, current research points to cognitive behavior therapy as usually being the most effective treatment. Then consider the proximity of therapists, what their areas of expertise are, and ensure that they have ample experience in treating SM. Ask friends and acquaintances for recommendations, and you can also join relevant chat groups to consider others\u2019 experiences with a therapist for SM.\n\nOnce you have set up an appointment with a therapist, make sure that initially, you are interviewing her, and not the converse. Evaluate what her outlook is and which methods she employs. Is contact with the school staff and parents an integral part of her treatment? You might check where she studied and trained. Find out how much experience she has, and how successful her treatments were. You could find out what her estimation of the duration of the therapy will be. Ask her for references so that you could talk to parents whose children she has treated, and consider their recommendations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#selectivemutism #therapists #parents #children #kids r/selectivemutism", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5791, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "\"Shopping\" for a Therapist", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/r08ziw/shopping_for_a_therapist/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Bunny_Senpia", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_d2o3ua21", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1637636116, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/r033ov/vent_about_random_life/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r033ov", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "389d6cec-937f-11e9-9d30-0e6c3cf3f1f6", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/r033ov/vent_about_random_life/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1637636127, "score": 1, "selftext": "I cant talk to people like at all.

However, it also affected my vocals a lot and caused my voice to get, in my opinion, a lot more ugly and harder for me to talk louder, and in addition to my puberphonia(female(yes girls can have it, it's just not talked about since it's okay to have a high pitch voice as a girl)) it's not a really good combination. Therefore, I now got bullied for two things regarding my voice, which made me become a selective mute for several years.\n\nDue to this, my vocals never got to the point of recovery and nowadays I still usually only communicate via voice if really needed or talk to others by using my phone or notes. I use social games like VRChat to compensate for my non-existent social life, although I am not very successful in there as well because I even get bullied there. People tell me how unpleasant and weird my voice is and how they get uncomfortable by me talking to them and that I sound like some horror movie child. Some also fetishise my voice really bad, but I don't want to talk about that at all. IRL I also get told the same, but in addition, I also get bullied because of my race, since I live in a majorly White country.\n\nI am really eager to talk to people. I wish I could talk to everybody and try to be friends with them, but society still blocks me off and I get more demotivated as the days pass and struggle with the ever-growing thought of just being quiet again. That is why I am afraid that I will get relapsed back into selective mutism. My parents neither aren't a big help, because they might be nice to me but they barely have any time for me since they're hard-working. Oh, and yeah, I do know that there are people that aren't bullies, but it's also still hard to get to those because 95% of the time they don't understand me. They just give up on me because of that, nodding their heads even though they don't even know what I've said.\n\nThe thing I need help with is to find out how I can fix my vocal issues. I know, it sounds pretty easy to solve and I've already got told by several doctors and therapists that I should just go and talk to people, but it's not as easy if people do not want to talk to you. I've also done things like vocal stages and talking to myself, but it's just depressing because it feels like I'm getting pressed into my face how people don't want to talk to me and nobody wants to do them with me neither, which makes me feel terribly lonely. I also really would like to know if somebody with the same issue even exists, because I have never seen another person with the same vocal struggles as I have. \n\nI really hope one of you guys can help me and thanks for reading this far! I also apologise if some of my wording or my grammar might be confusing and I hope that I've understandably worded everything.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5790, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My aftermaths and forced relapsation of selective mutism.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/qxwc10/my_aftermaths_and_forced_relapsation_of_selective/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ErraticEngineer", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ou2nn", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1637347829, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/qxmtj2/trying_to_explain_to_a_friend/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qxmtj2", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "346468e2-937f-11e9-82f2-0eccdc050e9e", "link_flair_text": "Help", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/qxmtj2/trying_to_explain_to_a_friend/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1637347841, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI have had issues with mutism since I was young. It has evolved into more anxiety, and I have long periods where I am unable to talk in person.\n\nI have a hard time conveying this to people. They think I am just nervous so I am not talking. I tell them I am not trying to be quiet. I love playing devil's advocate and love seeing why. I always ask questions. When I get quiet it is not because I want to. It does not seem to click with some people even explaining part of it.\n\nOne problem is physical presence seems to be part of it. If my roommate is in her room and not around me, we can talk over voice chat. She shows up in my room I clam up. I have no explanation. I dislike it. I know reasons for it are varied but I cannot explain why it happens to me with that specific scenario.\n\nI do not know how to explain these things and since an event a few years ago these problems have gotten worse. I dislike the idea that people may think I am snubbing them. \nPreviously when I went quiet I would just withdraw. I do not have that capability anymore. \n\nThis is partially a rant and partially asking for help. I already know one of my roommates thinks I'm faking and it  is no fun. What do people do to properly convey it? I feel like I am missing something. My family all understood but that was fifteen years ago and I am now in my thirties.\n\nThanks.

I've been struggling all my life (27 now). In places I feel uncomfortable, I still speak with a softer voice and keep my sentences short (sometimes even stuttering). As a kid, besides being mute, I was also very passive in my movements. I'd be afraid to stand up to pick a new book in class. I always called it a curse, making me unable to speak. \n\nI remember stories of primary school teachers being embarrassed to have forgotten to take me back inside after breaks. I've learned to talk with therapy on a special school.\nOnce I left that special school, everything went downhill. I got bullied a lot. Classmates would keep overthrowing me with questions until I started crying, after which they suddenly started acting all nice. It happened a lot.\nAfter that I had to move to a place for people with autism (my mom's ex insisted I moved out, he didn't understand/hated me so I didn't feel safe at home either). Ever since, I've lived with people with autism. I never felt like I belonged there. I know I have communication problems, but I always felt different. I just couldn't talk.\nAt some point, a year or two after Pokemon Go came out, I came across a group of players in my town. I worked up the courage to ask them about the group, and joined their community. I could finally be myself and talk normally to them! For about a year I'd been the happiest I ever was, cycling around, talking to them and finding my bf.\nDue to issues where I lived, I later moved in with my bf and his parents until we found a place for ourselves. I was adjusting to living there, when covid hit and everyone stayed at home. I was always afraid to be too \"visible\" and to talk much, I stayed in my room as much as possible. So I always worried that the parents didn't like me. At the same time I'd been job hunting with a jobcoach, so once covid restrictions got lifted I got invited to some interviews. I felt like the interviews weren't going so bad, not until recently I realized I must still have seemed too \"passive\" and/or quiet to them.\n\nCurrently I'm looking for a place to live for my own again (I've moved every year the past ~5 years) and accepted a contract offer in the cafe I've been \"working\" for a few years. It's the last place I've been with assisted living. I've never felt comfortable with the assisted living places, so here too I still use my \"soft voice\". The whole reason I was looking for another job, was to separate myself from those places. Pokemon Go made me realise I actually could be able to talk normally to other people.\n\nAnd only recently, I got spammed online by the anime \"Komi can't communicate\". I had to look it up, I had to search if it's actually about SM and I watched the first episode crying. Everything is so familliar, and many bits even equal to my experiences. I remembered it's why I have trouble communicating. I can talk now, but it's still chasing me. Sometimes when I go home from work I cry from the mental exhaustion. Sometimes I have a good day and forget all about it. Sometimes I hear people talking about stuff I like and I can't join in. Sometimes I have conversations that make me happy. Sometimes I stay mute and get angry inside. After all this time I'm so scared it will still hold me back in the future.\n\nThanks to Komi, I found out about this subreddit.

I was diagnosed with selective mutism when I was around 4 or 5 (I\u2019m not exactly sure I\u2019m going off what I remember my mum telling me) and was mute for a year or so, my parents got me into speech therapy and I was offered anti-anxiety medication but that sacred my dad so we just stuck to the speech therapy. So anyway, I got better and have absolutely no memory of ever being mute or experiencing selective mutism, I have a pretty rubbish memory and don\u2019t really remember anything from being little.\n\nThat is what brings me here because I\u2019ve got into a relationship for the first time therefore completely uncharted social territory and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll clam up and not get a word out. As I have no memory of being mute I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m just completely over thinking this or if going back into not being able to get words out is even a thing? \n\nMy worry is coming for the fact that I\u2019m basically fine in all social situation like answering a phone, going up to order food, introducing my self to new people etc because they\u2019re all well practiced and I can\u2019t remember a time when that was hard for me so idk if I\u2019m just overthinking this now. And as a younger teen I\u2019d made friends with a very socially anxious group of friends so got even more practice at being the one to go up to ask for the order etc and got even more comfortable. But being in a relationship communication like flirting or expressing my feelings of attraction (like saying you\u2019re pretty) makes me fell anxious completely and as I haven\u2019t really done this before I\u2019ve got no reference on what to do or how the conversation might play out if that makes any sense. The last time I tried to get into a relationship with a friend when I noticed them flirting with me I remember just sort of smiling and nodding until they moved on idk why and I can\u2019t remember what I felt in the moment just my reaction, once again my memory is not helping me.\n\nI have noticed recently I get words in muddles and say them the wrong way around and stumble over them and sometimes stutter out a word or two in a sentence oddly but I just go through it and I don\u2019t seem to get weird looks and I correct my self quickly so I\u2019m assuming I\u2019m just doing that a normal amount?\n\nContext of this relationship if it\u2019s important. I\u2019m 18 and have gone to uni, they\u2019re a friend from home and we\u2019ve know each other for a while (please no one start telling me long distance is a bad idea I\u2019m not attracted to people that often and that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here to ask about). I\u2019d been muddling over my attraction to them for a bit but decided I was so close to uni and they were a good friend so there was no point in perusing it but then they asked me if I wanted to go on a date when I get back for the holidays. I decided screw the fact they\u2019re a long way away I don\u2019t get attracted to others that often, they\u2019re lovely, if I don\u2019t give relationships a try when they\u2019re offered I\u2019ll just stay single. So we\u2019ve been talking over text for a while now and we\u2019ll use heart emojis, kisses and pet names and things and I\u2019m worried in person I\u2019ll just clam up and not get a word out.\n\nI have told them I\u2019m worried about clamming up and not saying anything and they\u2019ve been lovey and assured me it\u2019s ok if I can\u2019t say anything and we can work out what to do about the together if it happens but the idea of them being affectionate and me just freezing makes me feel bad and then more anxious that that is in fact what\u2019ll happen.\n\nSo I guess what I\u2019m asking is for those of you who still remember having selective mutism or have it now does it sound like I\u2019ll clam up when I go home and speak to them in person or am I just feeling anxious in general and will probably be fine? Because if everyone says yah no it won\u2019t come back if you were treated as a kid and it worked your just overthinking, then I think that\u2019ll make me less anxious but if not then I\u2019ll just go with the flow.

I believe that my 4-year old has SM. He is loud and talkative in the home but in preschool and karate class l he communicates mainly by whispering or nodding his head. He has been in this preschool since Feb 2021. The teacher says that he will respond to her but it typically is a whisper only. He will answer her questions with a nod or a whisper. He seems to really struggle with gaining attention of adults in the classroom. Especially when he needs something. \n\nWhen teachers talk to him (i.e., say hello) he will look at his feet and refuse to answer. The teacher said that he is starting to talk more to his peers but not consistently. He is hyper-compliant in the school setting. In September the teacher said he was not communicating his needs/wants to teachers. So I suggested that he raise his hand to get a teachers attention (I didn't know if it was OK to do that, I just desperate to try something), and that seems to have worked a little but it's still a whisper. \n\nI was starting to get concerned so I contacted a therapist and he has an evaluation next week. My thought was that they could at least provide an assessment so we know how to help him (even if the diagnosis is not SM). \n\nHere is what is throwing me off. I told my sister about it and she is completely dismissing me. He does talk very well to her, so she doesn't see it personally. She basically told me that he just is emotionally immature and that he is just weird. She said that I am blowing it out of proportion. She said that he will be fine and that we just baby him too much which is why he is not talking. My husband is also not being supportive -- he says that my 4-year is just shy and I need to just give it time. \n\nI'm feeling lost. Should I cancel the appointment? I don't want to make it worse. I just want to support him and provide him what he needs.

I can sometimes force myself to talk to teachers or say a quick \u201cno thanks\u201d to flight attendants, fast food workers, ect. This sounds like sm to me but I also might just be shy. Is it even possible to have sm and be able to force yourself to talk to people occasionally now that I\u2019m older? I\u2019m going back to in person school in January and if this is even possible, should I bring it up with my therapist? I\u2019ve tried using google and doing research but I\u2019ll I\u2019ve found is stuff about toddlers and nothing about if it is untreated or how it actually works.

This is actually the first post that I\u2019ve made on the internet, although I\u2019ve been reading for a while. I made an account just for this post, so I hope I\u2019m doing everything correctly. I am writing out of desperation for ways to overcome selective mutism, which I have had my entire life. I am currently a 23-year-old male living in the United States.\n\nI have known that I specifically have SM since I was thirteen. Before that, I thought I was just shy or anxious. I had very little contact with people in general because I was homeschooled throughout all grades. The only socialization that I received was from going to the grocery store with my mom, but I still never had verbal contact with people as shoppers don\u2019t typically talk to each other. I have recently finished college and obtained a Bachelor\u2019s degree, but I still barely had contact with people. I was also a commuter student, so I went back home to live with my mom after each day of classes. I have never had a job and my family heavily discourages me from working.\n\nWhen I was young, I could not talk to strangers while my family was present, visible, or there would be any possibility in which my family would know what I said to the other person. If someone spoke to me when my family was watching from a distance, I would either ignore them or speak one-word answers to them out of the side of my mouth like a ventriloquist. Now, my SM has manifested and worsened to the point to where I cannot indicate feelings, desires, or show initiative in front of my family. To this day, my family has no idea that I have selective mutism and I am unable to tell them. I cannot get any treatment from a therapist because SM prevents me from showing that need.\n\nNow that I have finished college, I feel like my life is finished. Since I cannot work, live on my own, or do any activities outside of home, there\u2019s nothing left for me to do but wait until death. I literally wake up in the morning, look at memes for ten hours, and then go back to bed, all while eating copious amounts of candy. I get very sad when I think about all of the things that I have missed out on that other people are able to do so easily, as well as the things that I want to do that I will never achieve. I\u2019m at the point where I must either recover or commit suicide. As I see it, I have only two options that don\u2019t involve my death:\n\n1. Disappear in the night and move to another state. If I do this, I will certainly be homeless for a few years, but if I manage to hide myself from my family, I could have the life that I wanted, secretly. I would rather move to another country to have more distance, but I can\u2019t hide that because it requires filling out paperwork beforehand.\n\n2. Kill my family. In my state, I will probably receive a sentence of at least ten years if it\u2019s an \u201cact of passion\u201d, but after my sentence, I will have my freedom. I feel very guilty when I think of how relieved I would be if my entire family was dead. I would have more freedom in federal prison than I do right now. Definitely don\u2019t want to do this! \n\nAs you can see, I\u2019m quite desperate. I would literally rather die than talk to my family about my problem. I much prefer option one.

So whenever I was asked to explain myself\u2014 usually my feelings or emotions were rejected(?) Or disregarded when asked to explain myself.\n\nWhich was frustrating. Even as a kid.

And I\u2019ll just cry.\n\nFrom my pov, it physically hurts to explain myself. My tongue hurts, my mouth aches, it\u2019s like it fastens shut at the mere attempt at forming words.

But last night it happened again. And I couldn\u2019t speak. Just cry. Wracked with pain all over just to form zero words. Withdrawing completely.\n\n\nFor someone who is usually outgoing\u2014 these situations are extremely frustrating. I really cannot talk when asked to say how I\u2019m feeling or why I\u2019m hurting at all.\n\n\nI can\u2019t find anything anywhere on it. SM is the only thing that makes sense.

That culminated in our dad having to break down a door to get to him, which I was present for, because our parents asked me to come home to join in on the session. He hasn't spoken to me since. I've talked at him a bit to say my piece; that I'm taking a step back from being involved in his treatment, I just want to hang out with him again, and that there's no pressure either way for him to say anything. I don't know if this is the right choice.\n\nI know its not a decision he's making, and I know that SM is not a universal experience, but I would love any advice from someone with more insight. Is it wrong to withdraw from being involved in his treatment? Does it remove pressure to have a line between the stress of his treatment and our relationship, or does it distance me from him more? He used to be able to tell me about questions and concerns about his treatment, and now he doesn't tell anyone what's going on. I want to spend more time with him, but I don't want to stress him out/feel like I'm putting pressure on him. I also just have less time to spend with him now than I used to, because of how busy my work schedule is.\n\nAgain, I know SM experiences are unique to each person, but any advice would be much appreciated.

My son can be socially immature so sometimes doesn't get along with the other older rough-and-tumble types in his class, but he is silly and loving and really just wants a friend to call his own.  Well, as far as I know, the little boy has never spoken aloud to anyone at school-- not to me or the teacher or any other kid outside of family.  I volunteer in class so I could see he was very smart, silly, and sweet. My son started recently telling me that the boy whispers things to him from time to time. So we had them over to see how it might go.   \n\nWell, after about an hour of play while the mom and I chatted and sat outside, we heard the boys running and laughing inside the house, and then what do you know, the boy started talking to my son, aloud. I could tell the mom was surprised, and she said he has NEVER spoken aloud outside family, but I could also tell she didn't want to be overly reactionary- we were just getting acquainted, and I'm sure that she didn't want to make more of a deal of it than she needed to. But then as the day went on, he started taking in front of and to my daughter as well, and then in front of me too (but not directly to me). We took a walk to the park nearby, and the boy just kept on talking to my son, daughter and his sister- even in front of a few other people! \n\nIt felt miraculous, and I don't believe in that kind of thing.  I am just thankful if we had any part in it, and hope above all that this starts him on a path of gaining confidence enough to speak more.  I told the mom that I think every kid just needs a friend- just one is enough, and perhaps he's found it.  My son was so proud as well, by the way... to have a buddy, and to be the only one who the boy has ever spoken to outside of family.

That I\u2019m not gonna drop her as a friend because she has selective mutism, I\u2019m not that sort of person. Last year she even text me saying that she doesn\u2019t want to be friends with me; I read it like she didn\u2019t want to be friends with me because she has SM. When I read that, yeahh it did hurt because I read it like she doesn\u2019t deserve friends because of her SM. During last year she also blocked me on WhatsApp (I didn\u2019t know she did at the time she blocked me until I changed my number, but not changed my phone. So our old conversations I still could see and I saw her online when I got my new number, that\u2019s how I found out. It was by accident). So we started talking through her mums phone with my new number (I didn\u2019t mention anything that she blocked me on her phone, I kinda just left it) and we just talked about different things and it was nice. Since lockdown (I don\u2019t have selective mutism) I didn\u2019t know what to say to her because my life is quite boring. So I was silent for a few weeks, nothing major, I just didn\u2019t know what to talk about; then she blocked me on her mother\u2019s phone. \nI had to contact her dad (on Facebook) to tell her basically saying (not word for word, but you get the point). \n\u201cPlease don\u2019t block me. I know you have SM and autism but I\u2019m not gonna drop you as a friend because you have SM and autism. That\u2019s wrong of me to do that. You\u2019ve never broken my trust, so I\u2019m not gonna break away the friendship. The only time I will break a friendship, is by someone breaking my trust and you have never done that. I will accept any communication, you don\u2019t have to use your voice, I don\u2019t mind. Also, you are not annoying in anyway shape of form. I will accept you as you. I love you for you. Heck, my bf has ADHD and I wouldn\u2019t change anything about him. Just like you, I wouldn\u2019t change anything about you. Just please don\u2019t block me. Next time please have your family member, therapist, PA or anyone you trust come message me, that you\u2019re not doing okay and I will leave you alone until you feel better. I will be here, waiting. Just talk to me when you\u2019re ready. Absolute no rush\u201d \nThen silence, I haven\u2019t heard from her since or her dad. I know she has Pinterest (she doesn\u2019t follow me back, well she doesn\u2019t follow anyone) and I follow her on there. (I even changed my profile picture of me and her together so she won\u2019t block me on there, so she knows I still want to be friends with her. I even did the same thing to my WhatsApp profile), so if she does message me (when she\u2019s ready of course) she can tell that I don\u2019t want to break a friendship because she has SM. \n\nRight now I\u2019m terrified to even message her directly, I know she has Facebook, Pinterest and of course WhatsApp. But I don\u2019t want to message her because I don\u2019t want to her to become worse. My bf said, let her come to you. \nI honestly think I\u2019m the only friend she has. She has pushed everyone away, her mum told me that down the phone. I don\u2019t feel bad, I just don\u2019t want anyone to feel lonely because I know how it feels to have no friends. It\u2019s the main reason why I\u2019m not giving up and she hasn\u2019t broken my trust. So I\u2019m not gonna give up on her. \n\nI just feel so in the dark right now and I\u2019m worried. I don\u2019t have SM, I have been educating myself on what\u2019s it like. It\u2019s why I say \u201cI will accept any communication\u201d. I know I should said from the beginning \u2018what type of communication will you feel comfortable with?\u2019\nBut with her going none verbal 2x within months, is making my anxiety hitting the roof. \nShe\u2019s a full grown adult with server SM.

He started hanging out with our youngest brother more as I left the house to go to college and moved to the other side of the country (California).\n\nWe are now adults (I am 25 and he is 23). He lives with our single mother and youngest brother who will soon leave for college. Unfortunately he has discipline issues and often disobeys our mother and bothers her to the point of tears (spilling food, calling her names, and sometimes but rarely a forceful push). It has gotten worse and I feel like he is doing this out of a need for attention since our youngest brother has stopped hanging out with him and has socially moved on. \n\nWell we haven\u2019t talked in a while, but I do I call my mother often and every time he runs to her room and tries to listen into the conversation. I sort of feel he wants to be included and maybe he would like to participate in my conversation, but can only do it with my mother present (she is practically the only one he talks to now). \n\nI would love to build a relationship with my brother to be on speaking terms again. For starters I was thinking we could play some video games again. It was his favorite activity. I would like to engage in something that allows more conversation. He loves Star Wars and it\u2019s one of the few topics I can actually get him to talk with me about. Unfortunately I have lost touch with the series. He also likes to read sci-fi.\n\nI would love any input on how to approach this! I know I may not have the same relationship as when we\u2019re children, but I do love him and feel responsible for letting our relationship drift away. It would also make our mom really happy to see us connecting again.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 4974, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Reconnecting with adult brother who has selective mutism", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/nmmee5/reconnecting_with_adult_brother_who_has_selective/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "iStudiedTheBlade09", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3rptfxl5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1622121055, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/nm745d/breathing_to_speak/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nm745d", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/nm745d/breathing_to_speak/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1622121067, "score": 1, "selftext": "The bottom of the belly releases hormones upon expansion that tell the brain to be excessively calm.

This event has caused me so much pain and think about it constantly. \n\nBackstory: I (18F) am not diagnosed with selective mutism but I'm currently working on it with my therapist. I have struggled with speaking in certain situations all my life, these usually include speaking to teachers, people I'm not close with, etc. I never received any sort of support or help for this until I was about 15/16 when I managed to pluck up the courage to tell my mum I think I needed help. Even then I still had very little support. \n\nStory: I was about 11 years old and I was at school. We had a substitute teacher that day but I knew her, she was my old friends (who was also in this class) mum so she knew me too. We had just finished doing some simple maths equations and we were sitting down on the mat. The teacher was asking random people from the class the answers to the questions. Speaking in front of the class (especially when put on the spot like this) is something I have never been able to do. But of course the teacher picked on me. Now I had been at school for 7 years at this point so I had been picked on many times before. Usually I try my very hardest to say the answer (which I almost always know) but 99.99% of the time it never comes out and after not long teachers usually will move on. \n\nUnfortunately this teacher decided that she wasn't going to move on. She kept pushing me to say the answer (which was 36 - its been so engrained into my head and I don't think I'll ever forget it). She was not blind, so I'm sure she could see the pain on my face. Eventually the tears arrived. In situations like this I tend to freeze. I was completely still, not making eye contact and in so much pain. She eventually gave up on getting the answer but did not let me off the hook. (Keep in mind that the entire class is watching this). She made some comment about how I was being very disrespectful, rude, etc. and then told me to go wait outside in the hallway.\n\nI'm not really sure how I managed to move during this given hat I'm was completely frozen, but I did,  I got up and went out into the hallway, went to a corner and continued to cry. I'm not really sure what I was crying about - was it that I was upset with the teacher? myself? or the situation? I don't know. \n\nThe teacher finished the questions with the rest of the class. While she was doing so, a family friend (who I'm not close with but just know) who was in the year above (not in my class) me saw my crying in the hallway and asked what was wrong, of course I couldn't tell her what happened so she opened the door to my class and told the teacher that I was out here. The teacher told her to just leave me and she would sort me out once she's finished.\n\nWhen the teacher eventually came out she basically yelled at me again and lectured me about how rude and disrespectful I am. I honestly don't know why. She knew me. She knew I basically couldn't talk in that situation, but she just didn't get it. She let me back into the class but I just didn't want to be there. It was really embarrassing. I mean its embarrassing enough not being able to speak when picked on, but when the teacher basically full on humiliates me in front of the class... its hard. It was really awkward with my friends afterwards as well and I wasn't that close with them which made it harder. \n\nI always think about that day. What could I have done differently to not have ended up in that situation? What if I didn't just go out into the hallway? - the door to outside was right there, I could have gone anywhere. I tend to go to the bathrooms when I feel overwhelmed, so what if I had gone there? No one would no where I was. I would have made the situation worse but would it have been better in the long run? Surely if they couldn't find me then they would have had to call my parents or someone, therefore other people would know what happened that day. But no one knows (or at least I don't think anyone knows, if some else knows they never brought it up with me). \n\nMaybe the teacher thought she would push me into speaking when picked on. If that was her plan then it definitely didn't work. I still can't speak in those sorts of situations, it could even be worse now. All through high school teachers continued to tell me (but a lot more gently and not in front of the class) that its rude not to answer when spoken to, and so on. \n\nSorry for the long post, but it does feel nice to write this out rather than keeping it all in my head.

4 years. i suppose ideally children would get the help they need so they don\u2019t have anxiety that causes them to be mute, but that\u2019s clearly not the case for a lot of people. so why is there

I have been seeing how I feel with different forms of communication. I find in times of high anxiety (new social situations, dealing with conflict, feeling really emotional,etc), I really benefit from using written communication (which has been made possible with things being virtual) - I feel far less anxious, like actually not anxious at all, and I don't end up ruminating on the conversation as much after.   \n\n\nI see a therapist regularly. He knows I'm autistic. I have told him written communication is easier for me, especially during times of distress. I scripted a reflection for today's session because I'm going through a lot of different things and have a hard time coming up with what I want to say in the moment right now. I shared my reflection. Then, I started responding to his questions via the message feature (which I haven't done this much before, and have been hesitant to do so because I was afraid he would say something or think I'm weird). He said he noticed I was using it more and inquired about it. I started to get defensive and felt frustrated. I let him know and changed the subject. We then got to the end of the session and I asked him a follow up question from another session. Instead of answering the question, he made a comment about how I have this pattern of taking notes during session and bringing up things later. He emphasized he was just curious.   \n\n\nThis whole thing made me really mad. He has made comments about me taking notes before and I mentioned how that made me feel uncomfortable.

I use it as a coping mechanism when I shut down or go into a flashback as I also have C-PTSD. \nAt my new college where everyone is pretty loud and extroverted, people know I'm generally a quiet person, but they all treat it like it's some major downside and it's some big detriment to THEIR lives. However, because I sometimes CAN'T say very much, I can be a good listener and I can eventually come out of my mutism for a short while to make conversation. But the constant chuckles from people after I say something really gets on my nerves - the most annoying is \"wow, you actually have a voice?\" And \"I wish you would say more- you're really hard to talk to.\"\nI find that these comments make me go mute more often, but today was the worst:\nToday was a \"mute day\" for me, meaning that today was just one of the those days where I couldn't say much. To start, my friends (who know I have Selective Mutism) said to me \"you're not saying much today - liven up a bit\". Another one pointed out that he could see my stomach when I stretched. I was already mute by that point and that comment just felt so gross and irrelevant, so I couldn't retort. I'm not thin, neither am I particularly chubby, but I am sensitive about my appearance as that was one of the things I was heavily bullied for. \nLastly, my favourite teacher (who also knows I have SM) told me I'm \"very quiet back there\" and asked if I would answer a question. It felt kind of insensitive as he knows that I don't particularly like to answer questions.\nToday kinda sucked, I won't lie.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 4756, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Everyone at my college gets on my nerves, but today really sucked.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/n5hv01/everyone_at_my_college_gets_on_my_nerves_but/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HekiDaMute", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_b7i5i26b", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1620117243, "crosspost_parent": "t3_n3yj7h", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [{"award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "award_type": "global", "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "coin_price": 150, "coin_reward": 0, "count": 18, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "days_of_premium": 0, "description": "Thank you stranger.

We celebrated our 20 year friendship anniversary in 2019! [Here](https://imgur.com/a/0Rctn5m) is a picture of the two of us in 1999- the year that we met and when my story takes place. \n\n* I mention daycare and a woman named Miss Kathy in the story- I went back to the daycare at 19 to work for her over the summer and that helped tremendously with my SM recovery journey. It was the best job I ever had and instead of staying for a summer, I stayed there for three years.

i just thought i\u2019d try to explain the way i am about certain things &amp; idk i\u2019d rather go on reddit before a doctor just you know to hear what anyone has to say about what im saying about me. \ni was diagnosed with selective mutism &amp; depression when i was 10, before that doctors would say its the flu as i puked from anxiety. when i was prob 8/9 well idk when i started but ik i would put music in headphones &amp; go on my trampoline &amp; walk in circles &amp; just imagine a completely different life &amp; the storyline has changed many times considering my age now but i still do it just in my hallway at home. i get like an urge to do it like an addiction or something idk i\u2019ve never heard anyone say anything like this before i could be the only person who\u2019s ever done this. i have the absolute hardest time making friends (i love the few i have tho) in school no one would ever talk to me &amp; i could never talk to someone first so the only way i ever made friends was online, then meeting in person (or just online) when i was 16/17 im guessing (thats when guys mostly started hitting me up) then i found that i would get told im too awkward then get unadded/blocked the literal only guy who didnt immediately after meeting me was my ex but he broke up with me after almost 3 months bc he didnt know if i wanted to have sex &amp; i think bc of my anxiety &amp; that was almost 2 years ago i basically refuse to meet anyone new bc im not trying to just get dropped &amp; i cant really defend myself &amp; yes/no are extremely impossible in person i can only say idk except with my immediate family &amp; my few close friends. another thing is that i absolutely have no clue how to know my mood i used to always say good then i got hit by a truck in nov 2018 &amp; then i knew i had to be bad bc of the pain but i have no clue what good is supposed to feel like at all really. i also do things like eye contact lowkey feels like it hurts my eyes in a way but i just associated that with my anxiety. for some reason all i can ever talk about is animals, when someone in my family seems annoyed or like they don\u2019t care i tell myself i\u2019m never talking to them again &amp; the next time i talk its about animals. i cant get a job no matter how hard i try since i was 15/16, i had one last summer on a blueberry farm but it was too much standing after breaking my femur i would\u2019ve been able to do it if my leg wasn\u2019t an issue too, but idk i just thought id explain some stuff cuz it makes me confused &amp;

I have always been unable to talk to people I'm not close to. I can't even say \"hi\" to anyone, even children when I first meet them. When I was a child, people said I was shy and would grow out of it, but needless to say, I never did. After 4 years ago, I was researching on selective mutism and I realized it was just my experience, so one day when my father asked me why I can't talk, I told him it could possibly be selective mutism. When we got home later that day, he talked about it with me around my mother. She immediately said \"No, no, no, did she tell you she has selective mutism? She doesn't. Not at all.\" I was a bit confused so I asked why she was so sure. She said that \"people with selective mutism can't talk. You can.\" And I was explaining how they CAN talk, just not in certain situations. She said she knew what is was and is nothing like what I have, and that I could talk if I had tried harder, yet people with selective mutism can't. She then brought up one example that she ALWAYS brings up when I'm talking about my inability to speak in social situations. One time when I was 14, I answered a security guard's question. I burst into tears and had trouble breathing afterwards, but she always brings up the single time I spoke to someone when I was 14. I don't know how you guys feel about it, but I know people with selective mutism who have spoke to strangers way more than that. Anyway, she says that situation proves that I don't have selective mutism. I remember going through security to get on a plane with my parents. Because I couldn't talk, my dad suggested to my mom that we get some sort of badge or bracelet to show to security in case something happens and they don't know why I won't answer them. She refused the idea and said that \"She just needs to work on it, she doesn't need a badge because it isn't a problem like that. She's not disabled. \" \nI understand that she doesn't want to think I have a huge problem, and that selective mutism CAN get better, but she seems to have too much faith in me. If she just understood my problem, it could be easier for her to help me like she honestly wants to. Honestly, it can be kind of annoying the way she acts towards this.

If anyone has any advice for me after reading this story then if you can, give advice.

I don't remember exactly what I did or how I felt, the only thing I remember is that I didn't talk at nursery then.\n\nI was 4-5 years old when I started primary school, surprisingly though I actually talked freely in the first 4 years there, even when I wasn't meant to, though not with other people from other classes. The teachers and my parents noticed that I didn't talk to people who weren't in my class and just assumed I was shy. I don't remember any unique interactions for these years.\n\nI stopped talking in my own class after 4 years (when I was 9-10 years old) because the classes shuffled around, so because people from other classes were now in my class I stopped talking entirely at school, even to people who were in my original class. The next 3 years I learned to try to communicate in ways that weren't speaking, which was just nodding or shaking my head, or writing down on paper what I wanted to say. The teachers and my parents obviously noticed I wasn't talking at all now, but still assumed it was just me being shy, which was weird because literally nothing pointed to that other than me not talking. I remember my interactions with others, but everything was pretty much normal other than me not talking, I surprisingly had actual friends somehow.\n\nAfter the 2 years at the final year of primary school, I was 11-12 years old. the classes shuffled again, I was too used to not talking to turn back so easily. My interactions for this year is were still quite normal but I remember having somehow new friends, which surprisingly they were the \"cool kids\". They didn't call themselves that, they were just that kind of friend group.\n\nThen there was high school, when I was 12-13 in the first year, and 13-14 in the second year. though I'm still in only the second year I'll try to go into detail, this is the part where I need help and advice in. At the start, it took awhile for every teacher to get used to me not talking, most of them went easy on me, but some of them just acted like I could do the same thing as everyone else. I should mention that none of the teachers through all of this realized I had sm, or at the very least didn't know what to do about it. Also surprisingly I made more friends, but they didn't feel like they were actual friends, most of the time they just ignore me. Some of them even feel like they're being passive aggressive to me. There was someone who feels like an actual friend, I don't remember our interactions before high school other than we were somehow friends, and that we were still somehow friends now, they just talked to me normally and not acting weird about it. Though our interactions still aren't normal, they're better than the others.\n\nIf anyone has advice on what to do, please say it.

Another time I went to a \"psychiatrist\" who sat me down and literally just stared at me saying absolutely nothing while i was having an anxiety attack and bawling my eyes out. That was probably the moment that I developed selective mutism. First day of high school and my mom informed the school about my anxiety and sm, and the first thing they did to me was they made me take an IQ test to see if I was mentally re\\*arded. The PE teachers were blatantly rude to me, they yelled at me in my face telling me to \"speak up\". They would literally act like I was such a nuisance when i was in their presence, saying things like \"how do I even deal with her?\". I was passed around different schools because I would skip classes due to anxiety and eventually they put me into a special ed school where they treated me like I was a toddler who was mentally disabled, even though I have no learning disability (apart from add). Many even accused me of being autistic, even though Ive went to a professional and wasnt diagnosed with it after all. It was so frustrating, so humiliating to be talked down, to be treated like I was a baby, like some kind of freak.

At school, I often find myself feeling physically unable to talk - someone will say something to me, and when I go to reply, I can\u2019t speak properly, I just make a really quiet noise that\u2019s not even coherent, or 90% of the time I\u2019ll just smile/laugh politely if my name is brought up in conversation. I do find I\u2019m able to talk if needed though, such as when I\u2019m asked a question in class, or when I\u2019m talking to certain people (sometimes not even friends, there\u2019s just a few people I feel comfortable taking to, not really sure why). Of course, even when I\u2019m put in situations where I have to talk, it doesn\u2019t come without anxiety and I often find myself on the verge of a panic attack even after being asked a simple question (this is due to my social anxiety).\n\nHowever this is usually only in a classroom setting - at lunch and break times, I can sit with my friends and I can talk absolutely fine. \n\nI\u2019ll talk at home absolutely fine. Super rarely there are times I won\u2019t talk to my family, usually at dinner times when I\u2019m feeling down/anxious and I just can\u2019t bring myself to talk to them, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s more related to SM or just me feeling down.\n\nI\u2019ve heard - but this might not be right - that another effect that SM can have is restricting what you feel comfortable talking aloud about, which really resonates with me. There are lots and lots of things that I don\u2019t feel comfortable taking about aloud. I also whisper/ talk extremely quietly in public - especially at school when talking to my friends in a classroom setting.\n\nSo, like stated, I\u2019m not actually sure if I have SM, so I was looking for some advice I guess. I have done a lot of research on the topic, and sometimes I\u2019ll read something that will really resonate with me, and make me think that perhaps I do have SM - but on the other hand I feel as though perhaps my symptoms aren\u2019t quite SM and perhaps just severe social anxiety?

I carry a notebook with me everywhere that I can write in, my friends are used to it by now.\n\nI have never been professionally diagnosed. I was simply regarded as the \"shy/quiet kid\" since kindergarten. It wasn't until schools started grading me for class participation (speaking) that they took notice on that I actually NEVER spoke. I would get questioned during class, not answer and get punished over and over again. When I reached 10 years old, my elementary school made me go to the counselor because it wasn't normal behaviour. The counselor tried to make conversation and it always ended with nothing.\n\nFast forward 2 years, the same thing has been going on. (But thanks to the counselling sessions I get to skip 1-2 periods lol) The counselor decided to give a letter to my parents for me to go see a psychiatrist. I showed it to my mom and she scoffed at it, saying that I was pretending and should just speak up at school. I thought nothing of it.\n\nA year later, I found an article about selective mutism. Everything that was written perfectly describes my experience at school so I forwarded it to my mom, thinking she would finally understand me. She replied with \"Stop making things up, u're normal\". So I left it at there and decided that professional help is beyond my reach.\n\nThis brings me to where I am now, and I have in fact not gotten better. It's actually getting worse. In the PTA meetings every year, my mom would get the same feedback. \"She's (still) not speaking in class,\" etc etc. I know my mom is getting tired of it, and I am too. I feel bad. But I don't know what to do.

:D i'm not sure if others can relate but if not here's a quick explanation: i believe i've had SM since elementary school. i became terrified of talking to anyone outside of my immediate family and could never bring myself to speak no matter how much i wanted to. this wasn't often, but in grade school when i made a friend i would muster up the courage to whisper a few words if i was comfortable with them. there would be a few times where they would immediately go tell everyone else in class and soon enough my classmates would bombard me with questions and beg me to speak to them. \"but you talked to \\_\\_\\_ so you can talk to me, right?\" obviously that gave me some serious anxiety and trust issues and i eventually just stopped whispering, too! i feel like there's a lot more i want to say but my brain doesn't cooperate very well with putting thoughts into words! i hope i made sense at least :) thanks for reading!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvat74svg8r61.png?width=3500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=930c2f6cc063e6e7c5151ca2a63e6521600771e4", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 4614, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/v1MW4iQqk2uS8_pu9zpbGrmZefRT0tuh2y-1g-FUgFU.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "vent art!

I\u2019m currently 19 years old and had, admittedly, self-diagnosed SM as a child. Please do comment if I was wrong.\n\nBackground:\nI didn\u2019t have the ideal home life. My family, being the typical Asian family, didn\u2019t care too much about the effects of their words on a child. I had learned very early about what kind of existence I was to them at that time.\n\nI\u2019ve suffered from depression since I was 11. Whenever I spoke at home, it usually received a bad response. The trauma made me develop a fear for speaking to my family, which later grew into selective mutism.\n\nHow it felt:\nA lock without a key, Even if I wanted to speak, massive waves of fear and anxiety would drown me. My hands would get sweaty, suddenly the words I wanted to say would get jumbled up in my head. \n\nEven if I try to speak, my throat would feel paralyzed and all I can manage are raspy staccato of the first syllable. \n\nIf I HAD to speak, I would practice over and over again. Not that it helped any.\n\nNow:\nI can speak to my family now. I still do practice in my head over and over again. My voice is still locked but I have the key now. \n\nI only speak in short sentences because speaking for longer still gives me anxiety and panic. I also cannot deal with sudden conversation. \n\nI\u2019m about 30% there, but I\u2019m doing my best everyday.\n\nSide effects:\nI never had selective mutism with my friends. However because I spent my childhood years being silent/keeping my face expressionless, I sometimes have a hard time talking to my friends.\n\nStuttering, stumbling over words, jumbling up my sentences, the occasional wave of anxiety. I feel it outside of my family.\n\nI am sensitive to it and it upsets me greatly whenever it happens.\n\nBut, I\u2019m slowly getting better.

I'm so fortunate to be surrounded by people who really love me and want to help me break out of the cycle I've been stuck in, but I'm totally locked inside myself.\n\nA friend of mine sat me down a few days ago and tried to get me to talk to him about what was going on. I was TOTALLY unable to look at him, let alone look him in the eyes. I could basically only speak half-words...I couldn't get anything out. I'd start trying to say something, but it was like I was totally empty and everything was locked up. \n\nA few hours later I was having easy conversation with him and several other people- laughing, joking around, really enjoying the conversation. \n\nSo my problem isn't location/person-specific. Surface-level conversation about myself is difficult/uncomfortable, but I TOTALLY shut down if it starts getting deeper.\n\nI had a lot of negative experiences with trying to explain myself when I was younger- people just didn't understand what was going on with me and a lot of times I was \"punished\" for my bipolar disorder (before we knew what was going on)...so I can understand why this would've started- I always felt a lot of pressure to fake it/pretend everything was fine, but I also know that the person I've mentioned in this post is totally supportive and loves me unconditionally, so I should be able to open up.\n\n\nI'm not looking for a diagnosis- I'm just trying to figure out how I can stop shutting down in conversations, because otherwise I feel like there's basically no hope of me ever getting healthy.

I've been the one writing literally thousands of messages while the others speak. Now a while ago my friend managed to help me say a word. One word. Then it slowly progressed into a bit more words, then even more words. Then even a short short sentence or two. But this has been very spread out, since some days it feels absolutely impossible to speak, and some days it feels a lot easier. So it could take weeks before I would speak again, since it also depends on the situation a lot. I have to be completely alone to speak, otherwise it's just t oo hard at the moment. My family memebers can't be near when I'm doing social practice, it just makes it a lot harder. And I have chronic fatigue which makes me extremely tired physically, which makes speaking very very difficult, since when I'm tired I also depersonalize and derealize, which ALSO makes speaking more difficult(for most people who experience  this even). So it's still VERY difficult, but sometimes I can speak. And the situations where I can speak are getting more and more, a few days ago I even said a few words when my brother was in the room besides mine. I feel like, a lot of things make it more difficult. Distractions. But my friends don't seem to get that, they're just calling it bad excuses basically, and that I should just ignore everything and close my eyes and speak. Because apparently it's easy, I just have to open my mouth and do noises. I'm just being ridiculous apparently. I'm making it harder for myself apparently. When I say speaking is difficult today because I'm very very nauseous and tired because of the medicine I take, they just say it's bad excuses and I should stop making it harder for myself. But I try to identify what makes it harder and push it away, and aknowledge it so I know why it is harder this time. But apparently it's just bad excuses and I should just not talk about things that affects it according to my friends. One of them even had SM but I feel like he lost perspective, he keeps saying it's easy and I could just speak now if I want to enough. My friends just say I'm not trying and I don't want to enough basically. Hearing this all day has made me seriously doubt myself, maybe I don't know myself as much I thought... I thought maybe speaking where I feel more comfortable would give me a better experience, since it's actually really fun then, and more doable, and expands the situations where I can speak gradually. Now I just feel not motivated at all anymore, since apparently everything is just excuses and apparently I'm doing too slow progress and apparently it's just as easy to speak when on methotrexate, I'm just lying to myself or something or whatever they're saying.

I had friends that I played with and all of my classmates knew me and didn't ever even question my \"differences\", they just accepted me the way I was. Although I have fond memories now, I can also remember times when I was so anxious I felt like passing out or I couldn't stop shivering.

For the past 13 years, I have had the freedom to say what I want to say when I want to say it, and I try to appreciate that every day. This is mainly for parents whose children are struggling to talk, but I hope it will also be uplifting to teenagers and adults who are struggling. This is what it feels like to be unable to speak.\n\nI don't know when it started, but kindergarten was the definite beginning of it being a problem. I did not say a single word at school from kindergarten until high school. In kindergarten it was not a major problem. I did not want to talk and was able to maintain friendships despite being a non-talker. Bathroom breaks were scheduled regularly, and I was not unhappy. Around 1st grade, it became apparent to the teachers that I had a problem. I was sent to therapy at school, which did not help. \n\nAs I got older it became increasingly difficult to function, both logistically and emotionally. I could not raise my hand and ask to use the restroom or ask to go to the clinic if I was sick. I could not order food from the lunchline, so I had to bring my own lunch every day. In 3rd grade, the teacher tried to bribe me into speaking, saying that there would be a party if I would start talking. This ruse did not work of course. My circle of friends began to thin out, and I felt near-constant anxiety at school. \n\nIn 4th grade, I was sent to a therapy session with some of my classmates who were deemed to be in my circle of friends. We played a board game, and they seemed to have a good time. Then when we returned to class we were told that we would have extra homework because we missed the class. My \"friends\" said they would not have wanted to go to the therapy session if they had known this in advance. I realized at that point that my circle of friends had shrunk to a dot: me. I spent recess alone and was not invited to sleepovers. I felt isolated.\n\nBy this time, I wanted to talk. It seemed I had a dug a hole so deep that it was impossible to get out. How could I just start talking, when nobody has heard my voice for so many years? It seemed an insurmountable task. I feared the reaction of my classmates. On the other hand, I reprimanded myself frequently. After all, all I had to do was start talking. My problem seemed so trivial and I felt so alone and embarrassed. In public settings outside of school, where I was able to talk, I feared that one of my classmates might happen to be there without me seeing them and would hear me talking. That would be the end of me. I had to maintain constant vigilance of everybody around me. The only place I felt safe was at home.\n\nIn 4th grade there was an oral presentation assignment. Of course I refused to do a presentation. It was decided that my parents should film my presentation at home. I refused until I felt I had no choice, and read my script as quietly as possible. I was later told that the video had been shown to the teachers and they were surprised to see me talking. When I received this news it felt as though I would be unable to continue functioning. I had worked so hard to maintain a distinction between those who can hear me talk and those who cannot, and now everything had collapsed. I lost trust in my parents for putting me through that, leading to further isolation. I think it is cruel to videotape kids at home and share the video without their consent, especially now that we have YouTube and the like.\n\nThough I didn't think it could get worse, I turned out to be wrong. In middle school I had several teachers. Each new class brought with it fresh trepidation. I dreaded the roll call and the long silence that followed when my name was called and I didn't answer. There was often confusion and awkwardness when the teacher attempted to converse with me. I was sent to therapists and psychologists outside of school as well. I was bribed with gifts of all sorts. After all the years, talking at school became a physical impossibility. One day I was injured on the basketball court and was bleeding substantially, yet I didn't say a word.\n\nAs high school approached, I thought maybe just maybe there is a chance I can make a fresh start. I was ready to start talking, in the right circumstances (i.e., with brand-new classmates). I had gone to Catholic middle school and knew most of my classmates would be going to the Catholic high school. I asked my parents if I could go to the public school, which would be full of new people. It was decided I would continue at the Catholic school. Regardless, I resolved to make a change. On the first day of my freshman year, I summoned the courage to say \"here\" when my name was called at my first class. This elicited gasps, quiet exclamations of astonishment, and raised eyebrows from my classmates who knew of my condition. I felt petrified, as though I could pass out. I wanted to melt into the ground. I wasn't able to say another word that year. \n\nI was sent to the school therapist, who was not friendly. She had me fill out a questionnaire, asking about my emotional state. I lied on every question, and she apparently wasn't fooled. She accused me of lying and had me fill it out again. The results were sent to my parents, who until this point had essentially ignored my problem. The results apparently said I was severely depressed and wanted to die. My mom confronted me about it angrily and said she didn't know what to do with me. I was ashamed and felt like a complete failure. This was the lowest point of my life.\n\nThe following year I summoned the courage again on my first day, was met with the same response of gasps and astonishment, and was not able to say another word that year. I started to fear the future: potential inability to be employed, increased burden on my parents for having no financial independence, loneliness forever. I was 16, and I decided not to go back to high school. Fortunately, there was a university in the city where I grew up. I started college, riding my bike there. I worried about not being able to talk, after all the years of silence, though fortunately I had no trouble. I made a few friends even. The \"fresh start\" had worked, and I felt liberated.\n\nIn my senior year of college, when I was 20, I enrolled in a French class to fulfill the foreign-language requirement. On my first day I realized that one of my former classmates from high school, who knew of my speaking troubles, was in that class as well. I experienced some anxiety but was able to speak. Surprisingly, he did not gasp when I spoke. I realized that it was because nobody else knew about me. If he had gasped, he would have looked like the crazy one, not me.\n\nI went on to graduate school, even giving presentations at conferences. I am entirely independent financially, and it might seem as though I have been \"cured\" completely, though this is far from true. I feel like I have accomplished a lot being able to overcome it, but at the same time I feel that I could have been much better if I hadn't been a non-talker for those eleven years. I still have the blank expression, rigid stance, and near-constant anxiety around people. I find it hard to initiate a conversation, and my trouble being personable at job interviews has undoubtedly cost me some good opportunities. I have trouble sleeping and have regular nightmares with a recurrent theme: my classmates have heard me talk. The worst part? I am depressed. It was certainly obvious to me in high school, but for the past 13 years I have been ignoring it. It is difficult to start going to a therapist when you went to them involuntarily for so many years, but I believe it has helped being able to talk about my past, hopefully without being judged. I am making progress healing from this.\n\nTo sum up, if you or your child is struggling with this, consider looking for a way to make a fresh start. If I had had the opportunity to go to a new school in 4th grade, I believe I would have been able to overcome it. The extra years of being silent have undoubtedly contributed the negative effects that I am still trying to overcome, as a 30 year old. If a fresh start isn't possible at this point in your life, I hope this story will help you to stay positive that it will get it better at some point in the future. I am living the best years of my life right now.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 207, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Eleven Years as a Non-talker", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/8w58iw/eleven_years_as_a_nontalker/"}, {"author": "Ramsey23", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1529943086, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/8trqzl/5_year_old_daughter_suffers_from_sm_considering/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8trqzl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/8trqzl/5_year_old_daughter_suffers_from_sm_considering/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1529943087, "rte_mode": "richtext", "score": 4, "selftext": "My 5 and a half year old daughter suffers from Selective Mutism.

She's going to start kindergarten soon and we really want to get help for her so that she'll get some relief.\n\nShe has seen a therapist regularly for the past year, but she has not made any progress. The therapist suggested that we consider pharmacological treatment since she hasn't been able to help much. We met with a psychiatrist who prescribed a very low dose of Zoloft. The idea of treating her this way would have seemed crazy to me a year ago, but at this point, I just want to do anything I can to help her. I don't want her starting kindergarten wearing diapers because she's too afraid to ask to go to the bathroom. I want  to wash away some of the debilitating anxiety she feels in social situations so that she can be her real self. In private, I see a funny, loud, and sweet child. In school and public settings, I see a child constantly paralyzed with fear. I feel like the longer she's the \"kid who doesn't talk\", the harder it will be to overcome.\n\nTLDR; For parents, what are your thoughts on treating SM with drugs?

Up until somewhere in yr7 I could speak to people at school without y'know feeling as if I couldn't physically speak to them. There is nothing physically stopping me from speaking but whenever I try to like when I get asked a question in a lesson it feels as if I can't like, I have no voice. \n\nI don't really have any friends, and my social skills are just fucking poor. The people that I really only talk to is my family. \n\nI don't really understand why I'm like this or why I can't speak to people. A few teachers at school (I'm currently in yr10) have tried to get me to speak to them because y'know they're worried about me because my mum mentioned that I get real pissed super easily. \n\nI've never in my life met someone who understands how I feel and I hate myself for being like this. People at school misunderstand it as being real shy or just putting me off as the quiet kid y'know. I hate being alone, I'm fed up of doing 3x the work in group assessments because I have to do it alone or it'll be real fucking awkward for the both of us.\n\nAnyway, I'm glad I could get this out y'know this shit has been brewin for a bit.\n\nHope y'all have a good day/night :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3893, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I didn't really know where else to go with this.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/jqm5di/i_didnt_really_know_where_else_to_go_with_this/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "s1cometomall", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5i1hshly", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1604862814, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/jqhif0/feel_like_someone_with_sm_would_understand_me/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jqhif0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "346468e2-937f-11e9-82f2-0eccdc050e9e", "link_flair_text": "Help", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/jqhif0/feel_like_someone_with_sm_would_understand_me/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1604862825, "score": 1, "selftext": "ive always questioned asexual &amp; aromantic but more clearly asexual. ive just always felt weird abt sex &amp; could never see myself in that way with someone else but at the same time i never knew if it was my anxiety or not it just feels weird to me yes im a virgin &amp; yes i do get horny lol but only to do it myself??

I distinctly remember feeling incredibly shy and uncomfortable around adults I didn't know well and I would never speak to them only look to my parents and maybe smile or nod. (TW) when I got to my teenage years I suffered with depression attempted suicide a couple times and was self harming and even though I had many friends at school and clubs I went a year without telling a single soul and another year before telling an adult about it. I had counselling at 14 and it took me 3 sessions before I actually told her anything other than small talk. I've always had immense trouble talking about any problems I have whether it be mental health or just that I made a small mistake, I even have a trouble just telling people that I'm having a bad day which causes me to just lash out at them and this has been causing me current issues with my job and relationship. I think the biggest issue that I have is when I need to talk to people about an emotional problem or something like an argument I just cant think of anything to say. it feels like my throat has closed up and I genuinely cant think of how to put my thoughts and feelings into words and even if I do know the answer and what I want to say there's so much anxiety that's built up to the point where I cant force myself to just. say. it. this greatly frustrates my boyfriend of 6 years he really just doesn't understand it and we've had times when I'm obviously upset about something and he sits down to ask me what's wrong and I start crying but I cant tell him and we're just sat there in silence while he waits for me to say something and I'm just there trying think of something to tell him. do you ever panic when you cant find the right amount of change and you know you have it but you can quite find it and you have the cashier waiting and maybe a couple people behind you and the more time it takes the more stressed you get making it harder for you to find what you're looking for? that's what it feels like. its not that I don't want to say it or I'm scared to say it (well sometimes I am scared because then you have to deal with the reaction from the other person) I just cant. really I just want to know if anyone on here has experienced a similar thing and if i can actually have a name to put to it. I read another post where someone said it was like going blank and i really feel that. apologies that this is so long and basically a life story.

Sure enough that kept happening. The others seemed to be able to have stuff to say, even if it was lame, but for me, I kept going blank. I was a familiar feeling, but I kept pushing through it anyway throughout the night.\n\nEven at the end I refused to go on stage kind of defiantly, against the social pressure of the group.

I was quiet in class and I remember not being good in speaking English, which I knew contributed to my inability to speak up. I was scared of being judged by my teachers or classmates. I was scared of being embarrassed. When I grew up, it became more manageable. I would still feel nervous (hands very cold), and I would often pop a candy into my mouth before a presentation, but I was able to deliver/do the task at hand. I experienced working in a toxic environment where some people had bullying tendencies. They would say things that were meant for me to overhear and I felt attacked. I was doing well at work initially but I started feeling overly stressed that I started losing my appetite and I could no longer speak without popping a candy into my mouth. I felt judged every time I spoke up or tried to excel. I left the company due to stress and found myself working in a company with kinder people. However, my condition has only gotten worse. I can\u2019t talk to people without candy in my mouth and it has been frustrating. I have avoided social interactions because of it, and I can\u2019t seem to find a way to manage it. I feel depressed and I could no longer function normally. I personally do not know anyone who has a similar experience. Any help or advice on coping would be appreciated.

We recently got a puppy and the puppy usually doesn\u2019t play with her and plays with the adults the most. The puppy started to follow her around the house and she turned around and pointed at the dog and powerfully yelled \u201cno! You didn\u2019t want to play before so now you don\u2019t get to follow me around now!\u201d. Which is unlike her. She seemed to feel guilty but pouty and very hurt despite seeming to know her reaction was wrong. She is very sensitive. Her brother teasing her leaves her standing there silent, shocked, and offended. She had a plastic doll and somehow tripped and ended up bleeding lightly from her lips from the doll. She pouted and demanded that we throw the doll out right away and than later made us get the doll back. She seems to have a strong natural sense of morals and empathy for others but her pouty reactions are a little resentful. She seems to doubt herself- mentions being bad at multiple school related topics randomly and in a sad tone. She gets along with her brother well- she\u2019s always willing to play his \u201cimaginary Pok\u00e9mon\u201d game and I know that when he gets in trouble or sent to his room, he always asks her to sneak him food and she always does. She never asks the same thing in return from him and mentioned being afraid he would react meanly and judge her because she felt guilty and wrong for her actions that got her in trouble -and so she felt like if she asked him he would react cruel due to her actions that got her in trouble. \n\nWhen we went out to eat and the waiter asks for her order, she speaks so quietly that no one can hear her and you have to read her lips. She does take things literally but I think all kids do right? She thought that someone being fired literally meant fire being thrown on them. She is a huge fan of princesses and once wore the same beauty and the beast tshirt for a month.\n\n- I know a lot of sources online say adhd a lot of special interests that change constantly while autism has long term special interests. The confusing thing is she had an interest in \u201cItaly\u201d for months- I got her a book on it and she wanted to learn the language and I think she wants to be Italian. It lasted months but she never actually put any thought or care into it or payed attention to the interest. \n\n she played imaginary games and enjoys playing \u201cbaby\u201d and laying in my lap and having me play the mom. But I\u2019ve seen her drawing on a whiteboard and she is very clearly playing pretend teacher- but if I ask if she is playing teacher she will respond \u201cno\u201d. She\u2019s done this before with other things and can be private. \n\nI think She has a fear of judgement or something and that is why she\u2019s too scared to talk to her brother when she\u2019s in trouble. I think she didn\u2019t like when things aren\u2019t peaceful and doesn\u2019t want to see someone react upset to her. I\u2019m looking into selective mutism possible but it could be challenging to differentiate if she has autism on top do that or something else.

He does not leave the room he is staying in unless to clear his system and at times when forced to get up and take a shower.  His only form of interaction is through gestures to signature a desire to eat when signaling my father who is trying to support him, my mother who visits him just sits there trying connect with him in the state he is in.  He barely watches any television unless turned on for him by my father who must then leave and go to work.  Aunts and uncles have tired to communicate with him but to no avail.  He has both me and our sister but she and her husband are also a trigger for him where he becomes agitated he has not acted out any physical confrontation but rather just the mere mention of either of their names will send him into a state where he blockades the bedroom door or locks himself on the bathroom for extended periods of time.  I\u2019m aware he previously took medication to help with depression, attended therapy with a licensed physician.  This case I couldn\u2019t compare to most of the readings I was finding with selective mutism since it was in childhood that it was seen or noticed I wasn\u2019t apart of that time line but from stories and photographs it did not appear that he was suffering from anything that was left undiscovered at the time.  He was very active from what I vaguely recall from my earliest memories of him but I was around 4-5 while he was 15-16.  He is 35 now underwent therapy at 33 which seemed to help during that first year but he did shows signs of being emotionally distant, yet I ignored it and focused on my own personal agenda.  I truly want to find the right steps to guide my family in hopes of helping him while he can\u2019t help himself both my parents are getting up in their years, I can not financially support him if they are gone and he\u2019s still found to be in this state.  He refuses to leave the room to attend sessions with physicians, I see as a sign of not wanting to help himself and refuses medication prescribed for him.

mutism and my relationship to it.\n\nAs far as I remembered, my biggest problems with SM were in the last year of school, where I didn't talk or managed to draw the teacher's attention to anything and depended on the person sitting next to me to speak for me.\n\nBut earlier today, I was thinking about it and I noticed a pattern.\n\nI remember that when I was younger, at school, in one way or another, I found a way to be alone. I would go to the place furthest from the mess and stay there. Sometimes I had company with two friends, but never more than that.\n\nIt's funny, because looking back, I was a very talkative person. But only with two people. Never more than two people at the same time. I spoke to other people, of course, but I always managed to isolate myself from the rest of the class. It was as if I chose two people and stayed with them, so when they missed class, I chose someone at random to spend the day or just be alone.\n\nI was more participative with the children on my street, but we lived on the same street, whether it was them or nothing.\n\nI also remember that when adults introduced me to someone, I couldn't speak. I was withdrawn, I thought that was shame and shyness, but maybe that was the SM.\n\nI also played a lot alone, I could spend hours playing only with my toys without having to talk to anyone else.\n\nHonestly, I don't know if I always had SM or if it came later, along with the other psychological problems.\n\nSo, I was thoughtful and I came here. My childhood memories are not the most reliable, I suck at dates and years and time in general.\n\nRepeating the question in the title, is it possible to develop SM late? Or have it mild in childhood and then worse in adulthood?

My biggest problem is strangers and just going in public. I learned a few things in ASL to say things like 'thank you', 'yes/no', and 'I am mute'. I also have a medical alert ID that says I am a SM (I have CPTSD and can have severe physical symptoms so the ID isn't strictly for being a SM).\n\nI noticed that the few times I use sign (usually to tell employees and strangers that I can't talk) people are either really nice or look at me like I'm a freak. It's kinda made me not even want to learn fluent sign because so many people don't understand. I find myself making stuff up or just using a notepad app on my phone if I really have to. \n\nMy last experience with sign was pretty bad. For context, I have a service dog that usually stays home with me because I'm a shut in but he is trained for public access so I took him to a grocery store with me. I was mute at the time because it was just a bad day and that was another reason I took my boy. I ended up getting cornered by three employees (all in there late 40s to 50s) trying to coo over my dog. One even had one of those big floor wax machines and it startled my boy so I tried to keep my distance. \n\nI signed at the trio that I was a mute (my SD has a vest patch for SM too and I pointed it out) but they rolled their eyes and kept asking my questions. I ended up bailing because my dog was starting to get a bit antsy and blocking them from me since it was stressing me out. I heard them complain a bit about me as I walked away. Basically that I was rude or faking and they even mentioned my looks. Now I'm an alternative looking guy with a SD, so at a glance I am kinda a bold appearance in my town. But it seems to just make it harder to sign because everyone expects this rock/metal looking guy to just say anything on his mind. \n\nSorry if this is long winded, this is my first post here.

My mother said that I always preferred to play by myself even as a young child, although I still played with my cousins from time to time. I didn't really talk to the adults in my extended family when they came over and I remember hiding from them until my father came and got me. When I was about 5 I remember my father dropping me off at this class they enrolled me in at the local community centre. My older sister was already there for 2 years. My dad took me to the teacher on the first day and I refused to let go of my dad. She tried to coax me by telling me if I continued to cling to my dad like that he'd get small. I just shook my head. I don't remember how they got me to let go but apparently I did. At school, I had two friends but they were twins and they were my neighbours so I knew them before. I wanted to make more friends but I was too shy. I wouldn't talk to teachers. Idk if this is noteworthy but once during a test the teacher was passing around and when he saw my answers he made a comment about how it looked like I revised my work. For some reason, I thought he was making fun of me and changed my answers and when he passed back he was really confused as to why I changed my answers especially as he made that comment. Anyway, as I grew older I was able to talk to them but only to answer when they asked me something. I remember in Year 6 I had to present a thing together with another student in front of the class. I dreaded it and I wished I had gotten sick so I could stay home. It was just a few lines and I couldn't finish it. The teacher thought that I hadn't prepared and I got in trouble. \n\nBy the time of secondary school I was fine talking to my peers even if they weren't close friends or not in the same class. However, I still couldn't talk to teachers unless spoken to. I never asked them a question in or out of the classroom. I avoided them out of the classroom. I never went to the staff room except with a friend and they did the talking. With especially strict teachers I would feel like I was going to throw up because I kept thinking what if they called on me to answer. My hands would get cold and would sweat. Most teachers I couldn't even ask to go to the toilet. Sixteen years old and I couldn't do that. In Year 12 I remember my chemistry teacher had called on me to answer but I just couldn't even though I knew the answer. Nothing came out. She quickly moved on though. Every single one of my teachers told my parents that I \"needed to come out of \\[my\\] shell.\" I got grades though, mostly As and some Bs.\n\nI dreaded university. There was no way I'd be able to function there. I was supposed to be an adult. I avoided face-to-face, one-on-one interaction with my lecturers as much as I could. There were a few a few times that I just froze but they were nice about it. Email reduced a lot of stress for me. I wasn't the most social person but I was able to talk to other students fairly normally (at least in my eyes) though I do think that I came across as shy and reserved.\n\nThe first job that I had ever gotten I left because everyday and every minute my stomach felt queasy and I'd hide in the bathroom sometimes to try to catch my breath. I wasn't super chatty or anything but it was horrible. I didn't want to quit but I did. I just couldn't do it. I was extremely lucky though. The grant thing covered most of my tuition and my parents were able to cover the rest. I switched over to online or distant learning after a while, before the pandemic had hit. My mother has a small business and I'd would help out when I could. Most times I didn't really need to talk to help someone. I never understood how my mother could just strike up a casual conversation with customers. We mostly see the same customers everyday since it's in a semi-rural area. Some of these customers I've been seeing since I was a child.\n\nI know I have social anxiety and I've been trying to help myself however I can since I can't afford therapy and a lot of people around me don't really understand why I can't just talk to people. I learned about trying to calm myself down with breathing techniques and how to approach the catastrophizing way of thinking before a situation and reducing the \"postmortem\" I tend to do.

His SM has never ever been a problem for me and I hardly ever notice he doesn\u2019t speak tbh because I love him no matter what. \n\nBut recently it\u2019s been becoming a problem for me when I catch him whispering to his mom or dad and this sort of frantic jealous rage starts in my stomach. Now I never lash out at him when I see this or make him feel horrible for it because I know he doesn\u2019t do it on purpose and it\u2019s his anxiety that is stopping him from ever speaking to me but regardless it\u2019s still hard for me. SM doesn\u2019t just effect the person afflicted with it, it also effects the ones around them especially loved ones and I think sometimes people don\u2019t understand that.\n\nThis past week we stayed at a coworkers house to help bird sit his birds while he was on vacation and everything was mainly fine, until nighttime when his mom would call and he would hafta run to the bathroom and lock himself up so I couldn\u2019t hear him. Again I never said anything or made him feel bad about it but it\u2019s just hard to know that the love of my life needs to hide from me to speak. I guess it\u2019s because you don\u2019t ever want to feel like your partners afraid of you and that\u2019s what it feels like when he needs to go somewhere else to talk on the phone.\n\nOther instances are when I come around the corner and I see him look over at me and immediately stop talking to his mom or dad or when he looks back to see if I\u2019m around before speaking to his mom. It just hurts because I know he doesn\u2019t do it on purpose but I don\u2019t like the feeling of him needing to hide from me. It\u2019s gotten to the point that I try not to go to his house or his dads house with him anymore because I don\u2019t want to see him not be able to talk to me. \n\nMy bf is everything I\u2019ve ever wanted in life and I don\u2019t want to accidentally hurt him by saying something negative when these feelings pop up and I defiantly wanna move out with him soon but I know I won\u2019t be able to until he speaks to me fully. I know it\u2019s not me and it has nothing to do with me or how comfortable he is around me but how can I stop feeling these jealous waves when I see him talking or hear stories about him talking to other friends especially when I\u2019m supposed to be his life partner.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3673, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How can I be better for him?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/iqaw3g/how_can_i_be_better_for_him/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ginaaa22", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4dmfexv4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1599745308, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/iq3i6g/selective_mutism_is_dangerous_when_things_get/", "gildings": {}, "id": "iq3i6g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "d9cc5c10-ce05-11ea-8912-0e09c6836c7f", "link_flair_text": "Trigger Warning ", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/iq3i6g/selective_mutism_is_dangerous_when_things_get/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1599745318, "score": 1, "selftext": "(TW: sexual assault) On one hand, I cant talk about my sexual desires with a partner. It feels like if my throat closes up. If I do get words out at all, they will be almost impossible to understand. Usually by the time I communicate a sexual desire, the guy is no longer in the mood. \n\nBut on a more serious note, there have been times when i couldn't ask someone to stop, or ask them to get away from me. I've found that sometimes guys will misread you scooting away or trying to push them as playful.. maybe playing rough? I dont know. and im such an anxious person that if i push and they don't let up, ill usually just let something happen. I learned to disassociate early in life (for non sexual reasons) it was a good coping strategy as a kid, but the dissasociation on top of the SM has prevented me from protecting myself a couple of times, usually at parties where I'm already overwhemed or oversocialized.\n\nI have this reputation for being a little slutty. But I think its not fair because I would have had much less sex if I was able to say the words \"no\". Im also autistic so I've definitly misread obvious sexual signals as being friendly, which really sucks. So I have PTSD from what felt like rapes to me, but what the guys genuinly beleived to be conpletely consentual encounters. \n\nIt was the same dang story over and over. The guys would flirt, I would go with it without realizing. OR WORSE I would try to match their energy (so I would flirt back, without even realizing that that's what I was doing) The guys would give clear indications that they wanted to have sex, I would be oblivious and go with it without realizing. They would start to make me uncomfortable, but like 93% of human interaction makes me uncomfortable so I wouldn't know where to draw the line until it was too late.\n\n Next thing I know we are in a seperate room and they start kissing me. I get confused and frightened and cue the SM, If I stumble away from them, they hold me closer. Instead of fighting, I start to dissasociate. I tune everything out, and the next thing I know there's just this horrible Pain. I come out of my dissasociation periodically and try to move away, but at this point I'm feeling very weak and nervous and don't have a lot of fight in me, so my attempts at getting away are weak and unconvincing. They think im playing around or trying to get them to be rough, they don't realize how badly I want them to just be far, far away from me. I count down from 100 over and over until it stops. They finish, and them they just act like normal. \n\nIts as though everything is fine. They tell all their friends what I let them do.. The reputation gets even worse, which puts me at even more risk of it happening again. \n\nI have no way to call out for support because I was never really raped. The guys genuinly didn't know how I felt.

probably the worst decision i have ever made in my life. ever since i began school i was the quiet kid. i didn\u2019t speak unless spoken to, i didn\u2019t speak until i was required to speak. this of course led to me have no friends. however, i didn\u2019t realize i didn\u2019t have friends at the time; i don\u2019t think i even knew what the concept of a friend was. i go to school, do my things, and go straight home. i mean, we\u2019re all in the same class, we\u2019re all designated a seat at lunch, we\u2019re all \u201cfriends\u201d right? wrong. 5th grade graduate me was in for a shock \n\nin comes middle school. so far it\u2019s the norm, i\u2019m doing my things doing the work everything fine. then comes our first lunch. no ones assigned to sit anywhere. everyone has already created their friend groups everyone already has a place they wanna sit. i don\u2019t. i mean i don\u2019t talk to anyone so i sit alone. it\u2019s normal for me so far i guess i mean how bad can this get. anyways after we finish our food we\u2019re required to go outside into this courtyard to allow people a place to sit. out here everyone has their circle, their own little section of the courtyard. i don\u2019t. i don\u2019t now anyone. i just decide to sit down by myself and wait it out. throughout the year this is my routine. summer starts and i just spend my time playing video games. but this is where i meet my first friend. someone i knew form home would play black ops 2 with me. we would occasionally play zombies or quickscopes but that was about it. i didn\u2019t have a mic so it was just messages, hops, and crouching to communicate. eventually he invited me to play with these other guys. i have a lot of fun, but i can\u2019t talk to them. i don\u2019t have a mic and my parents won\u2019t buy me one. i really want to talk to them but i can\u2019t. we play for the majority of the summer and they\u2019ve never heard me speak. this was just casually so they never asked me to be a part of their group. \n\n7th grade begins and it\u2019s basically the same thing, but now i\u2019m getting more and more anxious to speak. now instead of sitting in the courtyard i decided to sit in the library where i\u2019m away from all the peoples stares and the feeling i\u2019m starting to get from said stares. but most of the time security doesn\u2019t let me sit in the library because they don\u2019t understand that my index finger pointing in the direction of the library is where i\u2019m heading so i sit alone in the courtyard again. a few weeks later the xbox dudes come to me and invite me to walk (kids naturally decided to form a one way circle of walking around the courtyard for some reason) so i nodded and joined them. \u201cso you\u2019re the kid who doesn\u2019t talk?\u201d they say and i have this weird feeling of anxiety. suddenly my eagerness to talk to them turns into anxiety and i just nod again. they seem weirded out at first but just go with it cause i\u2019m the guy who doesn\u2019t talk right. i feel relieved and i just awkwardly walk around with them uncomfortably. the next few days were just on and off of walking or the library and they didn\u2019t seem to question me. winter break comes alone and we all play ghosts and have a fun time and even though i bought a mic i still chose not to talk to them. spring starts and it\u2019s the same thing. in my classes i sometimes talked but it was rare. summer starts and it\u2019s more xbox. we get our new schedules and it turns out i have class with a few of the xbox guys. i get a little nervous but i continue in with my last few days of summer \n\n8th grade starts and i\u2019m extremely nervous to be with them. i don\u2019t want them to hear me talk. during attendance i just raised my hand. next i have this rotc class and the dude expects us to yell present and an aries. i ofc was freaking out and chose to be absent all week until i told my councilor to get me out. my first week was rough. eventually we had to do these presentations and i would refuse and soon enough i made a name for myself as the kid who doesn\u2019t talk. school was terrible for me but xbox guys still let me sit with them at lunch. surprisingly i made friends with this mute persona and people actually became accustomed to me not talking. summer starts xbox blah blah \n\n9th grade starts

It's most evident in work and comes across as extreme shyness. This was also the same when I was at school too.\n\nI recently discovered the link between SM and anxiety and it's started a train of thought about an unresolved issue I had aged 4/5.\n\nOn the advice of my teacher (who was worried about my lack of speech) my mum took me to a SLT, when we were there, my younger sister answered my questions for me. The SLT dismissed this (over confident sister) as the reason why I had learned not to speak in public and dismissed us. It's not told as funny family story. But I'm beginning to think that I was in fact a SM. A lot of what I've read in SM has definite parallels to my life.\n\nAs an adult, I live what many would consider is a good life, I have friendships, relationships, a steady job. But I can never shake the feeling of underachieving or perhaps coasting. Feeling someway that I am being held back by my shyness in contributing to larger group/work meetings.\n\nPerhaps it's millennial entitlement, and I'm just going through a tough time. But I'd love to speak to (no pun intended) anyone who realised they were a selective mute later in life, and I'm interest to read about how everyone deals with the anxiety associated with it.\n\nThanks", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3624, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "30 year old former SM", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/immjmn/30_year_old_former_sm/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "philokingo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_30un8yfa", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1599169850, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/im32cf/physical_changes_in_the_body/", "gildings": {}, "id": "im32cf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/im32cf/physical_changes_in_the_body/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1599169861, "score": 1, "selftext": "Let's say, someone hasn't spoken for years on end in childhood and early adulthood.

He suddenly found himself in a 20 minute classroom where he was the only student with 3 teachers - The teacher, the special education teacher, and a classroom helper. He was even talking in what he calls his \u201creal voice.\u201d \n\nBut about a month in, things started spiraling out.  Nothing had changed at home - I mean, other than what was happening to everyone else in our country - but instead of being enthusiastic (that\u2019s probably an exaggeration) he wasn\u2019t interested in interacting with the teachers anymore.  He reverted to old in-person habits of acting tired and putting his head down or even hiding under our dining room table. \n\nAlong with this return of old behaviors, we\u2019ve had to begin monitoring certain OCD behaviors.  They had been slightly present when very little but they\u2019ve really turned up in the past month or two.  Though he doesn\u2019t have a problems getting filthy and being in direct, he has begun washing his hands on a more-than-needed basis.  Or he\u2019ll insist on hand sanitizer and become upset if not given even a droplet. \n\nMy wife and I (me mostly, as she\u2019s the primary bread winner) may be homeschooling him and our 4 year old - thank fucking god they get along. Virtual school, even for a 1st grader is supposedly going to be 3 hours a day.  \n\nBy the end of his 20 minute kindergarten sessions everyone was worn out and upset.  We just can\u2019t. \n\nI think at the beginning of this post it was to ask for homeschooling advice, by the end it may be more about needing to just type out my feelings.

As a child, I was so talkative towards my family about my interests, but when it came to school, I barely talked to anyone besides my small group of friends, and I was felt like it was hard to talk to people, and I felt like I couldn\u2019t really say anything, and I still do feel that way. I feel like it\u2019s gotten very worse though. I feel like I can\u2019t talk to people who aren\u2019t my mom, or sister since I\u2019ve become much more distant from my family. When I\u2019m faced with a stranger or person I don\u2019t know, I just freeze up, and can\u2019t get any thing out and we just sit in silence. But when I talked to my sister a few moments later, I could talk just fine, but I talk in a whisper most of the time now a days for whatever reason that I still don\u2019t know yet.\nI\u2019ve been to therapy and my therapist and mom both agreed that I have selective mutism, but I didn\u2019t stay in therapy long enough to get some kind of diagnosis besides depression and anxiety since I was very tired of leaving my house due to my depression. \nI\u2019ve always not been able to talk in class, and I do stutter as well, but that\u2019s not really the main focus since i can\u2019t talk to people in general and I just go very nonverbal when I try to say things to people I\u2019m not comfortable with including classmates I\u2019ve known for years and have had classes with. I prefer to text things most of the time. \nThe thing is that...I don\u2019t talk much at home either. I just like to be quiet and I\u2019m just a huge ball of silence at home and in public along with my freezing up, and being nonverbal around others.\nI\u2019ve been so confused about this for years now, and my life has been a struggle for as long as I remember. \nEven when I\u2019m forced to talk, I can only say one or two words and that\u2019s it.

I also have difficulties talking to people, even over text. Calling is something I despise. I have disorders such as ADHD, Autism, Depression, Anxiety, and possibly more that could be undiagnosed. My Anxiety is also so bad, I usually feel sick when leaving the house and feel like vomiting when I have to talk.\n\nLately, as in the past few weeks (or months(I haven\u2019t really kept track of time)), I\u2019ve been more unable to talk; especially to people I don\u2019t know or not very close to. When I try to talk, it hurts. Usually, it will feel like my throat is full of cotton balls, packing peanuts, animal bedding, or other items similar. I don\u2019t exactly know how to describe the feeling exactly as it feels.\n\nEven if it hurts, I keep trying to the point where I make weird sounds. For example, I will try to say \u201chello\u201d and make an odd sound instead. Even today in class, my teacher called on me and I tried to say \u201chere,\u201d but I made a weird \u201cere\u201d sound quietly and just raised my hand instead.\n\nMy throat has been in almost constant pain for at least over 3 weeks. I\u2019m making stupid decisions to keep on talking, but I don\u2019t want to be seen as weird, especially to my family since they will probably say I need to talk more for this to go away. Or put me on Anti-Depressants, since that seems like their go-to.\n\nCurrently, the only people I can talk to is family (sometimes it does hurt to talk though), close friends or people I know very well, and well, I can usually speak to people when I need help or am asking a question, but I usually talk very quietly. So, I can talk to close people more, family a bit less, and strangers (when I or they need help) even less.\n\nTruthfully, I feel like I\u2019m faking it, even though I\u2019m not. It\u2019s so bad I can\u2019t even talk to myself or pets in private. I do need some help figuring out if this is SM or not. I know I should probably tell my parents or doctor, but I just want at least a little help so I don\u2019t end up messing things up. And I especially don\u2019t want to waste money to find out I\u2019m just quiet.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m making it sound like I\u2019m scared of becoming SM, but I\u2019m not really. I\u2019m just really scared the people I know will think less of me or be disappointed.\n\nSorry if some things are written badly or not enough was written down because I tried to write this as quick as possible.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3583, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do I Have SM?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/ie0drc/do_i_have_sm/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Fushigibama", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11jp3s", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1598022754, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/idyj8x/i_can_respond_to_questions_just_fine_but_i_cannot/", "gildings": {}, "id": "idyj8x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/idyj8x/i_can_respond_to_questions_just_fine_but_i_cannot/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1598022764, "score": 1, "selftext": "I cannot be the one who say something first.

Personally I've only had a few instances of voice callers being difficult, but sitting in the office I hear plenty of other workers trying to explain our service to people who clearly just want to hang up on us, and it's making me really scared of making calls, to the point (and obviously I know this is bad of me) I have to disconnect users if they're trying to call a number I don't already know will take our calls, since I freeze up and know I won't be able to speak to the person on the other end. I feel really bad about it but I don't know what else to do, and I'm embarrassed I got myself into a job like this when I knew already I have trouble speaking sometimes.\nSorry if I went on a bit of a tangent there, but does this sound like selective mutism? I guess I'm confused because it seems like all of the examples are people saying \"I can't talk to adults\" or \"I can't talk at school\", which aren't things that have ever really applied to me.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3571, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is this SM?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/ichvug/is_this_sm/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "enricofermi5784", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_26j5ak6c", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597717639, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/ibsgy6/do_i_have_sm/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ibsgy6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/ibsgy6/do_i_have_sm/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597717650, "score": 1, "selftext": "I only recently discovered that this was a common issue but I think I may have always had it to some degree.

I've been researching a bit and what I found says that someone can have selective mutism as a symptom of PTSD. Anyway, I would like to clear some doubts about this, more specifically about my case, and any answer is welcome.\n\nBriefly: I suspect I have selective mutism, or maybe I have. It started at age 10 and continues today, at 16. I mean, possibly. For the last year and a half there have been no face-to-face classes because of the pandemic, so I don't know if I can speak now (I don't speak in online classes either). What I mean is that at age 10 (before this period I went through some traumatic experiences, and I have reason to believe that I may have developed PTSD) I stopped talking at school like I said. And only at school. My god, before that, I was extremely outgoing. The kind that was friends with everyone in the room. But at that time I literally didn't speak to anyone. And something that makes me a little \"confused\" when writing this is that I can't say with certainty that it's selective mutism. Yes, I really think it is. But during that time I was just a kid, and my life was pretty stressful at that point. What I mean is that I never paid attention to the fact that I didn't say anything. I thought it was normal. Not normal, but you know, I never really stopped to think about it like I'm doing now. Also, luckily, even dumb, all my colleagues and teachers were always understanding (as far as possible). so I've never been in an embarrassing situation for not being able to answer a question or something like that, as many report here. That's why I say no that I don't remember very well what it felt like to try to speak or be questioned. So, it turns out that towards the end of last year, I decided to do some research on the internet about it, not specifically, and I ended up coming across social phobia (which I also strongly suspect I have) and from then on I started looking for more information. mental disorders and see if maybe one fit me. I got to see about selective mutism a while later, but it was a bit of a quick read and I ended up discarding it because I thought only younger children developed it, which apparently isn't true. And that's basically it.\n\nWhat I would like to ask is: do you think that. given my situation (assuming it is selective mutism or not) would I be able to speak at school next year? And if it's not selective mutism, what could it be? Also, as I asked at the beginning, but can selective mutism be a symptom of PTSD? And if so, is the treatment the same as for \"traditional\" mutism? \n\nI'm using Google Translate, so I apologize for any typos.

When I was at school I didn't talk if I didn't have the obligation to, I was always working by myself. \nSurprisingly I always made one friend in every class ( a new one every year, then I avoid the last one ), I honestly never knew why they wanted to stay with me at school... I barely talk they were the only one talking during conversations, I was just nodding or shrug and say \"Yes\" \"No\" or \"Ok\". I think it was either pity or they thought it was cool to being the only able to talk to me, but It doesn't matter they made the time pass faster anyway and they were kind and helpful to me.\nAlso I never go outside of my house except to go to school, so my definition of \"a friend\" is a bit different even if I considered myself close to them, we didn't seem that close from the outside. Because they were hanging out with other friends outside of school.\n\nI am 17 now and not totally recovered from my possible SM but I clearly improved because for the first time this year I am in a class where nobody knew me and didn't know that I usually don't talk so they started to talk to me normally ( it didn't happened in a long time because of my \"quiet kid\" reputation) and surprisingly I talked to them back normally too ( \"normally\" is maybe a big word ). But it's been only a few months since I am in this class and I hope they won't assume I don't want to talk to them later this year because of my introversion, like a lot did back then. I honestly think I am just glad to finally be in a class of mature people.\n\n( In my childhood, I didn't had trouble to communicate with others even with my introversion I had a little group of friends and was outgoing with them. )", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5621, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do you think I have SM based on my story ?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/qc5dkl/do_you_think_i_have_sm_based_on_my_story/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "pearybeary_", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_evxyl9po", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1634741357, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/qc2ktp/is_this_selective_mutism/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qc2ktp", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/qc2ktp/is_this_selective_mutism/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1634741369, "score": 1, "selftext": "So looking back I remember in school from preschool til 4th grade I do not talk at all at school. I literally do not say a word at all, when a teacher talk to me or if a classmate talk to me. Everyone just keep saying that I\u2019m shy or refer me to that girl that doesn\u2019t talk. But when I\u2019m home I\u2019m very chatty and my parents always say that I\u2019m very outgoing. But when in school I just shut down and don\u2019t say anything. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until in 5th grade, one of my teacher got mad at me for not talking. She gave me a really long lecture forcing me to talk which I eventually did. After I talked my classmate want to talk to me and I eventually end up talking to them. I was saying one word at first and I don\u2019t even know how but I eventually was able to open up and become very social. I made some friends but I only talk to the people in my friend group and no one else besides that.\n\nSo fast forward in middle school and high school, I kind of lost all my friends and don\u2019t really talk again. But now I only talk when I\u2019m being spoken to other than that I don\u2019t talk or be able to show my personality. \n\nNow I\u2019m in college and I\u2019m having the same issue. I can\u2019t make myself talk to my classmate or ask for help unless someone comes to me first. Even then I have a hard time trying to socialize.

WHY would i fake this, especially when i was a little kid? don't you think after being like this for over a DECADE, it's kind of obvious that it's real? i don't think the average kid would be resilient enough to maintain an act like that for so long. and what really sucks about this is it's always been my family accusing me of faking it, and i can't defend myself. \n\n7. i'm scared i won't be able to speak to my best friend if/whenever we meet. yeah, this one is pretty specific, but it's such an important one to me. if i can't speak to him, it will hurt me so fucking bad. i know he'll get it, but i don't wanna be voiceless with him :(\n\n8. i'm so behind. i need a job. i need to do normal life things. it's just so out of reach. more than just selective mutism has contributed to that, but SM is definitely a huge factor. \n\n9. i don't really hate this one, but i can talk in my dreams. the people i talk to are always my best friend or members of my favorite bands, just people that mean the world to me. those dreams always make me so happy, but they're also a reminder of what i don't have in real life. gotta love the subconscious. \n\n10. simply, it makes me feel so sad and stuck and lonely and tired =/\n\nthat's all i can think of at the moment. hopefully this resonates with you guys &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5612, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "things i hate about having selective mutism.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/qbooeb/things_i_hate_about_having_selective_mutism/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "riskygoldfish", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "0ab735ee-8171-11e9-8a25-0ef95564d0f4", "author_flair_text": "Diagnosed SM", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_68ovm158", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1634680781, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/qbm34j/success/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qbm34j", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "6684262a-d4b4-11e9-b542-0ee117484ce8", "link_flair_text": "Success", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/qbm34j/success/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1634680791, "score": 1, "selftext": "today i went in the store and through the checkout by myself, even managed to answer the cashier!

it\u2019s a severe form of anxiety, and trust me if i could talk i would but it\u2019s like my throat closes up. i also feel like i should add that i\u2019m currently undergoing the process of being diagnosed with autism. so does anyone have any advice on what to do?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5552, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "why are people with selective mutism still forced into oral presentations?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/q3xy42/why_are_people_with_selective_mutism_still_forced/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "naturAddicted", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7fhoua5c", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1633643369, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/q3jk15/selective_mutism_questionnaire_update/", "gildings": {}, "id": "q3jk15", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2efe4224-937f-11e9-9b3a-0e7080e6db1c", "link_flair_text": "General Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/q3jk15/selective_mutism_questionnaire_update/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "0I34HHuYRLjaI7bW-qzGUNvk63Ae_hBSl8tgyQ7P4Gc", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/aLuGKA0xrzZyabb6ArDqiNfjtmNJHwklbRnSgmXyB00.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f1ffd3801bafc59a7f05a92a51b7b551f98da4e", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/aLuGKA0xrzZyabb6ArDqiNfjtmNJHwklbRnSgmXyB00.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=971bd0f632d1c141cee0772b86ace939c6238f71", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/aLuGKA0xrzZyabb6ArDqiNfjtmNJHwklbRnSgmXyB00.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db7e5ecbbabec8b9790efa8cc089e4e827c0f410", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/aLuGKA0xrzZyabb6ArDqiNfjtmNJHwklbRnSgmXyB00.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cb8b0f277f2f55068c48c4bd35c5f7552722250", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/aLuGKA0xrzZyabb6ArDqiNfjtmNJHwklbRnSgmXyB00.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=507f6dc86cefa0ac3e9e60d680e5d662cac39372", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/aLuGKA0xrzZyabb6ArDqiNfjtmNJHwklbRnSgmXyB00.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5075192bf61f9fb6809f57bed87947e5d458d052", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/aLuGKA0xrzZyabb6ArDqiNfjtmNJHwklbRnSgmXyB00.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f64437b01ca75663ab4c77407e0c8dbbb402cc5c", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1633643380, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey everyone, it's me again.

I had a job interview today and I was really nervous, I thought I'd end up freezing up or just not being able to say everything I want to say. I used to be so scared to talk to people even online but I have made progress with that! I also have a temporary job as a cleaner which isn't much socialising but yeah... I only got it because I know the manager. At work there's only really one person I kind of talk to but I'm not able to say what I want to say, like I just cant. Even when I've practiced things in my head a lot, so only 1-2 worded answers come out. I think i'm so used to people not wanting to talk to me as well so that makes it harder. No one else really talks to me there and I know people say I'm very quiet and one guy even asked me if I was shy to my face. I hate being called shy but I kind of panicked and said yes? Anyways this isn't the point of this post. \n\nSo as I said, I had a job interview today and was so anxious about it but I was able to answer the questions and talk with my interviewer and I actually felt really relaxed, I didn't feel much anxiety while I was there either. I managed to say most of what I wanted to say and it felt like I didn't even have selective mutism at that time. I do still struggle with it though (especially around some family members and friends). I don't know if I got the job yet but I'm so proud of myself for actually being able to go through with the interview. The job is at costa coffee so if I do get it, I will have to speak to a lot more people and try to form relationships with other staff which is hard for me but I'll try as hard as I can. I just wrote this to basically say that it is possible to do things like this, even though it can be really hard? Hopefully it was helpful for anyone struggling. I didn't think I'd be able to do it but I pushed myself to go and do it and I practiced a lot. I'm still shocked that I actually did it! Hopefully I do get the job...

I've never had anyone mention it (so I assume it's not that prominent), but it's not something I'm willingly doing. I think around 7th grade is when it started so idk if it has something to do with nodding my entire life....or some form of PTSD. In 7th grade I was exposed by my friend in private that I watched porn, and then another 'friend'....although I had forgiven him then (although I really didn't, I mainly didn't want him to come apologizing to my door about what he did since my mom had no clue, and to this day has no clue....and it's not something I want to discuss if it's not necessary)....I have truly forgiven him now (and have reconnected on Xbox, although not a lot), as current me would not care about such things.....but he spread that info around school. And the prior summer to that year, it actually went around with online 'friends'....with my face to it and they made memes out of the situation....instagram's like feature being so open then....without me knowing, fucked me. So it happened twice, and I was never affected by online bullying before, but I didn't do anything with porn for a solid 9 months after that online incident. That lack of doing so/whole experience, led to a lot more OCD with contamination; when it comes to sex, I literally do not know how I'd mentally go about it because I can't get over the cleanliness of it. I eventually want a relationship, and it's not that I don't want all that comes with it (as much as I equally don't), it's just I can't get over the cleanliness of it. Back when, I didn't really care about any of that. I was actually kind of gross.\n\nI was just bad with it all back then, and it came back to bite me. I think that's why I'm so bad with girls in any capacity nowadays because I have that 'creep' notion in my mind. Back in 6th grade I'd sit with probably the most attractive girl in the grade and it wasn't an issue. Her and her friend who was a boy would always try to get me taking and shit, and it was fine. Past 6th grade, it sucked because I think that notion was around me until the end of school, I also had a Youtube channel started in 9th grade (more than likely permanently quit this year) where there was an inside joke about this girl, within my friend group....**The joke goes:** \\[joke\\], like \\[girl's name\\].......so I carried it to the YouTube channel and it was funny, I used her first name but never her last name. I never meant to be harmful to her personally...but in computer class, I admitted who it was to....I figure a few people; they'll keep it to themselves, right? (this is all still 9th grade)....no it goes around the entire school and now I have her friends following me on instagram....one actually confronted me in school and what do I do? Nothing, I just keep walking...I didn't say anything. And ofc I get mad online, calling her a 'bitch' and making posts....but I realize now that I shouldn't of done what I did, and I regret that. I don't regret the joke but I regret telling who it was inspired by, because that was never my intent to harm them personally, I figured I could've trusted those I told, but it's not like I ever told them to keep it to themselves (but I never thought to)....and I could talk a few words to the correct people in the correct settings, but I wasn't saying more than a few words to anyone, more than my friends...I had too much trust in people. In time I ditched that joke, I was already planning to because it was getting old....but that made me, and past that time, I never made it again. Harm wasn't my goal. Then I realized I DID NOT need that joke to be funny. It all went wrong.\n\nIf a girl comes to me now and is very friendly and upfront with me, I'm fine these days. Although I don't talk so there's that, and that's not something that happens a lot......it's all getting better in general, but yeah. That's the last week about......I'm getting better looking around in public without being self-conscious about it......BUT, I am still very self-conscious about how I physically look......I don't like my appearance. I don't think I'm ugly, I just hate how I look. \n\nAlthough speaking progress is the worst it's been in a few months. I also had dreams last night where I was talking to a lot of different girls I used to know, and other people from my highschool...talking, but my family would appear and I would stop....Talking in dreams is new since the last 3 months....before that it was so rare, I can't recall it happening. I always used to feel so lonely in dreams....I never liked them, but tonight I did....and those dreams were just casual. I don't like when they're not, as per my contamination OCD. I'm trying to keep this post somewhat, not so, graphic. I'm trying to be honest with all my thoughts though.\n\nAlso my hands shake in similar situations to the head twitching, which I'd assume some others hand's shake. Though sometimes they're still as ever. I used to think it was very odd, I'd like to think that hand shaking started around the same time... but I'm guessing that's more likely related to the SM than the other....or not, idk.\n\nI also kind of want to try medicine for SM, but at the same time I don't. As I fear I could change in ways current me would be uncomfortable with....and I also don't want to admit to wanting to use it either...idk.\n\nSo that's my mind for now.", "send_replies": true,

I get hella offended. I have a bad feeling this is going to turn into a messy he said she said kind of thing.  I had selective mutism growing up.  Now it could be seen as social anxiety, but idk what it is. My friends see me as confident, while others the quiet one. \n\nFor example telling an uncle I was listening to a relative say all these offensive things about me over the phone to someone. He\u2019s aware of my anxiety and my life story but part of what he said to me included  \u201cshe doesn\u2019t even know you can hear her.  Or don\u2019t like it.  Maybe when u feel comfortable you can tell her, like you do with auntie Anna who gets annoying.    Someone with a strong personality like aunt Jane and auntie Jade would tell her off and scream at her. Your other uncle would tell someone off to their face as well. I\u2019m scared of People like them (thinks he\u2019s a nice guy). If you did do it she would hate you.   But....\u201d I don\u2019t remember what else he said. But anyways, I was thinking what even is a strong personality? So is the opposite a weak personality? Is that it.   It made me have this feeling, like I refused to accept that being quiet and withdrawn IS my personality. It\u2019s my disorder!\n\nExample 2.   I once had an online fling with a guy from another country. Definitely didn\u2019t work out after he found a gf. Anwyays I was telling my friend Suzan all about it constantly.  And she knows me quite well.  Back then I once texted her jokingly \u201cI\u2019m like cat fishing. I look nothing like this irl.\u201d Then Suzan replies saying \u201cyou look exactly the same. You\u2019re pretty.   It\u2019s the personality.  You\u2019re more confident over text, but in real life \ud83d\ude2c\u201d and that offended me.   I know this and think this about myself, but hearing her message it made me mad. \n\nYou type more than you talk made me mad. Even though I know it can be true, maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s an insecurity and hearing someone else (esp the friend that naturally has gotten my skin so many times with her self proclaimed bluntness. Yet she\u2019s still the one friend I always end up going to tell about my life problems)   \n\nThis friend has a knack for getting under my skin, for years now. I\u2019ve told her about my anxiety disorder before btw- I was like YEAH because of my disorder. I can easily be confident around people i trust and told her it depends who I\u2019m comfortable with. I told her once or twice and she never remembers how it works, but she does know I have anxiety. \nSo I thought about how I have literally thought the same thing about her. She\u2019s an awkward mf, and we\u2019ve talked about how we relate with feeing awkward. So I\u2019m I tell her it\u2019s the same with her, and she goes \u201cI talk a lot\u201d.  Yeah more than me to anyone around her, but she\u2019s still and awkward mf. \n\nThis was brought up a second time when we planned to meet up and she wrote \u201cand you better be this talkative when I see you tomorrow, or I swear I\u2019ll kill u\ud83d\ude02\u201d. Or something. Then I got mad and upset, talked about it with someone, then texted her how I felt.  She sent back a lengthy response about how sh*t she feels saying it to someone like me, and that she was joking and bringing up how we talked all the time back in school, plus how the teacher even moved me to another seat back in school, and she\u2019s happy I told her because back then I\u2019m the past I wouldnt have.\n\nThis same friend once said something like \u201cpersonality can\u2019t be fixed\u201d to me over a similar topic. I was offended, like what does that even mean?!    It made me think did my disorder turn into a personality? Because I don\u2019t accept it as my personality. I\u2019m not meant to be bottled up! \n\nThere was a time when I texted Susan something about the guy likes to make girls angry.  And Suz messaged me  \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you angry, even back in school you\u2019re never angry\u201d - that made me upset/mad. But I do say I am a very calm and chill person, but I was also thinking excuse me?!  I was thinking to myself - IM ALWAYS ANGRY.  I\u2019m constantly angry. On the inside, in my mind.  I wish I could express it so freely like normal people do! Then again, it\u2019s not something to admire when in real life people do lose their sht, it\u2019s rather annoying.    On a similar topic this friend once messaged me \u201cyou need to learn how to speak up. Do kickboxing, feel strong!\u201d  \nSee this Susan has annoyed me so many times in the past, despite all that she knows me so well and longer than anyone else - maybe that\u2019s why I still feel the need to text her about my life to vent/rant and nobody else as much in detail\n\nThird example, another friend of mine, Jas, once messaged me \u201cyou\u2019re like me. Quiet in real life, but text a lot on text. Guys from dating apps say to me \u201cyou\u2019re really quiet in a real life\u201d.   Well. It\u2019s good to have a friend you relate to.  But at the same time it made me feel abit sad/bitter towards being described as \u2018quiet\u2019.  \nThen Jas goes on to add But I feel like I\u2019m changing, THATS why I send voice messages instead of text. I don\u2019t like being introverted\u201d and once randomly told me her ideal best friend and boyfriend is someone that talks more than her, someone confident. Her bestie talks more than her. And that her current date was more on the introverted side.  \nWe\u2019re not close, but we act close and want to be considered besties. I wanted to say to her twice: do I not meet your qualifications? Am I not good enough?  Fine?   But I didn\u2019t.  But whatever.  \n\nI wish I could be the same everywhere I go. \nDoes the tendency to go quiet become a personality trait? Or maybe it\u2019s just a mental illness? I\u2019ve grown out of SM. MAYBE its Selective Quietness.  I made a new friend a while back, who loved me because I was a crazy bitch and still wants to be best friends. She\u2019s a loud crazy girl with bipolar. Let\u2019s call her Bianca. Even Bianca had said once about me \u201cshe\u2019s normally shy, and quiet around everyone else, but with me she\u2019s fking retarded\ud83d\ude02\u201d, which made me realise people notice these things.

I've had no motive to talk ever since realizing I'd never get that girl. It was a pot dream. Though I'm thankful it all happened. That pot dream showed me true motivation.\n\nIt's like life, there is zero purpose to life in the end, but you can give life any purpose you want. And like life, talking is the same (not easy, but the same concept). I feel like this new motivation (if it's even motivation yet, idk?) It's about what happened tonight.\n\nMy Dad and I were at the pop-up drag strip, he had his car and I had mine. It was great, I listened to music on the way there...of course I'm super self conscious and only listen to it loudly on the highway. We get 1 pass done after about 2 hours of waiting and get our time slips, so we go back to the line, and we have to go to the specific line 3...so we can race against eachother. Apparently we had skipped the line, but the staff let us by.\n\nAnd my Dad is very overly cautious of other people, he'd never inconvenience anyone purposefully, which it annoys me that's how anal he is about it. And this guy in his car is yelling at us because \"we skipped the line...\" and technically yes we did, though we had no clue, we were confused the hustle and bussle. I just wanted to go tell the guy to 'shut the fuck up!' I feel very bad for my dad because he always gets shit like this thrown on him....but this made me realize that I'm worrying too much about people who do not care about me. \n\nIt drives me to at least for tonight want to continue recovering again because I don't want assholes like this controlling my life...when they have no matter to my life. Eventually I'll meet good people and when I do, they'll be worth my life.\n\nAnd I understand their anger, but the lack of understanding is what annoyed me, we're people....come talk to my dad before just assuming us to be 'assholes who cut the line.' I get that someone being skipped makes me feel worthless in the sense and that's where the emotion comes from. \n\nIt really cut deep, I wanted to cry but I stopped myself, closed my fucking windows because people were pissing me off and didn't open them again until 15mins later when my dad wanted to tell me something to me on the line. I thought how being angry and potentially crashing would just be what the guy angry at me would be hoping for....so I changed my thoughts and went in there trying to do my best.\n\nAlthough I just spun the tires but I didn't crash. And I did do better than my last outting.....so that's a win.\n\nAnyway I think I've found something out of nothing. Maybe. Time will tell.\n\nI have to write this on my phone since my laptop is broken, so sorry for the errors if there are any.

I'm 16, and most of my life I've just assumed I had social anxiety, but I always knew it was a bit worse than that. I've had the same friends for years, and I only really feel comfortable talking to them and family, and nobody else. I started college this week, and I was very anxious leading up to it, but I was trying to prepare myself for talking to classmates, having discussions and trying to make friends. However, when I got to the classes and we had to talk to each other in groups, I just froze and couldn't speak. I wanted to at least try to talk to people, but I just didn't have the confidence and was just silent the whole time. I've realised that this has happened a lot in the past. If I didn't know anyone around me in school, I'd often just not talk at all.\n\nHowever, I'm wondering if it's just social anxiety and not selective mutism, as it's ultimately all just because of my inability to start conversations, or talk to people first.

I've given up trying to speak to my family, and have just shut my voice down more and more, I also have locked the door to the room I stay in for most of the day to keep everyone away from me.

In 10th grade, I had focused on talking soo much, anything that involved talking was a \"step in the right direction\" for me. And it honestly was, but it also made me highly submissive in my behavior. Everything I said was some type of joke meant to make other people laugh, or to get them to like me, and if I didn't get a good reaction I'd feel like shit. The thing is, I did gain \"friends\". They probably saw that I was being submissive, and also that I didn't know it. Some of them liked my submissiveness, and no one called it out, I guess cause they thought I'd cry or something (which isn't true, it would've been way better if they had respectfully called out my submissiveness). So because no one called it out, I mostly had no idea I was being so submissive in 10th grade until the summer of 11th grade (I spent 11th grade completely online).\n\nAfter my first week of senior year, even knowing I shouldn't be submissive anymore, it doesn't just go away.\n\nFor me, having the mindset of not being submissive isn't enough to stop it. I wrote down every submissive action that I could remember doing for the day. I don't really try to make jokes or do the shit I did in 10th grade, but if I answered a question from a teacher and got a dull reaction, I feel bad even though I know it shouldn't matter at all.\n\nSo I'm just gonna go mute and work on eliminating the submissiveness. I *could* work on that while trying to talk, but when I talk it's almost always gonna come out as submissive in some way. It's not even that I'm trying to hide it from people, everyone knew I was submissive in 10th. I just get frustrated and it feels like I'm taking steps backwards when I say something submissive.

Though thanks for the 5th Amendment that's not too much of a real legal issue. I'm just lucky the right people were there and the situation was calm overall. Though, I realized then and there...that I feel so little in social situations, I feel like a kid (I'm 18). I like to say I can talk to strangers (I can't talk to my Family) and I can, but it doesn't mean I still can't shutdown or panic internally over it. And I thought maybe I wanted to be something similar (as a job)...someday, but now I don't think I ever want to be that, it's just so socially draining. And I've come to the conclusion that I despise social situations, greatly; especially one's so stressful.\n\nAs much as THIS life of Selective Mutism is so normal to me, the world out there is equally abnormal and fucking terrifying. I want someone to love and someone to love me, but at the same time I want everyone to stay away and never come near me again....and as much as I want these \"normal people\" things, at times (and that time is now), I equally do not want anything to do with them. It's just too much. I just want to be left to my lonesome forever. I wish I was immortal so I could have all the time in the world to get past this. Even if I was able to talk tomorrow, I've NEVER felt like a 'normal person,' I've always felt, I think different from these people. It's hard to believe I could just fit right in with everyone else.\n\nI know with the right motivation, there's the will to push myself to recover (I was once there)...and I hear people who have recovered, all the time saying how you start to realize it's a false sense of security....though at the same time, it's so hard to picture that end ever happening. I don't really picture my life too far into the future, I'm honestly fearful that eventually I may kill myself. I've never made an attempt of such, and the worst I've done with self-harm, is slapped myself (not too hard) within the last few weeks (it made me feel a little better), or hit my hands together hard (when specifically mad at a game, and that just hurt)...that was a while ago, like 2 years ago.\n\nI know eventually I can get past this bad mindset as I have before, but I think my bad mindset now, is rooted in this disease. I just never really came to gripes with it before, so deep. It's also not that I want to give up the opportunity that life is, but I'm just afraid I'll get that low, and can never picture that opportunity being for me, but just for everyone else. I don't feel like anyone else, even here, I feel less normal than each of you. It seems like you have everything more together, and I don't.\n\nI'm 18 but I haven't had any responsibility in my life. I am afraid to be seen as someone who takes their own responsibility. I've cooked this pizza roll, 2 times in the past...but I always did it when no one else was awake or around. This morning my brother wakes up while I'm trying to do it for the 3rd...and he asks around to my sister, if she was cooking it...she wasn't. In time he left for 7-Eleven, and I just put the pizza roll back in the freezer and just went back to bed. Felt like shit.\n\nThe only motivation I carry in my life now, is that to go on Reddit, Wizard101, or Minecraft. Though sometimes I see the worth in none of them, and I just lay on the couch. I'll go to bed at 6pm and wake up at 1am. I actually went to bed at 8pm (last night), and woke up late 11pm (the same day)...and just stayed up until, I went back to bed after feeling defeated with that Pizza Roll.....and some days I'll stay up to 6am like it's nothing...and wake up in the early PMs.\n\nI had hated the doubtful side of those with SM back in July (when I was motivated), now I can't help but to be on that same side.

She was in speech therapy but I didn\u2019t like few therapists we tried. The first one spent most of the time talking to us instead of working with my daughter. The second and third one (the private practice we went to would switch between the two due to scheduling) said some negative things about my DD that made me question their abilities. specifically they said they think I should have her evaluated for autism but I dingy buy it. She makes eye contact with us, smiles, and plays with toys without lining them up. \n\nI talked to my pediatrician and said that she is very shy and won\u2019t talk to anyone. He suggested selective mutism and to go back to speech therapy. I\u2019m not sure what to do because speech therapy was a waste of money that. There have been no major events that would have caused her to go mute. I think it\u2019s behavioral. She has learned to rely on screaming and screeching over the past 2 years and now that\u2019s all she\u2019ll use to communicate. I feel bad but it drives me insane listening to that all day. \n\nI took her out of preschool last year because I started working from home. All she does is scream at the tv or iPad all day when I\u2019m working. She has toys but has no interests in playing with them but shed probably scream at them too. My husband is starting to worry and ask questions to other parents. He is worried she has something wrong with her. I really think it\u2019s behavioral and don\u2019t see the point in wasting time and money to have my kid tested like a lab rat and have a diagnosis handed out like candy. She is SO smart. Before she stopped talking she knew her letters numbers and at only 2!\n\nI feel bad saying all she does is scream but it\u2019s tough to deal with. Even when its time to eat.  She scream at most food given to her.

Another big problem is speaking to my boyfriend normally. I have the same problem with him and sometimes he has to constantly pester me to figure out what the problem is. I know it can be really frustrating to deal with. It gets even worse when i talk about my feelings and problems. When i finally opened up to him about my past i couldn't say a word and had to text him it. A few weeks ago when i opened up about how crap mentally i felt at the time. It resulted us almost taking a break and even though we worked it out. That incident really messed me up for a bit while afterwards and i have retreated back in my little box of keeping my feelings to myself.

I'll sit at the Kitchen table at night with my Mom just hoping she'll talk with me and help my issues be better off.\n\nI feel like all these issues people tend to care about on the day to day, I could give little to no care about. I actually just transferred colleges today and it doesn't concern me, at all. Though I'm still down mentally over my SM issues. In a way I feel like my little care towards anything else makes it hard to make any sort of conversation because I have no focus or care to anything that'd I'd talk about. My Dad will ask me if I know who's singing on the radio to get me to talk, and in that instance I just don't care to respond because it's so uninteresting to me.\n\nI tend to only really talk when asked about my issues. I have tried to talk more fluently, although it's quiet when asked too. I think it all in my mind and I roll with it while speaking, as like I'm thinking in my mind...although it's quiet, as I said. \n\nAnd my main motivation which was really a shot in the dark anyways was the hope I'd potentially talk with this girl...but at the same time I want that, it scares me too much to mention it to my parents or make any moves on my own. I do have their number (but it's via my Mom, which my Mom didn't give me the number, I just took it secretly)...so unless my parents push me...really my Dad since my Mom hasn't mentioned it since probably a day after I crossed paths with her, and even if they do the path of pursuing that, still scares me....and is probably it's own reason as to why I don't want to do anything about it on my own. If I did tell them that was part of the reason I was down, I would also tell them that it scares me at the same time to pursue anything. I've NEVER discussed relationship hopes with anyone before. I only have with my friends and that \"crush\" wasn't even real, I was just so convinced of it by them, that I was like \"sure, whatever\" to them....They think that was my first crush when I had one before that, that was a real crush. I had no real feelings towards that girl, maybe the thought of a relationship but nothing more. \n\n**\\*\\***It's all kind of similar to overcoming SM; in the same way I want to beat it, I don't ever want to talk to anyone ever again. It's as if I want all the benefits of talking without having to talk. Although I just tend to push myself now even with this mindset because I know that it's not in my best interest. **Did anyone that's recovered tend to think this way as well? How has that mindset changed after recovery? Also what goals did you keep as you went along the process?**\n\nI've also started keeping a log with my thoughts on my SM on the daily basis as of today.

Among strangers, I can only really talk to people who are clearly insecure, or those who are aloof.\n\nI'm the least talkative person I know, and I'm trying to figure out the cause behind it.  For a long time I thought it was just ASD, and that still might be the case.  I recently learned more about ADHD, and thought maybe that's it.  I've always been a big day dreamer and could never pay attention in class.  I exhibit traits of both, but I have a great memory (anti-ADHD) and can read people pretty well if I'm paying attention (anti-ASD).\n\nI'm not sure if my mutism is caused by ASD making me nonverbal, or ADHD creating a bunch of white noise that makes it hard for me to tune in, or selective mutism, or just social anxiety.  Throughout my whole life people would tell me to talk more and I'm like, \"...I can't!  I have nothing to say.\"  I do better in 1 on 1 forced convos than in large groups.\n\nI still need to find a therapist (maybe ADHD is making me procrastinate).  But I also actually have a pretty good life.

I never had a chance to feel pride when I was very young, so later when i did get those chances it didn't affect me.(keeping this vague on purpose, I'm gonna elaborate in another post eventually)\n\nI STILL THINK SM IS GENETIC, ill go into that maybe in another post, but after realizing that I had to gain an ego I improved by the largest fucking margin I've seen in my life.\n\nI had always thought \"conquering the fear\" was the way to cure SM, but using that approach nowadays I never had any major change, and only kept making myself feel scared.\n\nWhich is confusing because in 10th grade that was my approach, and It kind of worked.(Will also elaborate in another post) \n\nNow, maybe you might be thinking about the phrase \"love yourself\". The reason \"Love yourself\" never helped me, though I heard it very often online, was probably cause it kind of wasn't for me.\n\nI think that phrase would have the greatest effect to someone whos secure in some areas but (irrationally) insecure in others. Like if your hair is subpar one day and so you're less confident that day. that wouldn't make sense to you because every other day you were fine. You would understand the love yourself message, because you've felt that way in other days, so you understand how to work on your pride to the point that you don't care what others think of your hair.\n\nIn reality, you viewed the people who would judge your hair as worth nothing to you, and so what they think now looks insignificant.\n\nNow I realize that the \"semifriends\" (people i talked to often but i stopped talking to them a while a go cause of reasons involving envy, I *might* elaborate on this) that I had never even told me to love myself. Maybe its cause I never directly asked for confidence help, though I didn't do it for sure a few times indirectly. They also FOR SURE had reason to believe I was suffering.  I don't hate them for that, but it irks me a lot.\n\nFor me, I guess my ego was so astronomically low that the message never clicked for me. I wouldn't say I overlooked the message, but it just wasn't straightforward enough to the point that I could understand it.\n\nWhen I hear it I'm thinking \"love??? whadaya mean, how the hell do I love myself\" so I never really connected it with pride.\n\nMy ego isn't at normal levels right now, but bruh lemme tell you when I realized all of this my ego went from like 0.1 to 2.5 instantaneously. I went from not being able to talk to people when I play apex to talking a LOT, like the \"wall\" just crashed to the point where its now next to nothing. This could also  be because I know I already have many reasons to have pride in myself. This makes me think about the phrase \"work on yourself\", which is another thing (elaborating in another post, im trying not to make this post a megalodon lololololol)\n\nPeople at a 10 are dangerous though, especially when they're in power. I understand that being in power is what gives them that ego, but that's no fucking excuse to ever accept their ways.\n\nThey do things like only work for themselves, pretend to be \"for the people\" cause it benefits them(with no shame too), and generally they think they're right cause almost no one else is worth anything to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. Yes, a lot of this will seem obvious to a lot of people. If it does, then I GUESS THIS MESSAGE WASN'T FOR YOU HUH....\n\nIf it's not for you, it's not for you, move the heck on. Yes, there are people who neeeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED this message (source: me, suffering my entire adolescent and teen life before two days ago).\n\nI'll make more posts, though there's likely gonna be a few days delay as I grow tbh.\n\nThere's just many thoughts running around in my head right now, I have ADHD so this is more than likely really hard to understand lol, I'm trying to share the most important thoughts.\n\nI will make some edits though so if you don't understand something tell me!\n\nEventually I'll make a \"perfect\" post that's clear to understand, as short as possible, and that everyone can benefit from.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5195, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "the biggest change I have ever seen.

I\u2019m able to have conversations with people and interact with others and pass off as someone who is social, when I really am not. I\u2019m very proud of it but theres still situations that come up that I can\u2019t bring myself to say what needs to be said in. \n\nToday at my new job, a coworker that I\u2019m not interested in tried asking me out. Before he tried to ask me out, he was talking nonstop to me about how he needs a girlfriend and I knew he would try to ask me out the second he complained about his lack of girlfriend. I cannot stand this person. I joke around with him when he jokes around, but when we joke around I feel super icked out. I feel like I HAVE to joke with him because if I don\u2019t I will offend him because he makes a pouty face. \n\nThe first time he tried to ask me out, he asked if I have a boyfriend. I said \u201cno and I don\u2019t want one\u201d he then said \u201cwhy not? Im lonely I need a girlfriend. I\u2019m wide open!\u201d I said \u201cwell thats good for you. I\u2019m not.\u201d He said \u201cwell we could hang out sometime\u201d and this is where I couldn\u2019t talk my mind. My mind was screaming \u201cNO. NO. NO.\u201d but my mouth said \u201cyeahhhh\u2026\u2026 we could\u201d but it was a no yeah. It had no in my tone and I tried to make it very obvious that I wasn\u2019t being serious with that \u201cyeah\u201d. Im scared of saying no and offending people. However, I respect my boundaries and I will never date someone that I don\u2019t want to be with. This thing isn\u2019t going anywhere, I\u2019m not gonna let it. But he can\u2019t take a hint and I know I have to tell him no but its so hard. \n\nAfter this situation he cornered me in the supply room and said \u201cI have a prize for you! You have to guess what it is!!\u201d And i was busy, he was interrupting me while I was looking for something for a customer that was waiting on me. That customer could hear this interaction. I said to him \u201cidk what you\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t understand whats going on (i did, he was flirting.), just tell me the surprise then help me look for this item\u201d the surprise was his phone number so we could hang out later. If I just told him no to hanging out, he wouldn\u2019t be doing that. I wanted to scream. \n\nFor the rest of my shift he kept bringing up how his phone # is in my pocket and to not lose it. My facial expressions were very \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude10\ud83e\udd76\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd74. Idk how he didn\u2019t get the hint. I\u2019m very pretty and find myself in these situations often, and each time I freeze up. Its such a vulnerable interaction. Hes known me for 2 days and is way too old for me anyways. I really like this job and don\u2019t wanna quit over this. I\u2019m also extremely worried about getting fired for my rude facial expressions. Ive been doing a great job at my job so far and I\u2019m super polite to everyone but this darned situation is testing me.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5190, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How can I turn a guy down when its super hard?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/ov3h43/how_can_i_turn_a_guy_down_when_its_super_hard/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "wysteria222", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bdwws6yr", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1627709241, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/ov1hvg/sometimes_i_struggle_to_even_talk_through_text/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ov1hvg", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "389d6cec-937f-11e9-9d30-0e6c3cf3f1f6", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/ov1hvg/sometimes_i_struggle_to_even_talk_through_text/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1627709252, "score": 2, "selftext": "I\u2019ve always never been good at speaking but now that I\u2019m a shut in it gets even harder.

I was crying in the car today after my Dad left that car to go test drive my Brother's car (getting fixed).....I choose not to go as I wasn't feeling up to it......And in a way it's kind of Music (I was listening to LAROI in the car when he left on my phone) that's been helping keep my emotions more in check. It's very relatable lately, in particular The Kid LAROI. Well anyway, my Goal to speak by (optimistic) is the 31st...so in 1 hour and 15 mins as I write this...will that happen? Well you never know....\n\nAnyway the mindset has definitely overhauled since I wanted to change exactly 32 days ago. I think I've gone back and forth between this, am I afraid to commit to speaking...or am I still afraid of those reacting. I think I've gone back to the later, I think I'm still afraid of those reacting, in particular my Dad....the thing is if my Parents/Siblings didn't know me, I would be able to speak to them. I've also acquired this thinking that you sort of just speak your mind, right? So conversating wouldn't be that hard....maybe starting a convo since I don't have a lot to talk about....but talking or really typing, online I'm very good at, I can really go off on r/teenagers if you catch me on the right night there (I'm 18).\n\nI think I need to re-convey that mindset to my Mom, since last time I told her...\"the reaction doesn't help....\" something like that, and she relayed that to the family. I think I need to tell her this, \"If you could forget that I didn't speak, I think I'd be able to speak pretty easily.\" I'd still feel odd about it, but I'm sitting in the kitchen tonight, and I'm eating Friendly's my sister brought home....and I'm just coming back from the nightly car show with my Dad in my car....and I haven't been overall happy lately this month, but in that moment it's just a great overwhelming feeling (euphoria) and I feel like my mouth just wants to burst open, but I feel like if I do, that'd be so strange....although I've been talking more in ways I usually didn't just two days ago. I think starting on the 29th is when I committed to really making myself uncomfortable. That was the next day after telling my mom I hated the reaction.\n\nOn the 29th I was going with my Dad to Burger King, and on the way there he had to pick up a movie from the library....so I go in with his card and I talk to the lady, one sentence \"I'm picking up\" (he stays in the car)...and I can talk to strangers although I am nervous....it was fine, I was fine.....it was mainly to do it with my Dad in the realization of me doing it......although once back in the car he was left unsure if I spoke to the lady or not, I did not disclose that to him when he asked.\n\nToday, well idk, I just spoke more....but what it is, is I'm not really surpassing one word or two word phrases with family (besides my Mom sometimes, but I speak very roughly-cut). I feel like maybe I'm falling into a rut here, in that way at least. I think I'm in a very optimistic mood atm, just listening to my Spotify Playlist that I made today.....while writing this. I've been manifesting (not that I believe in it)...but to manifest a mindset, that I can get behind. I ate Mint icecream from Friendly's instead of Chocolate since they messed the order up, nonetheless. I've just been doing a lot that's odd from my normal. I've also been trying to be more open/honest even if I come off as brutal, to questions asked. If it comes to bite me, it bites me.\n\nI said 'No' decently loud at times, to my dad a few times today, because he has the issue where he'll finish or try to finish what I'm trying to say...and that annoys me and hurts me, I still have to properly disclose that, once again....I did today disclose \"finishing my speech is bad,\" but it wasn't taken correctly (my Mom thought it was about her, not in general of the family) when I told her finishing what I'm trying to say is bad.....I think she took it as 'interrupting' instead too, not 'finishing my speech,' which is what I meant.\n\nAnyways, I think I want the change when it comes to committing to talking...it's just I need to be prepared to really put myself out there, and I could....it's just the extreme reaction I'm afraid of in reality. I wish my Family didn't know me or about me.\n\nHopefully tomorrow this mindset grows and this isn't for nothing. I know I've ranted and raved a lot on here, and I guess I sort of feel like I'm doing this for you guys as well. I feel like I want to do it, to prove to myself and more to you, that we can if we really want to. It's never too late.\n\nAnd to just add since I'm writing so much, when I grew up I would LOVE The Sims (Old Callmekevin Sims 3 videos), but when I played it I was disappointed because it's imagination based. It's nothing like real life...in GTA V I wished they would add normal 9-5 Jobs.....I think I've always wanted this normal life, and was stuck in my own world thinking that was what I wanted; in a game, when in reality I wanted it IRL, not in a game........I just want to unlock more in life, and I hope talking will get me there. It's so crazy to think how everyone else has something so crucial to easier success, speech is probably the most powerful thing we have in this world. If you can speak well, you can make it in anyway you think of. That's it for this night's rant...I'll be back don't worry.\n\n**Also I have a question to add to my rant:** What was it like transferring from a few words to more interjecting phrases and sentences to those you couldn't communicate normally with?

I need all the insight I can get, and I just keep thinking. I literally just read the whole Wikipedia page on 'Selective Mutism.'\n\nI have another question again for those who recovered, **How did you start, and how fast/severely did you tackle, battling SM? What was that initial 'f\\*\\*k it' day like, how much progress was made?**\n\n*RANT:*\n\nHonestly I think tomorrow I really want to make a big impact on it and just try to talk the most I have in a long time to my family. Will that happen, idk? A lot changes from the night to the morning. If anything significant does happen, I'll update the post. I hope to be the guy here that can help those who aren't recovered. To me, this is all 'normal,' and it always has been...but at the same time I can't live as normal as others and it bugs me so much, it's so stupid how I can't even talk to my family. It just sounds so dumb. Though I guess that's what this is. It's really that aspect that drives me the most.\n\nAlso it's not that I'm not comfortable now, it's just that I'm missing out in so many ways. I really urge everyone here to think and consider recovery truly. If you caught me a month ago, there was no real care for recovery in my mind...although I knew eventually this would all catch up to me regardless. I just pushed this recovery all off because I thought I didn't care, and in ways I don't but in others I do.\n\nI actually have a cousin who idk if he was/is SM, but in conversation he isn't that assertive, he'll lack the social skills most have, and he was always deemed the 'one that doesn't talk' by relatives. He's 30+ and I feel bad, he's still with his parents and without a job. He's on disability for a supposed 'back injury' from carrying books in HS...he went to college online, and I'm not doubting he could be genuinely injured, though I can't help but think maybe it's just a 'push-away excuse?' And I know this may come off as a jab or insensitive, but to me this is all a serious topic and I'll just share that whole-ly, rather than as a half-truth to avoid that. I wonder if he's unhappy or not? I wouldn't be happy if I was him; not genuinely...I'm not happy with my current life at 18, not whole-heartedly...and when I'm happy, I'll tell you I'm literally on top of the world. Also as far as I'm aware, he's never had a significant other too. He really just has his dogs, along with his parents. \n\nI have to be honest with myself, that's not where I'd want to end up. I mean this is all not an easy thing to overcome, but where does the vision of your life end up? (That vision being nothing off the table, pretend you're the most outgoing and confident person in the world with your goals). And I say this to just see if you do want to recover or not, because I'll see a lot of sugar-coating on this sub in instances and to me I feel like it's not always the way to go. \n\nThanks for the help, this sub has helped.

What event drove you to seriously want the change? \n\nBe as detailed as you want. I am there mentally (I wasn't 1 month ago), but I'm also afraid to commit. I'll die on the inside if I do commit, and in a way I'm more scared of the change...as much as I want the change. I know this is sort of like my last post, but I like the reddit the best to conversate these things, I'm going through old recovered posts just reading them RN.\n\n***Pre-text:*** *\\*I cannot communicate properly with family/extended family....or those that know me as mute....or in the presence of those that I can not talk to.....I can talk to strangers when alone.*\n\nFor me it all changed after meeting this girl, I realized I can't have anything like that in an ideal way unless I change. Before this event, I said I wanted change but really I was never going to actively pursue it, at least not as rapidly as I want to now. I think before meeting that girl, maybe a week before I was starting to breakdown a bit...I actually cried in the Outback for no decipherable reason.......but after meeting her, that's when I really started to breakdown, I would be on the couch laying/crying all day.....eventually telling my Mom some more key things about my SM which she has never realized.  I think it was all coming down to that realization eventually, just maybe not that soon....anyway, that's ranting. I could go on and on.\n\nNow I just browse r/teenagers all day, and this sub...and watch a select few YouTube videos...although I watch ones now that are about bettering yourself, like Ted Talks and stuff....in the past, that was a rare thing for me, but I'll sit through a whole 30minute one at night. \n\nAlso I know you guys probably know my story already, since I post a lot (my last post being the latest on the sub before this one..) but yeah....this is just the best place to discuss anything for me, the discord I don't find it too helpful to discuss SM on. I repeated that, but...thanks. I go now. \n\nAlso I encourage everyone to post more if you can. It's always nice seeing other's insights on everything and anything.

I feel like mentally I have changed significantly since then, it's just in practice I really haven't. I think volume is my next true threshold that I'll start to push to the max. \n\nIt's also in passing conversation I really don't know how to start anything, or have much of an interest in starting anything. It's like I want to be this expressive person but at the same time I don't care to be. I would love to just spill all my thoughts onto my Mom, or tell my Dad I want to get a motorcycle (with my own cash).....I want to start doing things by myself. Although I think when change will truly be made is when I get back to college for the first time in-person, there I will try to express myself at least better because my family is where I have the hard time speaking, to others I am just nervous but I can do it. So maybe it's then?\n\nTonight I definitely had the greatest mindset so far, although going into the night I was uneasy, but after a while my mindset changed back to normal/being better. I feel like I'm at the point where all it takes is to start talking, and that's the crossroads. It's really breaking the barrier and not building the mindset anymore. I'll die on the inside, but maybe that's where I need to die at least for a little while.\n\nAnd for more context, this want for change started after meeting a girl on the 28th, I want to try to pursue her or someone like her in the future/near future (it made me realize what I want out of life)...though again, at the same time that change scares me. Although, I want it at the same time. She's definitely perfect and that's the problem, I can't miss that.

I always felt odd about posting on there, feeling like no one would care about what I said or posted and that they could end up deleting me because seeing something they didn't care about in their newsfeed annoyed them. If I change my profile picture, I always change my settings to \"Only Me\" immediately so no one sees it and thinks I am being vain or that I love myself and want attention. It has been a few years since my last post on Instagram, so I know that if I post, people will get a notification about it. I don't mind when I get those from other people, but I feel as though what is acceptable from other people is unacceptable from me (about many things).\n\nA few years ago, I overheard some strangers having a conversation about a quiet man who never talked much in person, but posted regularly on Facebook. One of the women thought it was strange. This has stuck with me. Before then, I never gave it much thought and hadn't considered that it could be strange of me to sometimes post on Facebook.\n\nBefore hearing that, I didn't post much (mostly photos I took of things other than myself) but often commented on the posts my mum and sisters made. Some people said they enjoyed reading what we said. Now if one of them posts on my timeline, I'll only respond with a like. Thinking about it, this probably looks even stranger than if I was actually posting - people could think I'm being rude and wonder why I didn't reply.\n\nSometimes I miss being able to comment or wish people a happy birthday, but it has been about five or six years, and it feels like if I suddenly start now, it would be weird of me. I'm trying to stop caring so much about what people think of me, and I recently came to the realisation that my cousins truly don't even know me. If I have met them, I was most likely not the only quiet one, and they might not even remember that I didn't speak. I am sure of it that some relatives would have said horrible things about me behind my back, as I have witnessed them do this to other relatives. This doesn't help me feel better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else feel like they're \"not allowed\" to post on social media?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5165, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Uncomfortable on Social Media", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/oq4rd7/uncomfortable_on_social_media/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "emmy_jemmy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5noowpqp", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626862914, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/oon272/would_my_experience_be_considered_selective_mutism/", "gildings": {}, "id": "oon272", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/oon272/would_my_experience_be_considered_selective_mutism/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1626862925, "score": 1, "selftext": "I [19F] have been dating my boyfriend [20M] for almost 4 years now.

People used to say to me, \"oh you must just be shy or afraid to talk...\" but that shoe never really fit. My brain simply doesn't produce anything that translates into spontaneous \"talk.\" \n\nI have NO problem conversing if it's relevant to one of my special interests. But a lot of NT conversation is popcorn style and random... and that is the cue for my brain to say, \"I'm on my coffee break\" with regard to conversing.

I feel like I can be more spunky and careless but also extremely sensitive.\n\nI remember in hs my best friends sisters best friend talked bad abt her and I heard. I remember my best friend told her sister someone was talking shit abt her and I heard. She laughed and said \u201cwho\u201d in a careless way bc obviosult she wouldn\u2019t care if it was a stranger.

Idk I was ok w being mean to her but it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t know I was doing this. I remember in hs I was generally nice but did for some reason enjoy mocking or just making fun of strangers online probably bc other kids in my grade did.

I don't know if I definitely have selective mutism, but sometimes I just get so nervous (not even at anything in particular) and clam up, completely unable to say a word, and I can't open up until I feel a bit better.\n\nJust yesterday, my entire college year found out that someone tested positive for Covid-19, so we all have to self-isolate for 10 days. A lot of my trauma stems from being isolated away from everyone, so of course, I feel more nervous and thus I have clammed up a bit more.\n\nI have a favourite teacher that I message whenever I have queries when I can't talk with him face-to-face, but recently I've noticed that he's not responding to me as often, even when the message contains important information or I've asked a question that definitely warrants a response.

I'm turning 28 in a few months, and I've basically given up on society as a selectively mute teenager... until now. I've been going through a brain rewiring experience recently and it is all thanks to music.\n\nI used to feel almost wickedly proud for hiding from people and being immune to loneliness, but now... I'm longing to express myself, make friends, and give taking part of society and stepping outside a try. But the problem is that I'm afraid and completely clueless on how to start. It feels like my mind has not socially grown past that of a teenager's. I've become an extreme shut-in with absolutely no experience with how society works.\n\nI had plenty of help and opportunities chucked at me as an extremely stubborn teenager, but now as a remorseful adult, I can't help but feel like a forgotten lost cause of a human being. There's no one around to push me and help me get out of my comfort zone. How I wish to turn back time!\n\nI attempted therapy some years ago, but the therapist was completely heartless. She worked on her computer as I sat there waiting for her to say something. This experience started this forgotten lost cause feeling that I have.\n\nBut now with the thought of playing music, I have gained some newfound courage once more. I'm willing to talk and show emotion more than ever now. There are so many things that I want to do (get my GED, meet people, get started on a career, get some health concerns checked out, perhaps join a band), but my uncultured mind and the tightened knots around my mouth seem like so much to try and fix and undo.\n\nHow can I start with life?

I think the problem is not enough people are familiar with it but it is a very serious mental illness and a very different approach should be taken.

I\u2019m a really sensitive person so I had a lot of repressed anger inside of me because of everything which now I guess had a positive because it was because of all that and all the years I had to suffer constantly that I had the courage to step up for myself, and do that for myself no one else and do it because I was tired not because anyone pushed me to but because I knew I could not go another seven years like that and I would not do that to myself regardless of anyone which was actually VERY difficult at first but it\u2019s not something i would ever regret I really really made an effort to talk on the first day of secondary school and I kind of surprised myself aswell because I realised I smile a lot when I talk even now I\u2019m a really smiley person irl I see myself as someone\u2019s who\u2019s approachable and friendly!! I was still labelled the shy type for a few more years eventhough I really started to speak but it happened slowly and over time until I was able to talk at school so much more actually my friend at that time probably doesn\u2019t remember but once she told me I talk a lot which honestly is one of the best compliments I\u2019ve ever gotten in my life because I never used to talk at all. After a while I realised I really like and enjoy talking to people in person a lot and I feel like I can be myself I can say doing that has been one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done in my life I remember spending the whole summer leading up to that year worrying about what to say how to act how to present myself etc because this was my opportunity for change of course I was still quiet in the beginning but I got better. To be able to actually come to that point myself with no one\u2019s help and make that kind of life for myself is amazing really it\u2019s funny now because I have different problems and I go through different life experiences I still struggle with a generalised anxiety disorder and just got out of a really difficult episode I\u2019m actually in an argument with one of my friends currently which is funny because I never thought I would be in this position I feel free in expressing myself I don\u2019t hide anything now life has it\u2019s struggles but I think the love I\u2019ve received from a lot of people whether that be online or in person and more so the ability to love is what has made me so much more confident and that could be a comfort person or a character for you that you love. I definitely am happier now life feels more beautiful and your life is worth living, anyways I\u2019m only posting this here in hopes to at least comfort one person I\u2019ve never actually been to a therapist before but I do recommend it but make sure they specialise in SM and know that you have my compassion, my kindness, my support and my empathy this is your life and you\u2019re doing amazing you\u2019re special embrace it and do not let anyone make you think this is something that you can just get over it is not and if they do they are very insensitive and also very wrong no one deserves to go through this. Sending lots of love I wish I could help all of you one by one your pace is the only one that matters you deserve to be here", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5102, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I used to have selective mutism", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/odcvuz/i_used_to_have_selective_mutism/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "BlackRose712004", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4s79ikqy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1625164620, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/obs5mb/wish_i_had_more_friends/", "gildings": {}, "id": "obs5mb", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2efe4224-937f-11e9-9b3a-0e7080e6db1c", "link_flair_text": "General Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/obs5mb/wish_i_had_more_friends/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1625164631, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5089, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Wish I had more friends :(", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/obs5mb/wish_i_had_more_friends/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "WATCH-ANDI-MACK-", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_37x5wdqj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1625107772, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/obclg7/writing_a_character_with_a_kinda_interesting_case/", "gildings": {}, "id": "obclg7", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "346468e2-937f-11e9-82f2-0eccdc050e9e", "link_flair_text": "Help", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/obclg7/writing_a_character_with_a_kinda_interesting_case/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1625107784, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi so I'm writing a character with selective mutism she's a good friend doing of the main characters. \n\nShe's 21 a model and pretty big in the public eye. \n\nShe will talk to family close friends and her dance group(that of which the main character is a part of)\n\nOutside of that she pretty much shuts down. due to her hectic life of business travel (the group is American she's from germany) and parents who were very busy  She's never really been treated at all.\n\nDue to this The main way she talks is through a text speech app and things like that on her phone.

He then went \"I just can't do this session like this.\" and said we had to end the session, which made me so overwhelmed I had a bad anxiety attack and started crying, because I really did want to talk and tried my best to talk as loud as I could, but he kept insisting he couldn't do this even though I was trying to talk to him (he later called my crying being \"sensitive\")\n\nLuckily I had a pre-written note that explained SM and basically my history throughout the years. So I handed it to him and after reading over it, he says that SM is not a diagnosable condition????? He said its some behavioural thing but cannot be diagnosed?? Boi, if thats the case then why is it LITERALLY in the DSM-5??? ITS DIAGNOSABLE!! \n\nHe then insisted that I had GAD instead. Thats it. No advice on how to handle my anxiety, no meds, no tips, didnt even write it down, no ANYTHING. My dad came in the room after and asked him for some advice like \"well what can we do? How should she practice talking?\" and he just says \"sorry I cant do anything. She has to fix herself first\". Like okay, even if u dont know about SM you could at least give me advice on how to handle my anxiety if I had GAD?? He didn't offer even ONE ATOM of advice for my anxiety.\n\nHe then says to come back in September when *I'm* ready to talk, and that I HAVE TO MAKE THE PHONE CALL TO HIM MYSELF (INSTEAD OF MY PARENTS CALLING)?? Like sheesh I'm here because I CANT DO THAT AND I NEED HELP TALKING!!!! I just don't understand him!!\n\nAlso he didn't refer me to someone else either because \"nobody can treat me if I keep acting like this\"", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5081, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Bad experience with a psychiatrist", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/oaho98/bad_experience_with_a_psychiatrist/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mr_darker", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_116iuq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1624959399, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/oa4wk0/how_do_you_fight_sm_and_go_outta_the_comfort_zone/", "gildings": {}, "id": "oa4wk0", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2efe4224-937f-11e9-9b3a-0e7080e6db1c", "link_flair_text": "General Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/oa4wk0/how_do_you_fight_sm_and_go_outta_the_comfort_zone/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1624959409, "score": 1, "selftext": "This kinda just turned into me writing a buncha stories, but I feel it's kinda interesting. I've not gotten therapy/treatment. I'm 26, male.  I've spent a long time trying to work on things myself. Therapy is on the agenda though. I may have ADHD and part of this was written intoxicated, so... sorry.\n\nI joined the national guard when I was 17. I thought it'd help force me to be talkative (not yet aware its SM). Instead I learned that it's moreso expression of personality that is hardest for me, rather than talking in general. The military rejects individuality in its functional/formal design, so I made it 6 years. It wasn't the prettiest 6 years, I didn't make a single friend despite them all trying to force it to happen, and me not trying to resist. I could recite the soldiers creed &amp; communicate in few words that are strictly business, no interpersonal communication. I had a lot of anxiety, the worst moment was graduation from basically training. My family &amp; girl-interest was there, and we had to one-by-one stand center stage and scream our name and city as loud as possible. Immediately after, you go and shake the hands of high ranking genesis and officers, one of them gave me a funny look and asked if I'm doing alright. I must have had had so much anxiety that I seemed like I was on something. But I did it.\n\nA weird thing is they brought a panda head in the barracks one time, and I popped it on. Suddenly I could roam around and kinda joke physically. I wasn't 100% free of Anxiety's inhibitions so the farthest I could take it is walking outside of the barracks to a humvee. I didn't like it, being unable to do anything but walk with it, it just felt like a weird form of attention seeking, which I don't want lol. It brings anxiety. But something about that panda head seemed positive like it was an improvement. Others thought so too. I remember a guy saying \"look at you! We should a got you that panda head years ago!\". I think he caught me smiling, thats when he said that.\n\n\nNowadays, I'm a mime. I haven't practiced any performances yet, not sure I even want to. But, I got into face paint, and always sorta joked that I should just be a mime. So I finally dressed up as one with a beret and white striped shirt from hot topic. I like goth stuff and horror, so I already had black pants \ud83d\ude0e I loved how creepy it looks, and, it finally dawned on me that this is my spirit animal, or gender. I did a gender reveal snap story post \ud83e\udd23 snapchat stories are like a little window that I use for others to peer into my unrestricted personality a little. I recently started inviting strangers to my snapchat to see if it helps or hurts my case with trying to make friends \ud83e\udd23\n\nThe mime though. It actually seems to relieve more anxiety than it brings when I wear it in social settings, or at least switch up the kind of anxiety experienced. One of my biggest fears/anxious-worries when unable to fully talk, is a fear of coming across as rude or failing to be friendly. I used to HATE part of a job I had that involved walking through a nursing home because I love old people so much \ud83e\udd7a And all I can do is come off as cold and uninterested, which can be bad at times. Some of them always try to talk too. But, fears like this in public, aren't a worry when you're a mime. On sight, people know you're not saying a word. i mean I do, I'm usually with friends. I'm usually intoxicated when I'm a mime too, so keep that in mind.\nAll the times you meet new people and they wonder why youre so quiet or why youre not talking, the mime paint explains it, or at least gives them am explanation. It probably adds a bit of a puzzling element to what they see too, it's not something you see every day. At the same time theres negative attention in some situations like I dressed in a neon track suit for a riff raff show with 4 others, also in my mime facepaint. Some members of the crowd seemed a bit rude (sensitive people would be offended), others were supportive. I made the mistake of getting too intoxicated before the show and realized I was in the middle of murderappolis drawing a lot of attention to myself, too intoxicated to tell whats going on, unarmed, and not able to defend against any negative attention that came my way. I didnt like it. But I got a great pic with riff raff. I felt the best pose I could do under anxiety's suppression was the absence of any pose, just natural emotionless stare. The lighting hit my face just perfect, I look creepy and I love it. It goes with the facepaint as a horror theme \ud83d\ude01 Fuckin nailed it *self hi five* I had anxiety over that photo for over a month.\n\nI like the mime paint because it makes visible, what is invisible, a set of rules we're bound by. It's hard to break character.\nWe are mimes, trapped in our invisible boxes, invisible sanitariums (\"leave me be\").\nNobody sees the invisible box.\nWe are restrained within the box, invisible straight jackets, invisible gags, our personalities locked up tight.\nThe box appears when around others, few if any have ever joined us within the box.\nOur personalities are free when alone.\n\n\nThe selective part for me has been family in the past but switched to girlfriends. Thanks to online dating, and some people having patience with others thinking theyre just shy, I've had about 8 years of bad relationships (im told ive had bad luck) and a codependant (by design) situation. Life has steadily gone downhill over the years, and I'm at a point where I aim to not jump into another bad relationship, stop overworking, and focus on myself. Learning to enjoy life and have fun, self care, and trying to make friends. Girlfriends kinda make you happy and forget you even got shit wrong with you, and its nice having someone you can talk to and be yourself with. But friends seem like a way better investment of time and efforts. Compared to always starting back at zero after each relationship.\n\nI feel like I've lost the ability to hold conversations online, if I ever had that ability. All I seem to be able to do is write massive paragraphs nobody wants to read. Plus women nowdays gotta be so cautious with guys its hard to really figure out how to connect. Especially now while intentionally posing as a creepy mime and looking like a real life joker movie lol. It doesnt follow social norms, but I dont really care \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Nor do I wanna talk to people who go by social norms. Have some originality ya ho \ud83d\ude44\n\nI bought a bunch of camping gear to travel solo in. I struggle with reliable employment/income so don't know for sure if I can make it happen in the future. So, I invest in keeping my ongoing expenses as low as possible. I splurge when I got money and scraped by when I don't. The tent setup, in theory (haven't practiced yet) allows me to live off grid, solo dispersed camping. Its free in national Forrest. I intend to travel that way. Solo travel is supposed to be good for you. Traveling in general sounds nice. As does alone time, I can be me and self discover who I am and all that  alone. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I also hope to make bigger dents in the walls of the invisible box with friends. They're fine with me being a fly on the wall at social stuff with them. I know them through a friend I retained from kindergarden.\n\nThere's beach fires, where I took note that people play campfire songs. I kinda play guitar, and if I can practice songs enough to perform, that's a way I could participate without speaking. I get anxiety over playing, I can rarely play in front of others, but, it seems like I can play when I've practiced and know for sure I have the song down. That's performance anxiety, not inhibitions/restrictions. Oddly enough, I feel as if this is true for singing too, except that'd be a lot harder \ud83d\ude05\n\nThere's concerts. I want to learn to dance, I never have. Some concerts you'd dance in the crowd a little at though. I watched one of my friends dance and it was really cool like she just looked as if she was in her own happy world. (Dancing Queen). Sometimes all I can do is stand there cross armed not even able to smile. Other times I was jumping with the crowd and feeling the beat ^_^ not fully but its progress. I experiment with intoxication at shows though so idk if I have any logically concluded findings to share. The best experience I'd say was Northern Invasion when I saw Tool. There were maybe 4 or 5 people in front of me, thats how close I was. At any poi t in time you had at least 5 people in contact with you, as well as crowdsurfers tumbling above. The crowd moved like a wave, you could almost pick ypur feet up off the ground and still be carried 10 feet in this direction with the crowd as one giant solid mass, then back this way, like an ocean of bodies, sweat in the air, tool playin nearby, it was great.\n\nThen there's bars. Pool is a solid thing, darts is more anxiety producing. Ordering drinks is difficult and anxiety producing. I don't order so feel like its a whole different language without a menu to even help you out. Peach crown royal &amp; dr pepper is a solid default order i know im ok with and just recently memorized. My panic/say-something-now order is jack &amp; coke, fireball, or jaegermeister because I know I can drink those. For beers i know im ok with busch light, angry orchard ciders, golden light, all the beers my friend shakes his head at, I can tolerate.\nIt can be kinda depressing going in bars and just seeing everyone else talking and having fun, and being unable to participate in any of that. Especially when your friends (who don't accompany you in the invisible box, or really understand it) are all talking too and they invite you to talk with them. It just brings to your attention the invitation/tease, and the reminder that you can't, and can trigger downward spirals about how much of a curse it is being stuck in the box. BUT, it can be okay too. I go out mainly to try and be as social as possible, and seek improvement in my life wherever I possibly can.\n\nI've only been to a stripclub once so far. It wasn't planned, and was more anxiety than I thought. My back was kinda turned to the stage, I felt put of place (as I used to at bars initially), worse, my friends were all urging me to start throwing dollars at the strippers or get a lap dance, and being loud about it. One of them finally had the thought to approach it right and bought me a lap dance, which was really awkward like im gonna creep this stripper out not talking, what do i do with myself or my hands or face, oh my god. It was a no touch dance so she instructed where to sit and put my hands, and from there you do nothing. its kinda embarassingly awkward when theres boobs in your face and youre just awkwardly nonreactive xD but it was pretty cool. Also, intimacy seems to unlock inhibitions with girlfriends, or play a part in it. There was a massive relief of anxiety after the lap dance. I could look at the strippers and people around there (in the eye if appropriate), and it was a nice vibe. beautiful women everywhere, everyones happy, even the strippers. cool music, cool lighting, and theres a bar in there, I had no idea how nice itd be in there. If I wasn't worried about money, I'd probably be going there solo to work on fighting anxiety there while enjoying it. I imagine getting used to interacting with them might help with interacting with dates \ud83d\ude06  Be warned, they approach you and try to talk a bit before inviting you to a lap dance.

It's for grades 4-12 and this is the last year I am able to go. Problem is that I know I most likely won't be able to talk or make friends. It's even more challenging to when you consider that most people will bring their friends from school, and I'll probably be left out of everything. These kind of camps are usually torture if you're alone and just awkwardly present.\n\n\nI remember going to this camp when I was in 4th grade. I talked to absolutly no one, made no friends, dreded everyday of it, and wanted to go home. I could barely eat any food and didn't really participate in any of the games. The cabin leaders encouraged me to join in the activities but I couldn't no matter how much I tired. I watched as other people made memories, while I stayed alone even though I wanted to talk and make friends so badly. I was always exhausted and just felt like crying all the time when I was there. It was easily the longest time I've gone without talking. When my parents picked me up I was happy it was over, but also extremely angry and sad that I didn't talk to anyone. I ended up crying in my room, and never told my parents about the awful time I had. Now I'm fearful that I will relive that experience, especially because I haven't been in a social situation like school since covid started.\n\nThe only reason I'm even considering going is because of the infinitesimal chance that I'll talk to people and have fun. There were actually a few instances when I managed to make friends at summer camps (Not sleep-away camps) when I was in elementary school. But it only happened twice, which is barely anything considering that my parents put me in a ton of new camps every week of every summer. That was a loooooonnnnggg time ago, and now that I'm older it's definity gotten even harder to talk to people. I can't even speak at school even though I attended in person for 2 years.\n\nI Guess what I'm asking is what would you guys do in my situation? Should I go to the sleep-away camp where I will most likely not speak at all, and suffer for 5 straight days and nights? There is still an infinitesimally small chance that I MIGHT have fun if I make a friend, so that's my only hope. Or I could just stay home and not need to suffer at all. If I don't go, I will still have some social opportunities when highschool resumes.

"score": 12, "selftext": "i absolutely hate self diagnosing myself because of the large amount of people that romanticize mental health disorders but i have to be real with myself.\n\n im a 15 year old male. ive always been a very very very very quiet kid. super quiet. literally thats the first thing people say when describing me. in every single report card since 2nd grade teachers would always write \"quiet\" \"doesnt speak much\" \"does not participate\" etc. in school i would not say a word all day and not even realize until someone pointed it out. although i am shy, that wasnt the only reason for my behavior, i just didnt feel that \"need\" to socialize and was more comfortable in my own thoughts. id feel embarrassed when someone would speak to me but id still reply. at home, i indeed did speak more. id make weird noises and say random things just because. i definitely didnt do things like that in school and id annoy my immediate family a lot, maybe i was making up for the little to none social interaction i had in school. that shouldve been a red flag but nothing was done. now regarding my experience in MIDDLE school, oh my god.\n\n im not even trying to boast or anything but i was in the top 3 quietest students. i for sure developed selective mutism. this was before i knew anything about mental health so i know its real and im not just \"faking\" it. if the teacher asked a question to the whole class, and picked me cause i never raised my hand, id just shrug and not say a word until she moved on to the next person. for general questions from my teachers and students, if it was a yes or no question, id just nod or shake my head. if it required me to speak, id shrug and look down until they left me alone. in group work, i would not say a word even if that meant i would get trouble. its not that i wanted to be rude and rebellious or anything, i just couldnt get the words out of my mouth for the life of me. sometimes i DID have something to say but there was just this lump in my throat that wouldnt allow me to say anything. id take the yelling, screaming, phone calls to my parents, rather than speaking. when we'd do projects that we'd have to present in front of the class, sometimes i wouldnt even do the project just to avoid presenting in front of the class. and if i did do it, i wouldnt stand up when it was my turn to present. the teacher would ask like ten times and i still wouldnt. the whole class would stare at me but at this point i was taking all embarrassment and punishments if that would mean i didnt have to speak, after begging me, the teacher would just send me to the school counselor. i was known as the \"quiet kid\" and \"the kid that doesnt do any work\". i knew this kid that i got along with and now i realize he probably had selective mutism too. he'd get yelled at for not speaking by teachers and would cry in class, he'd show signs of anxiety aswell and i could just tell he was going through the same thing i was so thats why i befriended him. again im not trying to brag but me and him were the only ones who were like this in the entire school. i knew something was wrong with me. eventually the school forced me to do therapy but that didnt work because you know.. selective mutism. then covid came i was so relieved. i did two years of school remotely and spoke to no one besides my mom, dad, and sister for a year and a half.\n\ni realize that im damaging myself and this couldve prevented by numerous ways by my school, parents, and myself but guess what i still have it. during mid-quarantine i thought my social anxiety was getting better as i havent felt the way i did in school for a while. i now realize that it hasnt and i havent felt that feeling of anxiety in a while because i never left the house or spoke to anyone besides people at my home. i am certain that i had it at one point but as of now im not sure because i dont encounter situations where i have to socialize with people i dont know very often. i still need my mom to speak for me in situations like ordering food or encountering other family members. i avoid family reunions and when im told to go the park to get some sunlight i just hide somewhere close to my home. i know im damaging myself but regardless i still have very very bad social anxiety. i havent had a friend in a few years. in a few weeks im gonna go back to regular classes and im scared because my anxiety probably got 10 times worse. i also feel like i getting diagnosed just gives an excuse behavior for certain mental health issues, depression being the most common. some people just need that kick to start their engine. i know theyre different things regardless i feel like if i get diagnosed its just like \"yep u got problems, ur not capable and u can use this as an excuse for your failure\"\n\nso a few questions: \n\nis this selective mutism?\n\nwhats the point of diagnosement? should i get diagnosed? and if so, how?\n\nis it wrong for me to claim i have selective mutism even if i haven't been diagnosed?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw",

I\u2019ve been going steady with my girlfriend for a while now. We are long distance and our main form of communication is via text. Just to preface, I feel really happy with her and I love her a lot!\n\nI honestly didn\u2019t know anything about SM when I started dating her, and I have some questions about it that I don\u2019t know where else to ask. I know none of you would be able to answer for her, so I\u2019ll just ask for your own perspective on things.\n\n1. For anyone in a relationship/deep friendship, how long did it take for you to be fully comfortable speaking to your partner, if ever? \n2. How hard is it to do so? \n3. What helps you the most in situations like that?\n4. Do you have any advice on how to feel closer to her, even with the distance and mutism? \n5. Does anyone else find it difficult to date someone with SM, and what do you do to remedy this feeling?\n\nI want to understand her more. Personally, I am a very talkative person and talking to her even when she can\u2019t makes me happy. Something I find enjoyable is when both of us are on call and she stays unmuted even though she isn\u2019t talking; it sounds kinda weird but being able to hear her type and do her breathy laugh when I say something funny helps me feel closer to her, which is always my goal.\n\nThere are times where it feels particularly tough to go on. I wouldn\u2019t really consider myself to be the most extroverted person on earth, but talking verbally is something I like doing and want to do with her. However, I know what feels difficult for me must hurt her tenfold. She puts in a lot of effort just for me, which has prompted me to do my own research and try to understand her more deeply. \n\nIf anyone can answer, it is greatly appreciated! I\u2019m looking for your own experiences or opinions on this matter / relationships with having SM in general. :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit":

At this time my dad was getting really angry that I was starting to stop being able to speak to family, and starting shouting at me, threatening to throw me out of the car unless I spoke (would've been a 7 mile walk home) but I managed to say something. Obviously this just made me even worse, my parents realised that this wasnt working so they gave me space and eventually I was able to start talking to then again and I thought I was getting better up until late last year when I started a new school (I'm now 16). Not many of my friends who I was comfortable talking to changed school with me, and most of those who did started drifting apart so I was forced to either be alone or make new friends, which is very difficult for me. I managed to make about 2 friends somehow (if I start small with stuff like answering somebody's question I can sometimes force myself to become comfortable with them) but still I was spending most of my time completely alone, and I was starting to get suicidal thoughts seeing as it isnt possible for me to make friends, and at this point I hadn't spoken to anyone in ages, but occasionally I'd see some of my old friends on the train, which would make me excited at first until I realized that I couldn't talk to them. When I had to do something such as a school trip where I'd have to talk to people I'd start to feel really sick, to the point where I'd be on the toilet for hours. This brought back the suicidal thoughts and made things so much worse. I couldn't talk to old friends, I couldn't make new friends, I couldn't tell my family about it, I can't tell my own mother that i love her, my brain just wont allow me to, i cant swear, there's a whole list of seemingly insignificant words that I cant say, I have no way of getting help as I'm unable to ask.

I know this is quite long, but I think it\u2019s definitely worth reading for anyone who has SM or social anxiety in general because I share some of my insights in here that I\u2019ve thought about for years of living with both of these things.\n\nSo I don\u2019t have a diagnosis of selective mutism but my mom is a psychologist and has known I have had SM since the age of 4. She decided not to get me diagnosed, due to her belief of disorders and the human brain being very fluid and changeable especially while you\u2019re young and she didn\u2019t want me it negatively affect my life or stop be from being able to do things.\nI showed signs from the age of 4 and apparently would burst into tears whenever exposed to situations I found uncomfortable which is a clear sign of struggle to regulate my emotions.\n\nNow, I can regulate my emotions for the most part and selective mutism usually effects me at school, in lessons. I\u2019m now almost 18 years old and have never ever raised my hand in class; I never volunteer to answer questions. Luckily, when a teachers picks on me to answer a question I can usually give a short answer but it fills me with extreme anxiety and never gets easier.\nWhenever I\u2019m in group situations where I don\u2019t know or am not good friends with every single person, I am in constant fight or flight mode causing me to practically feel frozen and just completely uncomfortable - unable to initiate any conversation. Another example of this is when I went on a week long class trip to the UK when I was still relatively new to the school and actually knew nobody on the trip. I had to sit in car for 5 hour journeys every day full of all my classmates who felt like strangers, just chatting to each other. I didn\u2019t say a word to any of them for an entire week. I felt embarrassed because I was so conscious of what they might be thinking of me as I wasn\u2019t engaging in conversation with them. Self consciousness is something I often deal with as part of a separate social anxiety problem - which exasperates the struggle of SM. \nBecause of probably only saying 2 words the whole week, and only to the teachers, my throat had become so dry and voice lost its projection. I couldn\u2019t even speak properly or at a normal volume to my parents when I finally returned home and they say my face had no emotion and I almost seemed dead inside. I also noticed that I\u2019d been surviving the whole week of the trip purely on adrenaline and ended up sleeping for like 2 days straight to regain energy when I got home.\n\n I hate having SM because despite the anxiety I am actually someone who has a lot to say, and absolutely loves socialising which makes it every harder not feeling able to. I wouldn\u2019t consider myself an extrovert because socialising still drains me more than it gives me energy, but it\u2019s definitely something I enjoy. \nI also suffer with OCD, which as a disorder, is very linked to SM, because the whole idea of SM is controlling your anxiety by choosing not to speak, and once that habit is formed and the fear is fed even more it begins to really feel like you cannot physically speak. \n\nFor me, everything in my body language appears confident to others, as I, without thinking, laugh during group discussions, and use facial expressions... basically everything except for my voice. I notice that many people are confused by me as I appear as someone who they know is able to speak but for some reason doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s often confused with being shy, which for me is such an arbitrary word which I don\u2019t know whether to associate with or not but I do know that when in large and unfamiliar groups, I\u2019m in a constant internal state of anxiety and general discomfort. Because I don\u2019t have any diagnosis, none of my teachers have ever understood why I\u2019m always silent in their classes because even a shy person would warm up to the environment and begin to progressively speak more and be themselves. Whereas I consistently have remained silent for almost 13 school years and have never been able to be myself. This upsets me as I wish I could\u2019ve been able to make the most of my school life rather than daily counting down until the end of class as soon as I enter a classroom. \nMy perspective on this is that crazily school seeks to be the one place that is perfectly made to have maximum anxiety potential for children with anxiety in general but especially SM. Imagine spending the whole day hopping from class to class which for people with SM targets their weakness of talking. It  makes for a very \u201csilent\u201d day, every day.\nThe only times when I feel I can be myself is when I\u2019m alone with my family or friends. It\u2019s frustrating when I can see that the teacher is confused as to whether I\u2019m shy, disobedient, confused about the school work... some people have even questioned if I\u2019m depressed! \n\nAnyway, I just thought I\u2019d share my struggles with SM and I wonder if anyone can relate to some of the things I said?\ud83d\ude0c", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3490, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My struggle with SM (who can relate?)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/i06d6n/my_struggle_with_sm_who_can_relate/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "peapod321", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_73uio9hy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1596020797, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/hzysnw/thank_you/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hzysnw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2efe4224-937f-11e9-9b3a-0e7080e6db1c", "link_flair_text": "General Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/hzysnw/thank_you/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1596020809, "score": 1, "selftext": "I had a relationship with someone with SM for a few years.

I was always very chatty at home with my parents and when I spoke to a couple of friends outside of school. But I was never completely mute and feel like i'm fairly functional now.\n\nIn school I could speak when asked a direct question with a short sentence or two. And could talk one on one to a handful of people. In groups I felt like I couldn't speak  i.e. in the play ground I would just stand and listen sometimes smile and occasionally laugh. It wouldn't be unusual if I spoke maybe 30 seconds over several school days certain at periods. \n\nIn later years I would be able to give short presentations with others but I mainly just joked about how bad my presentation part was. I don't think I ever asked a question in class until 17-18. \n\nI wasn't able to take the bus until I was about 17 I would walk an hour and half instead of getting a 30 minute bus when I had too. I wouldn't be able to buy stuff at shops either. Later on I would skip lunch and avoid people as I felt friends were only hanging out with out of pity and felt like I was lowering  their social standing. I've never asked for directions from strangers. I didn't have any friends on my course at uni until 4th year but made good friends with my housemates. Telephone calls sometimes still freak me out. I have to take a few minutes of deep breathing to talk to clients at work I haven't spoken to before. And I haven't been able to book any hospital appointments despite logically knowing I should.\n\nReading about this yesterday has started to make a lot of sense of why I've never had a girlfriend and why I've always felt different and absence in group situations . For a long time I thought I was just stupid and lazy.\n\nSorry this became a unorganized spew of consciousness. It feels good to share my thoughts anonymously.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3475,

I don\u2019t even know if I truly have SM but moments like these really seem to make me think I do. My dad for some reason was adamant that me and my brothers solve this trigonometry problem. He called us all to come and go through the problem with him. He asked us a really simple question about what an angle\u2019s measurement was and none of us said anything. It was like simple basic trig yet I didn\u2019t say anything cause of this stupid SM. And for some reason my brothers didn\u2019t say anything either. I don\u2019t think they have SM, they talk way more than I do (though that\u2019s not saying much) but they just didn\u2019t care enough to answer probably. So my dad took everyone\u2019s silence as \u201cwe don\u2019t know the answer.\u201d He just fucking assumes we\u2019re all idiots because we\u2019re silent. It never crosses his mind that we just don\u2019t want to answer, or in my case that I can\u2019t answer. So then he starts getting frustrated that we don\u2019t know and then walks away for a minute. I take that time to write the down answer so I can show him when he comes back. But when I show him for some reason he demands that I explain how I got it. I couldn\u2019t thanks to my SM, and my brothers were standing around silently which only further triggers my mutism, and he took the pencil so I couldn\u2019t write down the explanation to show him. So I just stood there silently as he went off on this rant about \u201cwow I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t know such a simple problem, how do you expect to go to college and pursue sciences if you don\u2019t know this\u201d despite the fact that I DO fucking know. I literally wrote the answer right there but he just didn\u2019t believe I knew how to get it without me explaining it verbally. And then when I walked away I heard him ranting to my mom about \u201cI can\u2019t believe it what are they teaching kids these days\u201d. I just fucking hate people like my dad who just absolutely require that you give them verbal confirmation to understand something. I\u2019m not an idiot (or at least not academically) but I\u2019m really bad at speaking, but to people like my dad there\u2019s apparently no fucking difference. \n\nAnd maybe this sounds silly to others to get upset about, but I\u2019ve always been insecure about the fact that I\u2019m quiet and socially inept. People look down on me for that and treat me like a little child. The only thing I have to my name that gives me even the slightest bit of dignity is intellect, so moments like these where people see me as stupid really hit hard for me cause at that point there\u2019s nothing respectable about me and I might as well just be a tiny helpless baby to them. I just wish people could respect other\u2019s limitations and not expect them to be perfect at everything and not judge them entirely based on their ability to talk.

Also when I was in kindergarten, if I wanted help (for example someone to tie my shoes) I wouldn't ask for help and stay in my place and start crying silently, also when I wanted to go to the bathroom. I really liked learning in kindergarten but I started hating going because I would face situations where I needed to talk and ask for help. Around my family, I was at first always laughing and happy kid but after I got into primary school, I became more and more mute around my family too. Like I could speak superficially and briefly with them but that's all. If I am having a problem, I would try to solve it myself and never ask for help even if I really needed help. When teachers spoke to me, I would act like I didn't hear them just so I avoid interacting with them. Ohh and when they send me to bring them something from another class, I literally start crying in my way to the other class. \n\nNow, as a grown up, I am much better tbh, I no longer have that fear I used to have, but I still talk superficially to most people. Like my thoughts are deep and I think about topics for long, but I just can't speak to someone who I think won't get it or when I don't feel comfortable. I have like 3 good friends and I can be very cheerful and talkative around them and they like me and I like them a lot. And we can speak deeply about any topic. But they are very few and I am tirrred of this. Like I want to be able to speak to anyone I want like I do with my good friends and be myself with everyone but words fail me everytime. \n\nIt reached a point when I wanted badly to break from this bubble so I started searching up what's wrong with me and here I am.

I never pressure him to speak and I always remind him when he\u2019s ready he can speak to me but sometimes it still hurts that he\u2019s not comfortable enough to talk to me yet. \n\nHe speaks to his mom and his dad and his ex but that\u2019s about it.

I get really sweaty, get panic but I really can\u2019t get a single word out.\n\nSo I did some research about how SM comes in affect. It is part of social anxiety, where the amygdala(part of the brain responsible for the recognition of danger and how to deal with it) considers social encounters as a threat. To fight this thread the amygdala applies actions that helped in the past. In case of SM, staying silent helped. So the amygdala blocks the function of the verbal cortex. Wich makes, in certain situations, someone with SM even more mute than someone with none working vocal cords (:\n\nSo my conclusion is that SM can come in effect  when encountering one specific person.\n\nIf i am wrong with my definition please correct me.

I learned about selective mutism when I was 14, after googling \"social anxiety\", which I'd heard about on TV. I talked to my parents about it, but they were abusive and neglecting and a huge trigger for my failure to speak so nothing ever came of that conversation. I was never diagnosed or treated and only overcame my failure to reliably hold basic conversations with others when I was an adult. Starting at that age of 14, whenever I wasn't in denial that I had a problem I blamed selective mutism for my inability to talk, but recently, I read about another explanation.\n\nI read and highly recommend a book called The Body Keeps the Score. The author talks about a trauma patient, a girl born to an addict mother, who is neglected and abused as a child and eventually ends up in foster care, who overcomes a total lack of communication with people around her, including social workers and therapists, thorough a relationship with a horse. That feels like a bad way of putting it but I can't think of another way of succinctly saying it. The author never mentions selective mutism, but he goes on to talk about other patients who lose their voice due to trauma. He talks about refugees who survive war, genocide, literal atrocities, who reveal details of traumatic events in conversations with him but are struck dumb in conversations with judges who will decide whether they receive asylum or can safely go back to their countries. Because of their inability to convey that they will risk their lives if they go back to their war torn countries, they are denied it. He also mentions Broca's area and how it's responsible for language, but shuts down when a person goes into fight or flight mode.\n\nI  wanted to talk about other issues I had as a kid and teen that co-existed along with my lack of speech that this book also provides an explanation for. I know that others in this sub have shared stories of struggling with the same, so hopefully you pick up TBKTS and see if you identify with even more of what it covers. The other issues were poor academic performance and hygiene issues. Starting when I was very little I struggled badly in these areas and I could not figure out why I was like that, until TBKTS gave me insight into it. I think my lack of speech, lack of showering/changing clothes, and poor school performance were manifestations of a trauma \"[freeze](https://lifecentre.uk.com/information-and-resources/dealing-effects-rapesexual-abuse/freeze-response/)\" response. I could not comprehend the abuse and neglect around me and my automatic unconscious reaction was no reaction at all. I often slept my anxiety away. My history of being unable to basically communicate with the people around me made me feel helpless and every single issue I was struggling with fed itself. My shame, the shunning I experienced, my high anxiety all fed themselves and their derivatives. There was a marked snow ball effect going on.\n\nI used to think maybe I had autism because of the above. I'd only heard of people with autism struggling with the above as much as I did. I now see having both trauma and autism as too complicated of an explanation, so my guess is I just have trauma. I even question if I ever had SM at all. I know that my lack of speech was one of my main preoccupations and what I subjectively felt was most holding me back. I think I needed support from my school in regard to accommodations, but have not ever developed a good working relationship with a psychiatrist who isn't invalidating or near abusive or just abusive to help me figure out what happened. Anyway, I'm sharing this in case it sounds familiar to any of you. All my life I felt like a basket case until I read that book and it covers all my major issues, so I don't have to self diagnose with everything on the DSM.\n\nFor those of you who struggle to talk and have trauma, self soothing techniques should be trauma informed. Trauma work is what has most helped me overcome my social anxiety, low self-confidence and communication issues.

I only spoke to my friends. Literally no one else besides them, except maybe the P.E. coach heard my voice. When my friend's friends would show up I would literally freeze and not utter a single word nor move a single muscle. Something just felt unsafe? I felt like I was paralyzed and was unable to get any movement out of my body, but there were always racing thoughts inside my head. Not even a little whispery \"hi\" or a hand wave.\n\nThis similar thing has come back and happened a couple of times recently. I get invited to a virtual hangout. If it's just with my friends, I am able to communicate perfectly fine. But if at least one of my friend's friends make an appearance that scenario of being mute as a child happens again. It's something about their presence and it changes everything about me. I cannot even introduce myself. I don't even send any text messages. No introductions, no goodbyes. I just pop in hang around for how long I can tolerate it and then leave like a ninja. When I was younger I would always just sit in silence and discomfort the entire time, but as an adult I leave when my energy is depleted and I know things are going downhill for me. I don't even hate or dislike the friend at all, it's nothing like that, but something just makes me feel unsafe to the point where I cannot say/text any words because I feel like it makes me vulnerable and that I may leave a poor impression on said friend(s) of friend...\n\nMy mind is always filling itself up with sentences and I usually have something to say.

I grew up in a somewhat abusive/emotionally neglectful household (I say somewhat bc I never really talked about it enough to be definite but even wo the label it was a hard place to grow up). When I was young, I taught myself that the only 2 emotions that were acceptable was happiness (bc being quirky and cute and funny made people like me) and sadness (but only when I was alone). Everything else I did my best to push down and ignore even if it meant not feeling anything at all. Another thing I had taught myself was that I should never tell anyone anything I thought \"mattered.\" Which basically meant anything that I thought made me vulnerable to attacks. This didn't just mean talking about feelings and stuff, but even a simple \"what do you want to be when you grow up?\" would be answered with lies in case my real answer was scrutinized or ridiculed. Sometimes it was easier to just say nothing if I thought that saying anything was too dangerous. \n\nThis mostly applied to my own parents or any adult authority figure. When my dad had locked me in my room to angrily confront/eventually threaten me into telling him about my depression/suicidal tendencies I didn't say anything and was stuck in there for hours. When they took me to see therapist over the years I lied through them until I met one who actually seemed like he cared and who I actually trusted, but even though I desperately wanted to talk to him I literally couldn't bring myself to speak. It was frustrating how every session I would have so many things I wanted to talk about in my head to just end up sitting there crying in silent frustration. We made a little headway but not much and eventually I stopped seeing him. \n\nFast forward to now. I'm still depressed as hell and now with some bonus GAD! I'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist (who I don't really like but w everything going on I'm not sure if I'll be able to find another one) and I still can't bring myself to talk about anything /real/. I end up downplaying my experiences or straight up lying about how I'm feeling, bc I know if I actually try to talk about it something will literally block me from saying anything. And when I say that most people usually think I mean that it's just really really really hard to talk about and that's not it. I mean LITERALLY impossible, like my vocal chords just refuse to cooperate. Dealing with this my whole life has made it impossible to reach out to anyone let alone mental health professionals, but my mental health has been spiraling down the drain and I'm starting to really lose hope. \n\nAlso this problem has caused serious rifts in my relationship. Everything else is literally perfect except my tendency to go mute whenever we get into an argument. And my bf is a sweetheart who never raises his voice, but when I detect frustration or tension between us bc of a conflict it sets me off into some major anxiety and even though I want to talk about it and resolve whatever the misunderstanding is I physically CAN'T bring myself to speak. And my bf thinks that I'm just trying to avoid the conflict even though I've explained that I DO want to talk I just literally cant. And even if he does get it, he gets frustrated/stressed out by me not talking bc he feels helpless bc he doesnt know how to make me better and make it stop and honestly neither do I. \n\nAnd anyway idk if anyone's going to read this, but if you do I really need some help. I don't know how I'm going to keep going like this. I'm so tired and in pain all the time and if I don't figure out how to get help I dont know what I'm going to do.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3232, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Please help idk I have selective mutism but whatever it is, it sucks and ruining my life", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/gdv385/please_help_idk_i_have_selective_mutism_but/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Nruss10", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_39pc4d50", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1588597896, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/gdbcfs/being_sm_in_quarantine/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gdbcfs", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/gdbcfs/being_sm_in_quarantine/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1588597897, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m nervous even typing this so bear with me.

I apologize if it's too vague. But it's already a little troubling for me to meet eye contact with people but it's especially hard when I shut down like this. The only way that I feel comfortable communicating is with my s/o by writing or typing or with the school councilor. It hasn't gotten that bad in a while but the fear of not being able to talk kind of scares me because I'm usually a rather talkative person.\n\nWith the zoom calls, I've only really had one situation that I can recall at the moment. I was put into a breakout room with someone I have a little bit of a stupid grudge on, but pretty much a few minutes after I was put into the breakout room with him, I just turned off my mic and didn't talk at all. I just kinda....didn't want to. I'm not sure if that situation in particular was selective mutism, but do with the information as you will. \n\nIf you have read through all this, thank you for taking the time and have a pleasant day everyone &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3232, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Wondering if I have Selective Mutism", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/gbcczr/wondering_if_i_have_selective_mutism/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SoulCake14", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6a5pngd7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1588276658, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/gb2zhm/i_give_up_having_selective_mutism_is_really_hard/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gb2zhm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2efe4224-937f-11e9-9b3a-0e7080e6db1c", "link_flair_text": "General Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/gb2zhm/i_give_up_having_selective_mutism_is_really_hard/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1588276665, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am always the problem and the thing that is preventing me from talking to people but it is never other people's fault or our society for preventing progress.

So, I tried typing my answers, but I quickly realized that no one was paying attention to the chat and therefore I ended up just sitting there, muted, feeling awkward and left out. \n\nEventually, the whole group came back together, there was some informational stuff and then they closed things up, but they invited people to stick around a catch up for a bit if they wanted to afterwards.

And suddenly someone that had been in my small group (we don't know each other) said, \"I want to hear anelephantinthegloom speak.\" And I started panicking internally and immediately, but nonchalantly, turned off my camera (my mic was already off).

I just wanted to share my college essay that I wrote two years ago (with minor edits) on my struggle with selective mutism- thought you all would appreciate :)\n\n\u2014\n\nSunset flame swabbed the treetops, making them glimmer like rubies. I puffed up the mountain trail, dodging rocks. A fluttering Alaskan breeze brushed my face like a gentle caress. To listen to the wind in the leaves took me away from the hustle and bustle of thoughts, transporting me to a place where I was at peace. \n\nI reached the summit when the sun cast fire on the Alaska range on my north. I looked around\u2014 Denali, the tallest mountain in North America stood at my west. Dall sheep clung to slopes, laughing at the laws of gravity. Flycatchers dove for insects, ptarmigans soared through the sky, and droning of cicadas added onto the orchestra. This was the most breathtaking scene I've ever encountered. \n\nAs I scanned the landscape I noticed one tree among the masses: an aspen with bright red leaves, like a stray drop of paint on a yellow canvas. Amid the sea of trees, it was the only aspen with red leaves. It stood at the same height as the other trees; it too quivered in the wind. How did it get those colors? I didn\u2019t want to think in terms of cold scientific terms of genetic variance, where it was just a lucky individual to inherit that pigment. Did it feel lonely? I knew that tree's dilemma too well, being different.\n\nDifferent\u2014 If I were to play back all the times people had said that to me the tape would go on for a decade. Even when I first entered a classroom, that word would become my label for the rest of the year. But the word \u2018different\u2019 itself wasn\u2019t used. \u2018Quiet\u2019 was. I was diagnosed with Selective Mutism at a young age, which was a fancy way of saying you can\u2019t speak in certain situations, even if you wanted to. Throughout my school years I yearned to be that kid who made friends without breaking a sweat. However much I tried, that desire slipped further from my grasp by the day. I soon knew what a monster loneliness was. That feeling when you long for something and know you could never get it was the worst feeling in the world. \n\nThe only way I could live with my severe social anxiety was to write it all down. That\u2019s how I got introduced to my destiny: writing stories. I started with neighborhood happenings: that woman across the street with a crazy poodle or the time I left my electronic pony out in the rain and a constant neighing from outside which kept waking me up. There was something about silence which made you a keen observer. The world became my canvas and I was the artist, painting people around me, their conversations, motives, quirks, with layers upon layers of hidden desires and backstories. That girl who wore plaid everyday became an undercover agent. The boy who played in the sandbox was a dragon trainer. \n\nPretty soon, the sun bid a final farewell, and then I was back on the trail. That\u2019s when I noticed something on the ground. A heart-shaped leaf clung to a stone, quivering with a fiery gleam.

We are assigned a work book we are supposed to try and go through. I was told he was \"quiet\" and \"shy\"  before we started and thought that would be fined since I've worked with many quiet kids. However when we started I realized he wasn't willing to say a single word.  I was able to communicate by getting him to nod or shake his head, hold up numbers with his fingers or point to things I wrote. He was willing to respond to me by writing at times,  however his writing is limited at this point so getting him to write down a response is hard since he can't spell many things.\n\nI basically abandoned the workbook we have since it was a lot of reading comprehension and I didn't know how to ensure he was understand what we were reading since he wouldn't say anything and we just worked on writing tasks. Basically I  forced information out of him by asking yes or no questions and then I would write sentences to correspond to what we were discussing.  I would then ask him to copy down what I wrote and I would read it out loud slowly, and then ask him to point to a specific words in the sentence. We talked about vowels a bit and I asked him to underline the vowels in words, etc.   I found out AFTER our first tutoring session he had selective mutism.  (this was a bit of a relief because I honestly felt that he hated me) \n\n I wanted to try and prepare myself a bit for the next session a bit better and do a bit of research but I also kinda wanted some personal advice on tutoring and communicating with kids with selective mutism?

I feel paralyzed, I become a different person in social situations and can barely talk, unless it's to answer a question. I've tried setting goals to smile at people, greet them etc and even that is often too difficult for me. I also don't see the purpose. I don't care that much if I can greet a stranger at the store as if I can converse normally in social settings such as school and work. I'm so sick of being this way and I feel so bad about myself because I can't even communicate effectively and everyone knows how terrible I am socially and it makes things soooo awkward. I can't talk to people and I'm so lonely and just want to make friends. I'm usually very shy and quiet but in one on one settings with people my age I can usually talk a bit more and enjoy time spent with another. But it's not like I have the opportunity to hang out one on one with people who are nice enough to bear with me and want to be my friend. \n\nI feel so stuck.

Instead I go blank in social situations, and am physically unable to come up with anything to say. I can sputter simple responses if people ask me a simple question, but I physically cannot come up with anything to say if someone asks me an open ended question, or if they aren\u2019t asking me an actual question. There is only a few select people I\u2019m comfortable with and therefore am very talkative around them\n\n I can even be acquainted with someone through mutual friends, but even after months I won\u2019t really feel comfortable around the person. They try to engage me, but eventually kinda give up since I\u2019ve never actually talked to them (which is always kinda a relief). From there on out I will say hi to that person, but nothing more than that. \n\nIf I\u2019m with someone I\u2019m not comfortable and someone I am comfortable with at the same time then I go blank, and cannot contribute to any kind of conversation. \n\nThere are also times when I\u2019m in a social situation (not talking to anyone really), and will want to leave, but won\u2019t necessarily leave because I don\u2019t want to even say goodbye to everybody. The issue is just physically saying goodbye. But I feel like I can\u2019t leave without saying bye because then I\u2019m being rude. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like I have conventional social anxiety because I don\u2019t care much about what people think of me, and I\u2019m not scared of the social situation itself. I\u2019m just not naturally comfortable around people. If I make a fool out of myself when people try to engage with me the entire situation is pretty uncomfortable (for the both of us), but I don\u2019t sit there and obsess about what I could\u2019ve/should\u2019ve said.

It looks like he's trying to say something.\"\n\n\"Are you okay? Are you okay? ARE YOU OKAY?\"\n\nLike they're talking to a Japanese tourist, and if they just shout loud enough\u2026 he'll understand English...\n\nI'm in the ER. Again. Second time in 2 years. Suicidality.\u2026\n\nI try to answer. So very hard. My jaw won't move. My tongue's a stranger in someone else's mouth. The best I can squeeze out is yet another groan\u2026.\n\nYeah. I'm fully aware, fully awake. Thinking URGENTLY\u2026 but nonverbally. Images, feelings, physical impulses, sense input\u2026\n\nHarsh lights. Another patient moaning down the hallway. A LOUD crash \u2014 one cart into another, unidentified metal things clattering on the floor\u2026\nStrapped to a gurney, unable to move my arms, I have NO IDEA what's going on inside me. Panicked. Is this...\n\nDeath?\n\nI moan. But can't get words out\u2026 Scared out of my mind. Finally\u2026\n\n\"Not\u2026\" Long pause. \"Jah\u2026 jah\u2026jrah.\" Pause. Swallow. \"Drunk.\"\n\n\"Sure, hon.\" Says the first tech. Then to the other guy, \"Listen, let's go do the gunshot. Come back and check on this one in 20.\"\n\nHe taps a quick note into the laptop, \"alcohol inebriation,\" then they rush out. And that's that.\n\nI'm alone. Confused. Disoriented. Panicked.

But I have no mouth\u2026\nSelective mutism isn't just embarrassing\u2026\nIt can be dangerous.\n\nNote: This is my personal experience. And, below, personal coping strategies.\n\nI don't know how others experience mutism\u2026 and can't even imagine what non-speakers go through.\n\nAnd as is my autistic habit, this may be WAY too detailed...\n\nI'm in my 60s. Generally, pretty damn articulate. Despite my other autistic deficits\u2026 known for my wiseguy humor, intelligence, compassion\u2026 and sudden meltdowns.\n\nTo survive straight, neurotypical culture, I rely on my learned, studied ability to say the right thing at the right time\u2026 my mind my only real strength....\n\nLosing my language ability? Shudder.\n\nIt happens frequently for me when I'm stressed... Usually socially overwhelmed. But it can also happen when tired, or even joyfully excited.\n\nI'm really old (for an autistic male). So, I've been dealing with this a really LONG time.\u2026\n\n### What's MY selective mutism like?\n\nIt happens in stages, altho not smoothly, mixed, overlapping\u2026 insert video of dam bursting in slo-mo here...\n\n### In social situations,\n\nI can become mute many times a week.\n\nIt may begin by having trouble finding words. Like a tip-of-the-tongue experience on steroids... I know what I want to say... In that I have the feeling of knowingness... But words, phrases won't come out.... Or, more severely, even come to mind.\n\nJust this alone, struggling to find a word, may UP my anxiety or frustration enough that I begin to stammer or stutter. As if my jaw, lips, tongue, throat are flailing around. Something like when I lose my balance and my arms flail in all directions as I fall. Emergency, wild, panicked attempts to return to \"balance.\"\n\nThe internal urgency... Which may be anxiety mixed with frustration mixed with forceful compulsion mixed with severe embarrassment... May heighten from here rapidly. At some point, my brain freezes. Everything shuts down. Not a rational choice... Just mind and body... Give up?\n\nSometimes the experience is so intense I have a \"white out\"... Just bright white light in my head. Briefly, no other awareness of surroundings.\n\nThis process, falling from intense conversation into wordless, animal-like moans &amp; grunts, can seem to take an eternity to me...

They know what to look for. OFTEN, they may notice the symptoms before I do and alert me\u2026\n\nI may get louder\n\nI may stammer or stutter\n\nI may become fixated on finding \"just the right word\"\n\nI may start having longish, glazed-eye pauses as I focus on the internal experience of overcoming that \"tip of the tongue\" feeling\n\nI may unknowingly begin to speak over everyone else\u2026 caught up in the unfolding internal drama\n\nI use my own hypervigilance to observe me. Like some autists, I suffer from alexithymia, difficulty knowing my feelings, motivations, and other internal states. BUT, I've also become adept at hypervigilant observation\u2026 noting tiny cues in others... micro-grimaces, glazed eyes, eyebrow gestures, tiny shrugs. I may not, usually don't know what they mean, but know something's up. So I've learned ask whoever I'm with\u2026 frequently avoiding social difficulties. AND now I've learned to use that skill on myself\u2026\n\nis my stomach nervous?\n\nDiaphragm tight?\n\nAm I getting louder?\n\nHaving trouble finding words?\n\nEtc\n\nI tell the person I'm with\u2026 if I have reason to trust him or her or em\u2026 that I may be having trouble speaking. Sometimes simply acknowledging out loud it may be happening can make the effect subside. At the very least, it reduces their astonishment. (BTW, talking out loud to myself is another survival strategy for me. It clarifies my purpose, gives me direction, keeps me focused in a way internal thought frequently fails.)\n\nI try a number of techniques that I've foubd may return balance...\n\nAsking for a moment to \"collect my thoughts. Then consciously, mindfully pausing, observing my body, mind, breath. If the rush of verbal thoughts returns, continuing to observe my internal states until they subdue enough to pick one thought to express. In detail, sounds tough. In practice, within a few seconds, I know if I can continue\u2026 or must seek alone time.\n\n3 or so deep, slow abdominal breaths... What some folks call \"cleansing\" breaths. Many times a day, this heads off my more severe difficulties, including mutism.\n\nA brief break alone in a quieter, darker room. No Facebook!\n\nA brief walk alone (without unnecessary stimulation. NOT the time to walk my dog, Buddy.)\n\nFocusing on any detailed, pleasurable, physical activity\u2026 sweeping the floor, shaving, watering plants...anything not involving language.\n\nSometimes scribbling a word, brief note, or sketch can both communicate something to those around me... Or even re-establish balance and language ability\n\nThe panic of a wordless \"high functioning\" autistic...\n\nWho generally relies on articulate speech as their main defense in the world\u2026\n\nIs never a pretty thing.\n\nThese are some strategies I've found so far that may protect the public, loved ones, and myself from the effects.", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;My personal experience of selective mutism.

But it can also happen when tired, or even joyfully excited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really old (for an autistic male).

Like a tip-of-the-tongue experience on steroids... I know what I want to say... In that I have the feeling of knowingness... But words, phrases won&amp;#39;t come out.... Or, more severely, even come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just this alone, struggling to find a word, may UP my anxiety or frustration enough that I begin to stammer or stutter. As if my jaw, lips, tongue, throat are flailing around. Something like when I lose my balance and my arms flail in all directions as I fall. Emergency, wild, panicked attempts to return to &amp;quot;balance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The internal urgency... Which may be anxiety mixed with frustration mixed with forceful compulsion mixed with severe embarrassment... May heighten from here rapidly. At some point, my brain freezes. Everything shuts down. Not a rational choice... Just mind and body... Give up?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the experience is so intense I have a &amp;quot;white out&amp;quot;... Just bright white light in my head. Briefly, no other awareness of surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This process, falling from intense conversation into wordless, animal-like moans &amp;amp; grunts, can seem to take an eternity to me...

The problem is all about talking. Talking with someone that is not part of your close family- or, maybe, a friend if you're lucky. \n\n  I'm 16 and today I kinda gave up on trying to talk. At first, when I was just a kid, I could talk only to my parents, sister and a friend, I didn't use to try to talk, so I just got silent when someone tried to speak with me, if it was a question I usually would answer \"uhum\"- for a \"yes\"- or \"um um\"- for a \"no\". Growing up was hard, but my \"mutism\" didn't stop me from doing what I liked. I liked to play soccer and I was pretty good, although no sound came out of my mouth, but I guess my friends understood this (I was lucky having such good friends). I made some some friends in my Growing way. Although now I have no friends. My classmates are still pretty understanding on me and sometimes I tried to talk. \n  Now I have a 7 years old brother and he's such an amazing person (he has some child problems, like not hearing my parents and, even, yelling to them) and I love him. He likes everything that I like- probably because of my influence on him- and we're always together. My sister, 20, is, maybe, as adorable as him. We may like different things, but she's always on my side and she is, probably, the person that understands me the most. \n  You're, probably thinking why am I giving up on talking to different people, it's simple: most of the people don't understand my incapacibility on talking and it's been over 2 years since I started treatments on this \"shyness\" and nothing changed- maybe it's worse. Six months ago I said to my parents if I could go to a psychiatrist- since the last treatment was like astrology. So here I am completely equal to 2 years ago taking stupid medications and wondering why I am not at an Asylum being accused of killing a cotton candy. Is it that hard to do a diagnosis and then my parents would say something like: \"Hey, he has 'bla bla bla' so if you want to talk to him be concious that he's, probably, not going to answer you, but try it may be good to him\". And, then, everyone would understand me since it's too hard for me to use words and I am never able to show my feelings and thoughts.\n  So if this happy ending can't happen, then sorry but I am tired of this, it's easier to just shut my mouth and never say a word.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 2898, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "When I gave up on trying to talk", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/erz8lj/when_i_gave_up_on_trying_to_talk/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "BatmortaJones", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_222anhv0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1579575201, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/eroc43/anyone_have_a_job/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eroc43", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/eroc43/anyone_have_a_job/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1579575202, "score": 1, "selftext": "I absolutely cannot make it through an interview and I'm frustrated.

As many are unaware of the condition, it is often difficult to make schools agree for adjustments and additional support.\n\nBelow are some of the reactions I received:\n\n1. People accused me of being selfish to demand 45 mins of 1-1 time from teacher each week to do fade in sessions. They said this is injustice to normal kids as they don't get similar attention. And teachers would be spending this 45 mins doing more productive things for normal kids instead.\n\n2. Some said, kids with SM should not be in regular schools but be in Special needs schools. They went on and said this is why they prefer more private schools because private schools can kick any students out who they don't want and other bright kids don't need to put up with such nonsense.\n\n3. When I said, \"kids with SM don't need 1-1 attention throughout, they only need bit of adjustments and teachers around need to be educated about the condition to support effectively\", one of the participant claiming to be an educator got offended and said they will never help kids of parents who think teachers need to be educated. He/she said teachers are already heavily educated and don't need parents to say that they need to be educated.\n\n4. Last comment I received is - \"Stop telling/treating your child like they are a nutter. Stop the media campaign advertising to your child they are a nutter with some kind of condition no one else understands\"\n\nI know people can be mean in online forums as they don't know people whom they are taking to. But, I wonder if people in real world think the same when we say our problems - though they don't express it.\n\nFor me, most concerning is comment made by teacher (3).

Since my childhood, I've been stuttering and due to the same, I started having social anxiety. I would abstain from speaking in social situations fearing that I would stutter and make fun of myself. I was around 8 years old when I realized that I was not 'normal'. Slowly my stuttering reduced as I grew up and I started having very easy conversations with my friends and family. But the fear that I would mess up a social situation was still there. I would easily express my thoughts to the people I was comfortable with. But in certain situations, even with my family, I cannot utter some words that I want to. So I utter a synonym that comes out of my mouth. This has been with me always. Never have I ever spoken what I really want to. Every time the conversation is distorted because of my inability to speak out in certain scenarios and with certain people. I have had encounters with people where I get stuck on a word and then just go blank and speak nothing. I can't explain how weird the situation becomes. I don't even know what the other person thinks of me at that point in time. This adds to the anxiety and stays with me for weeks. I regret the social situation when I stood frozen. I get nightmares about it and can not get over it for months. Many times I find myself in the middle of something and then the memory of those situations makes me feel miserable for no reason. \n\nIn the current phase of my life, I am hunting for jobs. My first interview was a month ago. I knew all the answers that the interviewer asked me but due to the fear, I constantly kept changing words in order to be able to speak them out. But it happened again. I stuck in a word I wanted to say and I went blank. I looked at the panel and just froze. They looked surprised. They thought I was nervous which I was and tried to motivate me. Nothing worked. I just wanted out. I still tried answering the next question. I knew the answer by heart but again was not able to express it. They were fed up by my inability to speak up and asked me to leave.\n\nIt's been a month now and I've not appeared for any other interviews. I don't know what to do. I'm from Nepal. My people don't care about mental health. I can't tell my parents or friends about it. I want to help myself. Is this Selective Mutism? When I looked online, this condition was closest to mine.

More recently my anxiety has developed into an extreme inability to talk to anyone except my closest friends(not even my parents). It feels like however hard I try no sound will come out, no matter what. In these situations sometimes I can gesture or use fingerspelling or writing, but usually, that just worsens the building anxiety because of the perceived awkwardness of the situation. It is almost like to \"protect\" me my body forgets how to talk, I can struggle all I want to make the smallest of sounds, but nothing that requires the vocal cords works(sometimes I can do sounds that only require the manipulation of air like 's' but even that is anxiety inducing). Before this started happening regularly (A year ago, when I moved across the country), I had difficulty talking, mostly because of a lot of overthinking and believing that I would be perceived badly. Sometimes if I am somewhere where I am comfortable I can talk to my parents, but talking, in general, is laborious and anxiety causing. Sometimes I will talk somewhere I am uncomfortable, even initiate conversation sometimes(shudder) because the anxiety caused by not talking in a highly social place like school is even worse(I tried, but finally after a few weeks I was able to force myself to talk in the classroom as long as it was only to my group partners and professor and I only had to speak a sentence or less at a time.) Now I can talk in that class (I only take one class in person) freely to those few people, but iI am about to change classes and I'm freaking out. I feel some of this could be attributed to the anxiety caused by me moving to a place where I am highly uncomfortable all the time minus a few rooms in my house and the local ice rink, which would fit with SM being a situational anxiety disorder, except the situation that I am uncomfortable in is the giant state of Texas(yay me!) Also, it's only getting worse, because as I become more aware of the issue I become self-conscious of it and that just makes more anxiety which makes the whole situation worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if the writing is very stream of consciousness style. When I'm posting in a public place I have to write very quickly and try not to look back over what I have written to avoid the anxiety that would inhibit me from seeking the help of you amazing reditors. Also, if you were curious I am already on medication to treat my preexisting anxiety disorders and it is one often used to treat SM. And no, I haven't brought it up with my therapist, talking with him for more than a few words and only when prompted is impossible, so bringing up a topic myself is probably not going to happen. If you kind people think what I am experiencing may be SM could you point me to some resources that might help me better handle it?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 2845, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Could I have SM?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/ej9hwa/could_i_have_sm/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "macavek", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_si2mzq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577997091, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "edited": 1578004159, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/ej3s2v/i_may_have_sm_help/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ej3s2v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/ej3s2v/i_may_have_sm_help/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578080698, "score": 21, "selftext": "I discovered this term yesterday, and it clicked a little.

Was always extremely shy , I never went and made friends on my own. Always have had social anxiety. If I was upset or anxious I would go silent.

This led to me crying and again, staying silent. She was the best therapist, I had most of my success with her. We bonded and I actually began to open up to her. Unfortunately she was a high risk therapist so I had to stop seeing her.

Then my stupid brain decided that it would be a good idea to isolate myself more and to talk EVEN LESS than what i was doing before. My social anxiety grew worse I got more nervous around people and I felt like everyone was judging me and i've felt this way ever since :D.

I didn't know it existed and now I'm glad I do. Here's my story that I posted there. I thought it would be nice to put it here. At the end I'll add in how it has affected me to this day.\n\nI've had it as long as I can remember starting back when I was in an abusive foster care home. That was when I was 4. My parents said that before I was \"super talkative\" but after I just got quite. For the first year of being home with my family I only whispered to them. It took until my baby sister was born for me to talk out loud to them.\n\nWhen school started I learned to just whisper to the teachers. But before I had to make sure no peers were in earshot. I just saw school as a living hell that I had to endure everyday. If a classmate wasn't asking \"Why don't you talk?\" they were trying to trick me into talking or trying to make me laugh (looking back I appreciate but at the time I hated). I would always want to join in on their conversations and they would try and get me to; I would even have a whole response drafted in my head of to what to say but there would be almost like a dam blocking the words from coming out of my mouth. Sometimes I would write it down on paper and give it to them and sometimes I would try to \"show\" it. It would always upset me when they misinterpreted what I was trying to say and then they would run with it. I would be so frustrated because it's not what I meant. When my parents would pick me up from school, I would not open my mouth until the car doors were shut and the windows were up; I was that terrified of someone hearing me.\n\nFrom preschool to 5th grade I didn't give a crap about school for obvious reasons. But in 5th grade I finally had a teacher who didn't try and force me to live up to the other kids standards or try and dumb everything down for me. He set goals for me and he made sure that I met those goals, whether that was staying with me after school, taking me into a separate room if I had questions, or regularly checking with me that I was good at my desk throughout the day. He made me care about school and made the learning enjoyable for me. Back on the school track. I went from being a D student to A student within the year.After 5th grade I made sure to get everything done and do it fully.\n\nOn a side note I did have 1 true friend throughout some of this. This was in 1st grade. We became friends after she told me to call her when I got home (she gave me her number). When I did I sat there with listening to her saying \"Hello?\" for a good couple minutes and I finally got up enough courage to say \"Hi.\" I immediately hung up the phone. After that weird exchange, I then started to whisper to her and continued to do so until about 5th grade when I finally had enough trust in her to speak normally. We spent so many hours watching Disney channel and playing club penguin and making dumb YT videos (basically normal early 2000's kids stuff). We stayed best friends until about 8th grade when she went down a deep hole of depression and anxiety and so I did I and we just stopped talking. And we haven't really talked much sense. The only time I can really remember was when her grandpa died I showed up for a couple minutes at his celebration of life.\n\nI was every teacher's' pet... their \\*very\\* quiet pet, lol. All my projects and essays would be used as examples. I was proud that I was able to do that. It stayed that way until 9th grade. The year started great as normal (I was already acclimated to the school because it was a Jr./Sr. high so all grades 7th-12th were there; there was no real difference between the two because it was the same building and same teachers). Anyway, I started having to miss classes to go to my therapy appointments (which were an hour away because we live in a small town). The fear of facing the teachers and my peers and having to explain (at least to the teachers) what I was going on; I started to freak out. I started asking my dad to let me stay home \"because I have an appointment later.\"\n\nBTW tail end of 8th grade was when I started seeing my therapist (I'd never seen one before) and that was only because I begged my parents because I felt like no one could understand me at school. Anyway, I also started taking antidepressants in October of that year so it probably factored into this.\n\nI stopped going to school. My dad would literally drag me out of my bed. One time while my school counselor and vice principal was there he dragged me out of the car so I could go to school. I just ended up having more panic attacks because I felt like everyone was disappointed in me.\n\nA few months before this is also when I got my emotional support cat, Minnie. She went to and still goes to every single therapy appointment with me. She'll either sit next to me or she'll go and do something in the office until she senses I'm starting to worry.\n\nAnyway, again, then some really bad family stuff happened and it just added on to the crap pie. All you need to know was my whole family had to stay at my grandma's house. I ended up missing so much school I was marked as truant and was set to appear in court. Thank god my counselor at the school knew about the state's online school and she helped me get signed up for the next year. Back on the court thing, I didn't speak to the judge but my parents, my vice principal and counselor all said what was going on and that I was signed up for online school for the next year and my therapist even wrote him a letter. I remember while I was literally crying in front of him from the stress he asked my VP (she had to do it because of the state laws) \"Why on earth is she here?!\" and he sent me home.\n\nOnline school was the first time I talked to non-friend peers. It took me until freaking 10th grade to actually have a conversation with a fellow peer!!! Now I'm a senior. I've done prom committee every year so far since I've been at the online school and made acquaintances with some peers. Now I work at Albertsons as a courtesy clerk and am kind of basically living on my own (in my grandma's house).\n\nWorking had increased my social interactions at least 10 folds. Now that I'm working I'm seeing all the time that I've lost with social interaction. I've missed out on 13 years of learning. I keep getting told things by my manager that stems from not talking for X amount of years. She understands why but it still gets to me and I understand why she has to say it. (most of the time it's me making a bad jab at sarcasm or just me trying to control something). I have had now a couple panic attacks at work. The one time I literally had tears in my eyes but didn't want to stop to fully breakdown until my shift was over with which was about 3 hours. I was mildly... crying... in... those... 3... freaking... hours. THE WHOLE TIME!\n\nI've now seen the same therapist for almost 4 years now. I haven't been able to talk to anyone from my old school yet but hope to eventually and hopefully I get up enough nerve to message my friend. In school I'm kind of falling behind because of procrastination and just senioritis; it's freaking exhausting. I'm working with my online school counselor to stay on track but it's still hard. I'm only half a credit behind on what I missed from Freshman year which I'll make up next semester.\n\nBesides what I already wrote before, here's what else I struggle with. I struggle to figure out when people are joking or being sarcastic. I make jokes at bad times. I have a hard time not apologizing for every little thing. I struggle to tell someone that I relate to their story and often times feel awkward because all I can say is \"Oh no\" or \"I'm sorry.\" It really does frustrate me. My therapist as helped me recognize that it's not my fault and that I'm learning just like any other kid would be. I do feel terrible when I can't pick up on this stuff faster especially since I thought had it all down from just observing people all these years.

I have a wonderful experience to share. I finally broke through my selective mutism, and it may be of use for you to learn how / what happened. \n\nFirst, the background. I'm 39yo now, and got \"infected\" with the silence virus when I was about 6yo. I remember it very will, because it coincided with an outburst of my alcoholic father telling me to \"shut up those sounds coming from your mouth\". My household was verbally belligerent. I was a shy and scared little boy, and I internalized the message not to speak in my father's presence. As a boy and teenager, there were many more situations where me speaking up was severely reprimanded (bad luck, I guess). And as a consequence, I simply couldn't speak freely anymore. I developed a case of Selective Mutism and it stuck with me into late adulthood.\n\nI could speak to my siblings, or any familiar person in a 1-on-1 setting, but the fear of being verbally destroyed by a person in authority would forever prevent me from speaking up in a group setting. No matter how much I enjoyed talking, I would completely freeze up if there were unfamiliar people around. If I was talking to someone, and another unfamiliar person joined the conversation, I would freeze up, and no longer able to speak. It's not the fear of talking, but rather the (anticipated) fear of being reprimanded for talking that killed my voice.\n\nEven among groups of very familiar people, I often would speak as little as possible. Only when I felt absolutely confident that I could speak without being reprimanded for it, I would speak. So, for 33 years, I led a life of silent loneliness, unable to interact much socially with people (despite being a very out-going person!). Yes, I made friends, when I met people 1-on-1, but in group settings, I always felt \"stuck\", I felt I wanted to speak so badly sometimes it drove me nuts. I became very depressed, even suicidal for several years (not sure if it's just related to the Selective Mutism). SM completely ruined my social life, my sex life, my family life, my relationships, and friendships, everything. I JUST COULDN'T SPEAK!\n\nI didn't even know about SM until I was 38. No one ever told me I might have a \"condition\". Sure, some people remarked I was often silent when they expected me to speak. I often felt the awkwardness of not being able to speak. Some people called me \"reticent\", and they were right, though I didn't want to be. That's how my journey to healing started when I began googling psychological conditions and reticence. There was one website that linked a sort of verbal reticence (shyness) to Selective Mutism. I began reading a dozen books on the topic, and BOOM, that was me. I finally understood myself, and my past, all at once.\n\nI wanted to get rid of this condition. I knew I wanted to have a fulfilling social life. I knew I wasn't \"shy\", I was just inhibited, reticent, unable to speak up when I wanted to. But it's one thing to become aware of your condition. It's a whole other thing to break out of it. In the end, the healing process took me 2 years. For 33 years I hadn't been able to express my thoughts, views, emotions, feelings publicly or in groups. I had diminshed myself to a shadow of I really was. And I wanted my life back. Here's what I did:\n\n\\- I wanted to win back my voice. So I began to read books out loud (in the privacy of my bedroom). At first, I was terrified people my hear me! Assuring myself that my neighbor's couldn't hear me speak (no one could), I kept doing these exercises.\n\n\\- I began learning a new language on Duolingo, giving me a justification to speak the sentences out loud. I happened to spend some time in a foreign country, and I forced myself not to waste my language study and to actually use it. So, I did--and this meant I was speaking very basic Hungarian in public. I was having minimal conversations with checkout girls, to whom I could normally speak not a single word.\n\n\\- These steps were necessary, but brought me nowhere near healing. I had to go through something I would describe as a psychological re-awakening. I had to really breach the barrier. And I had to become more CONFIDENT as a person in order to do so. So, before I began trying to speak, I began working on my confidence first. In my case, this mean going to the gym to build muscle, and also buying a mountainbike, simply to go on trail rides (which I enjoy very much). After about a year or so of physical activity, I did in fact become much more confident.\n\n\\- And that's when it finally started. Because I'd kept pushing myself for nearly 1-2 years, I began having short conversations with strangers (i.e, the people who work in supermarkets, store clerks etc.). I was able to ask them for all sorts of things I needed, and even crack a joke now and then. I began noticing people take no offense whatsoever hearing my voice. People had no problem with my speech. Most returned smiles, and most enjoyed conversing with me. \n\n\\- A collected quite a lot of these \"positive interactions\" and these slowly began overriding my Selective Mutism. But I had to go one step further. One day, late at night, I went to a beach. It was cold and stormy. I was by myself, and had spent an hour before walking through the dunes. When I reached the sea shore, I was all by myself, and for some reason, I felt this intense need to just YELL at the sea. And I YELLED and YELLED and YELLED everything I felt I should yell. Lots of things came out of my mouth, good and bad, inspiring and destructive. I must have spent half an hour shouting at the sea. And it was wonderful. \n\n\\- When I felt I had nothing left to say, I continued walking along the sea shore, and I remembered something very important. That before I got Selective Mutism, I used to be a talkative kid. And I used to love singing sons, sometimes with my siblings. I remembered my favorite song--and I sang it again. I felt I re-connected with the child I once was. This brought some tears to my eyes. I embraced myself, gave myself a hug, and said, \"I've found you\" (meaning the talkative former me). \n\nThat day at the beach, at night, I found my voice again.

I have never been diagnosed but I knew that I suffered from it being the kid who did not talk at all in school. I'm fully recovered to the point that people I currently meet would not suspect I had a prior history of SM. I've even got a couple \" Hey, you're noisy \" statements which I actually take as a 'compliment' and a reminder of how far I've come the past 4 years.\n\nI however would not say it is all smooth roads for me ever since I overcome it. \n\nAs I would like to phrase it, I reckon that I had not had a proper childhood/social life for close to 8 years during that developmental period that I suffered from SM. In some way, I have very limited social experiences having had only 4 years up to now. There have been times where I take things too seriously, am socially awkward in certain situations and lack awareness to pick up on social cues. Consequently, it resulted into certain situations where I lost certain friendships, got sidelined when interacting in groups because of my awkwardness and missed out on certain social opportunities.\n\nI also face struggles in my friendships as well. In truth, I do not actually fancy having a large social network but more so towards a small, close knit friend group (say at most 5 or 6) that would do things together and have each other's backs - more towards quality over quantity. I do not have problems interacting with people and maintaining friendships, but it is more towards having a close 'support' friend group that I can count on. \n\nMost of the friend groups that I  initiate, people in it do not even seem committed to one another. Take for example, the friend group I formed in uni. Everyone in there seems to be there out of convenience (just for school work) and we would only do things together during the semester. Once semester breaks start, everyone would not keep in contact immediately. When I do initiate things to do together, they would always come up with reasons that they are busy or that they have plans with their other friend groups probably from high school (the latter is more common). This situation has been the same thing for literally almost every friend group I have formed after high school where the people I meet tend to be more invested in pre-existing friendship circles they have formed before, making me feel helpless and alone.\n\nMoving on to me, I do not actually have a great connection with my high school friends. We do go out at times and though I think they do not have a problem with my presence, at times I would not be invited to certain outings and it would be discussed among the inner circle of the friend group separately. The outings that I do get invited to are few and rare. I conclude that it most likely is their initial perception of me where they still think I'm a little too boring (not to brag but I'm doing good academic wise) and that they still see me as reserved as before - only things that me myself would know is no longer applicable to my current self having grown so much ever since I overcame SM. If only I could actually explain to them what I had suffered from previously (SM awareness is very low and I'm very sure they would just have seen me as they kid who did not talk but suddenly talked), maybe they would be more accepting of me and see me in a different light than before as I have never got the chance to explain to them about my past. It is even more difficult now as the lack of social outings that I would be invited to makes it harder to pivot conversations to this hard-to-discuss-about topic (I would have to feel very comfortable to get to the point that I would want to share it).\n\nThis relates back to the previous point where I feel helpless and alone. The current friends I make, they all have strong pre-existing friendships which negates their necessity to foster deeper connections in the new friend groups they currently make. As for me, I have neither strong pre-existing friendships nor strong current friendship groups and it just pains me to see myself being so helpless and lonely at times. I've read somewhere that the strongest friendships are normally made in around childhood till high school and it makes me lose hope that I'll ever be able to find a friend group that is close in the near future (will be graduating from uni very soon and no friend group that I feel where the people would be invested in the group \\*sigh\\*).\n\nI've been very off putting of engaging in certain social activities or social opportunities such as being in a relationship as I find it can be embarrassing and off putting to some people when they find out about the lack of friends I have in my social life, preferring to engage in solitude with a glimmer of hope that things would change though it looks like it would not.\n\nThis came out longer than I expected and I really appreciate it if you have read it until this point. \n\nTo my fellow post-SMers, how much would you relate to my current struggles? Any advice you would have for me? Do feel free to share about the different struggles you have faced.\n\nTo those still suffering from SM, stay strong! Take baby steps to overcoming it. I will be very glad to help you all out with any advice as I know how difficult of a journey it had been for me.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 2132, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Post-SM struggles", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/egmle3/postsm_struggles/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Peeweeshoop", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_oqpga4v", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577465513, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/egdi9h/questions_from_someone_questioning/", "gildings": {}, "id": "egdi9h", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/egdi9h/questions_from_someone_questioning/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577465515, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019ve looked on and off this sub for probably a year, as I suddenly would have trouble talking.

I think the worst it got was not being able to talk or barely make a noise for 2 hours. \nIt doesn\u2019t happen in specific places, but it usually happens with specific people.

I've never recieved an official diagnosis, but from 1st through beginning 7th grade I pretty much displayed symptoms of it, being almost completely mute in school. I never talked to anyone (though I wanted to), with the exception of the teacher whenever they called on me, and I was extremely socially isolated, only talking to my parents. In the teacher's notes and whenever they would talk to my parents, some of them would ask if I had depression or had some kind of abuse, which I didn't, and my parents would always dismiss it and say I'm fine and only shy.\n\nOver the past year or two I've been slowly recovering from it and beginning to talk more and more because of gained confidence, especially over this school year, where I've gotten to a point of comfort where I can freely talk to most people. I've been experiencing other symptoms of neurodiversity (ADHD I believe) which I think I might have had all along, and might have been what triggered my selective mutism (and I've realised there were signs of it in early childhood too).\n\nMy parents don't really believe in mental illness or that anything's wrong with me, but I don't understand why they dismiss the possibility of it so quickly. When you guys had it in early childhood, what did your parents/teachers think and how long did it take to recieve help? Also, I've never talked to a school counselor before but do they deal with issues like this and is information I give them confidential?\n\nSide note: I don't know if this is worth mentioning but I know that my mom has Thought Disorder, which may be what I have? I only know of this because my dad told me.\n\nThanks in advance.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 2076, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Question about diagnosis", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/ea1fbf/question_about_diagnosis/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sudhindrags", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3p86j170", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575808255, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/e7t73s/question_about_medication/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e7t73s", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/e7t73s/question_about_medication/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575808256, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nMy 7 year old daughter diagnosed as SM is showing some good progress from last few weeks after school agreed to start fade in sessions. She now can speak to one teacher at school irrespective of where she is and who is around her. But, she still has lots of challenges with respect to initiating conversation. \n\nShe generally speak to her peers. But, initiating conversation is something which she cannot do. She is fine if other kids ask her if she wants to play with them. But, she is not ready to do ask them first.\n\nApart from that, we are also finding it challenging to engage her in sports and other activities. She shows initial interest but loses it within first few sessions as it becomes difficult for her to follow instructions and she gives up and shows complete lack of interest.\n\nWith all these going on I am thinking about requesting medication for her in our upcoming appointment with paediatrician. I have not been so much in favour of medication, But, since it is kind of inhibiting her in many ways, I am starting to think about this.\n\nI want to know following from you:\n\n1. If you are a parent of kid who is under medication, at what age did you start medicating your kid and how many years you waited to see if it can be solved via therapy.\n\n2. Do you regret your decision to medicate or not medicate your kid at certain point of time or do you regret not medicating earlier?\n\n3. If you are SM and have attempted medication path, happy to learn your experience in this path.\n\nI have been reading about side effects and other risks associated with this.

Then I\u2019d go onto the next grade and the cycle would start all over again with a new person. \ud83d\ude14 \nMy strange behavior left my feeling isolated, out of control, and different from everybody else. \nFortunately however, in 11th grade the new teacher I couldn\u2019t talk to suggested that I should get counseling so I did! Ever since then I began talking to them, and becoming less shy of a person all together! :) \nEven though I\u2019m doing much better now as an 18 year old. I still feel different from other people sometimes and I still freeze up in front of certain people. I don\u2019t know for sure if I have selective mutism, but I defiantly relate to many of the symptoms and find comfort in knowing I\u2019m not alone. \ud83d\udc95", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 2026, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "SM as an older teen/Adult??", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/e4vcvu/sm_as_an_older_teenadult/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "oddsboodkins", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_35lctdfu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575253039, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/e4s0vl/late_mutism/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e4s0vl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/e4s0vl/late_mutism/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575253040, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was thinking here and realized I developed SM late.

I\u2019ve been having a harder and harder time talking for about a year and a half now. My voice was always an enormous point of dysphoria for me. Over the last 6 months I got super into voice training to make my deep, gravely voice more feminine. I did this whenever I got some privacy, but I would work it until it hurt. Then I kept at it until nothing would come out. But I was never satisfied and I kept pushing it and pushing it. The irony is I found myself clamming up in public more and more. \n\nAt first it was whenever I had to use a public restroom, I\u2019m always *terrified* of using the women\u2019s bathroom. I always kept my head down and I never *ever* talk if anyone addresses me, I just nodded or shook my head and did my business and left. Then the grocery store, whenever a clerk tried to ask me anything, ask how I was doing, I smiled awkwardly and avoided eye contact. Now towards the end of October I completely trashed my voice at work and I sound worse than ever. Hours of struggling and straining to sound like the woman am, talking myself hoarse and killing my vocal cords finally caught up to me and even attempting a feminine voice is painful, but if I ever hear my voice even going near a masculine register I contemplate self harm. I\u2019ve been clean nearing two years now  but it kills me if I or anyone else hears my voice. \n\nMy job used to involve me talking a lot, but work heard my voice and keeps me in positions where I don\u2019t have to talk much. It\u2019s been weeks now and I can\u2019t seem to get anything to come out when I want to, all I get is a hoarse, falsetto-like whisper that embarrasses me back into silence. Attempts at voice training cause pain and shame. \n\nI\u2019m gonna have a one on one with my therapist, who for a while now I\u2019ve been seeing in a group setting. I can talk okay if it\u2019s one on one, but I have to be gentle with my voice, and not scare myself into silence. So, I suppose I\u2019m mostly wondering, is this selective mutism? Is the anxiety I experience like a clamping around my throat when I try to talk anything similar? I want to bring it up to my therapist and it would help to put a name to a face, you know?

People around me laugh when something funny happens but I have a hard time doing the same. I don't have friends bc people think I don't like them, bc I never smile at them.\n\nIdk.

Basically my family is awful and I get no attention or love but I\u2019m used to it and I just try not think about it.

I\u2019m just not sure if I should get medicine or try to  get a therapist or something. When I\u2019m drunk I have 0 anxiety and can talk fine or when I\u2019m alone and when I\u2019m singing even if I\u2019m signing in public. \n\nI play basketball and used to run track and don\u2019t have any other problems than I think just really bad undiagnosed anxiety/ social anxiety.

Also, I'm only 13 by the way.\n\nI've always been a really shy person, but recently I feel like it's been a little different. A little while ago, I had to go to a restaurant for a family dinner thing, and my family are very talkative and started bonding with the waiter. At one point the waiter asked me my name, and instead of just answering (which I would usually be able to do), I just froze, got really nervous, and looked over at my mom for help. I've been having more and more instances like this recently. Another one was a few days ago, I was doing some yard work with my mom and then the neighbor randomly came over to say hi. She asked me how I was doing and again, I froze, tried to get the words out, and looked at my mom. I'm not sure if this is a sign or something that I could be developing selective mutism (even though I'm 13) or if maybe it's just my shyness is getting worse from going to virtual school for a whole year. Which goes on to another thing,,\n\nI'm really worried about going back to school next year. I scared that I'll be super shy and start crying in front of everyone or just look super awkward when asked a question. My best friend moved schools this year, so next year I'm not gonna have her. I'm not gonna go too much into school though since I don't want this to be too long.\n\nSomething I see a lot of people with selective mutism say is that they really want to say something but they can't. I wanted to know if this was more of an \"I genuinely want to speak to you, but I'm unable to\" or more of a \"I'm scared to speak to you and I physically can't get the words out but I wish I didn't feel uncomfortable, otherwise I would speak to you\" or maybe a mix between them. I feel like when I've had these situations it's been leaning more towards that I feel super uncomfortable and scared to speak, making me not even want to speak to them. I'd rather not speak, than have to feel uncomfortable. But of course, I don't WANT to be like that and I do WANT to speak to them just not like \"Oh yeah, I would be comfortable speaking to you, I just can't\"... It's more like \"I technically don't want to talk to you but I am really trying, it just feels really uncomfortable and the words won't come out\". Sorry if that's confusing.\n\nOne last thing that is kind of worrying me is that in the past week I've had two dreams about becoming selectly mute. I think the reason I'm having these dreams is that I actually ALMOST like the idea of being selectively mute. Like obviously, I don't want to be like this, but at the same time, my brain likes the idea of not having to talk to people and having a title for it (almost like an excuse). I'm not at all saying it's a good thing for people who have selective mutism, I just kinda feel that way, even though I don't really want to. Anyway, one of the dreams was just a kinda short one where I was at school and I wasn't talking so one of the teachers said \"She has selective mutism, so she doesn't really talk\". The other one was a lot longer and more emotional. A lot of the beginning was just feeling uncomfortable because I couldn't talk to people that know pretty well but haven't seen in a while. But towards the end of the dream, I told my mom why I wasn't talking to them. I said to her that I think I have selective mutism. Her instant reaction was her yelling and screaming at me saying that I couldn't be selectively mute and I need to stop being shy... Yeah, that was scary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, it took a lot of courage for me to post this, so please be nice..  I didn't really say a lot of things that I wanted to because I didn't want this to be super long and boring (which I know it already is).

It's also where I feel my personality comes out the best as my sense of humor doesn't translate in Spanish.\n\nMy Spanish was only with my parents and family but I don't know when or why I just started freezing up in Spanish. I think it started happening more around the age of 8 or 9.\n\nIt's like, I have one personality in English, but extremely tense and awkward in Spanish.\n\nWhen someone who isn't my parents speaks to me in Spanish, I have a hard time talking to them, I tense up. If I'm at a family event and it's all spanish, I can't participate in group discussion, my mind is just blank. Like I have thoughts and opinions in English but can't find the way to communicate them in spanish and the social anxiety I had as a kid is back. I become very aware of my entire body.\n\nHas anyone dealt with anything like this?

people and the therapist would want me to rlly think about why i dont talk and i had no answer. i would just say i was scared theyd judge me so we went with that and worked on addressing that but idk

"score": 6, "selftext": "(edit: just want to apologize for such a long post. didn\u2019t realize how long it was and i\u2019m not sure if anyone will read it all but the words just kept coming lol) \n\ncompletely new here just recently like 10 minutes ago realized i may have sm. ive known ive had social anxiety for years. i\u2019m currently 20 and around 12-13 is when i feel like i really noticed the social anxiety and it got progressively worse. but it always felt different for me than others who also have social anxiety. like obviously itll be different for everyone but a big thing is like i just physically cant talk to people sometimes. i often times know what i want to say or what i should say but i literally cant bring myself to say it.  ive always read social anxiety is the fear of what others will think of u and i do feel that a lot but a lot of times, what i want to say is good or normal or is something that would make them like me more but i just. cant. say. it. \n\nthinking back now, i can think of several examples like how i didnt say a word to any of my pre-k teachers but talked to my friends in class. a big thing is that i literally won\u2019t talk around certain people. the earliest i can remember doing this is around 3rd grade and it progressively gets worse. even if i want to talk, i cant bring myself to say anything. i was in basketball in 6th grade and my coach was saying hi to every team member and everyone said hi back but i couldnt. he got mad and made the entire team (including me) run across the gym and back continually until i said hi. after a few laps i finally gave in but it made me so anxious like i wanted to say hi but i just couldn\u2019t and i dont know why. once, an adult from my church wanted me to talk (i couldnt talk to Anyone from that church and they all always tried to get me to) and he was like i have a dollar right here if u just say hi to me. i was like 10 and $1 was a big deal so i reallyyy wanted to and it was awkward because there were other people there in the room too but i just stared at him and couldnt do it and he eventually left. my dad later scolded me for being rude. i have countless stories where i want to talk but there are certain people (a very big list) where i just wont talk even if i want to, especially in peer social interactions\n\nit\u2019s so natural to me now, i\u2019m always hyper aware of who is in the surrounding area so that i know if i can talk or not. i\u2019m most comfortable around my mom and can mostly freely express myself with her. she\u2019s the most i\u2019m comfortable with and other family members and friends i am more comfortable than other people but still on edge a little. if i\u2019m with my mom and one other person i\u2019m not comfortable talking around, as soon as the person leaves i can immediately start talking to my mom (and vice versa, if im with just my mom talking ill immediately shut up if someone else walks in) \n\noh also i wanna say that it\u2019s really just verbal communication. i am completely comfortable being myself over text or typing. or even like gestures/facial expressions like if i wanna be nice to someone who i cant bring myself to talk to i smile or if someone asks a question i\u2019m confronted nodding yes/no, etc. idk what any of this means and what all sm covers but anyway\n\nit\u2019s annoying because of how it affects every aspect of my life. i moved right before i started high school and i didnt make a single friend at all in high school. i just recently graduated college and towards the end i made a couple friends i met on the bumble app and we text everyday and i love them but when we hang out (which is rare bc were always busy) im super awkward and barely talk. i cant interact professionally to save my life and i get bad performance reviews when deep down i know what i should have done but just couldnt. i cant even talk to half my family like for christmas when everyone comes over i maybe say 5 words the whole few days. i love my family and have things to add to the convo but physically just cant. idk i feel like im not getting out of life what i could and that i missed out on so much because of it. i\u2019m scared to miss out on even more \n\nanyway idk what the point of my post is just kinda talking things out. maybe if anyone else relates or anything it could help validate my feelings idk sorry its soo long!! just straight up ranting right now", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw",

I was picked on in school, eg, few years I sat alone in the cafeteria full of a hundred kids. My parents were physically abusive. I don't mean one time i got slapped and still whine about it. Dad would punch me in the head repeatedly on a fairly regular basis, make me sleep outside in Western Pennsylvania in snow storms. I guess that's fairly common with Irish Americans as we are on that side. Mom Jewish, one time left a mixing bowl of ramens for me on the porch like a dog bowl in the dead of winter after she locked me, in an extremely rural mountainous area, so she was fucking insane too.\n\nSomewhere along the line I just stopped talking to class mates in probably middle school. Like I would sit through all of homeroom and never speak to anyone. What for....But I was fine with friends through my brother(a year younger, and very popular), at karate class, and at home (my parents would be normal in between bouts of crazy). \n\nAt 17 I moved in with my grandmother and didn't have much of a social life for a few years after that. I had a friend or two. I think it really got worse then, because I lost my ability to be social with people also outside of school.\n\nNow at 38 I'm rarely comfortable around other people, i can talk but only a few words of small talk and I've the urge to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. I try to fight it, but I seriously go into fight/flight mode, emphasis on flight. Obviously if I'm drunk the problem goes away but that's not a very good solution to get drunk everyday, and I only drink occasionally with my only friend.\n\nI would like to work on my speaking anxiety but work nights alone and don't have the chance to go to any kinds of social events. \n\nIs there a chance to improve at 38? I think so..I think just forcing myself into uncomfortable situations is the way to go. But I'm really not sure how to go about it.  \n\nI mean there's people at work a few hours a day, but long story short, I became religious around 27 and moved to Israel. I didn't integrate, few Americans here do, they mostly associate with other English speakers..So now there's this whole additional problem of basically being a permanent outsider within society, regardless of how much I speak. \n\nSo even when I try to talk at work and sometimes I do, it never really goes anywhere, and I really think it's more that just I'm a quiet guy or whatever. I think there's this whole dimension of being a designated outsider on top of severe social anxiety.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 4400, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I think I have selective mutism", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/ls8fg2/i_think_i_have_selective_mutism/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ReasonableAnalysis3", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6h9i3qwf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1614218891, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/lrur0t/didnt_know_this_subreddit_existed/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lrur0t", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2efe4224-937f-11e9-9b3a-0e7080e6db1c", "link_flair_text": "General Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/lrur0t/didnt_know_this_subreddit_existed/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1614350104, "score": 23, "selftext": "Well, this is a lovely surprise.\nHi everyone!

mutism ever since I was about 7.. I went to 3 primary schools and 1 secondary school, in my first primary school I spoke normal-ish, to my classmates, to the teachers I spoke but not very often but I still did. On my second school I didn't speak until a year, one day I just spoke, my friends told me I had an adorable voice, and I spoke more and more.. I never spoke a word to some teachers, but I remember one which I'd whisper to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen we moved to a smaller school, it was nice even tho I missed my friends. I spoke on the second day there, and later kind of really quietly whispered a few words to my teachers! Except I spoke in this weird voice, I can't remember but I bet I started doing this voice in my previous school, try sounding like a baby, yeah, that was my voice. It wasn't really that high-pitched, it was more baby-like.. Again I was told my voice was adorable, so it didn't really bother me. But I never had any proper conversations and always acted immature. I'd do anything to make my friends laugh at me if it was to eat a LEAF or food off the FLOOR. I know, disgusting.. But it made them laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to my secondary school, things weren't that different, I spoke on maybe my second week, I had an autistic friend and she told me to say 'banana' I said it and everyone was surprised because I didn't speak before, and I was happy because I had new friends because of it. I hanged around them and continued to say banana.. They'd ask me literally anything 'BANANA' that's the only thing I could say- I hate it I hate it I can't stop saying it. It's like my word now to escape answering any questions or participating in conversations. I want to talk to them I want to be funny, not annoying. I want to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey told me to eat food off the floor and I actually did it, they all laughed and I did too, finally, they liked me. I continued to do it, and get more gross. Once I bited into a f\\*\\*\\*ing apple from the floor, I was gross, they kind of liked it until it just got plain annoying, so I stopped. They hate me now.. What do I do? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and there was this one girl that liked to kick me but when I kicked her back she would scream like she was in pain, I didn't kick her that hard too. She was also smiling and laughing sometimes when I kicked her so I thought she was just joking. Sometimes her kicks actually hurt and gave me bruises but I pretended they didn't hurt. She would sometimes write things like 'Crybaby' on my hand when we watched a move, acting like she saw me crying, I was never an emotional person. She'd just grab my hand and scribble 'crybaby' on it. That made me feel upset and that's why I nearly cried. I'm sensitive, but sad movies don't bother me, especially not a boring educational one about slaves. She did much more stuff but most of the time she would just say things like '\\[ELISCIPS\\] is acting! She talks to me. She's just pretending to not speak so she doesn't have to do this work.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe left. I thought it would be over, I thought my friends would like me now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother girl joined. I'll call her 2. She didn't like me for some reason, she turned everyone against me. I don't want to get into it because this is long enough but she'd say things like, 'Go away freak', 'F\\*ck off' , 'Go kill yourself'. She made everyone call me a freak, she made everyone call me names, she ruined my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe also left to go to another school.. I don't know what I did, but maybe this time I would finally be happy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo, another girl we were hanging out with suddenly started hurting me.

Hopefully that should make it easier, since they\u2019ll be more focused on the dragon and preparing for it. \nI\u2019ve got an hour to mentally prepare myself, and then I\u2019ve gotta try. Wish me luck?\n\nAlso not sure about the flair sorry.\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to actually say anything because I was pretty anxious and focused on the game, but I\u2019m gonna try again sometime soon so hopefully that\u2019ll go better.\nStill pretty proud that I was able to get far enough to nearly speak though ^-^", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit":

i have all the symptoms from the limited information i\u2019ve found on the web, the issue is that i\u2019m not a child. can selective mutism be onset later in life? does anyone have any experience or know anyone with muteness issues that manifested after childhood?

He would still speak a little, one, two or three words at a time, but would shake or nod a lot and only to questions. He\u2019s 20 now, and through all these years my parents have tried to take him to therapy, put him on antidepressants and pretty much \u201cgave up\u201d on him (sad to say) because no one could figure out what exactly his \u201cissue/problem\u201d is. Its very easy to see him as unempathetic, uncaring, and stubborn (due to barely speaking) etc because even if its your birthday he wont say happy birthday unless someone else tells him to (for example). Ive worried a lot about him and my parents not doing enough to help him, and always questioning whether my parents are right in the fact that he doesnt seem to want to help himself (in therapy, trying to engage more with family, etc, have social hobbies) therefore why should we keep trying ? Reading some posts here is helping me understand your viewpoints and how its just not that simple. Also the thing is this selective mutism only seems to be towards my family. Hes made friends throughout school and they talk and hang out (or so ive told, i dont live with my mom and him anymore).  Im worried for his future, ive always been, the summer before he started college he pretty much just locked himself in his room and didnt come out for days, and he still stays in his room unless hes cooking. How do I help him? Am I helping him by not speaking to him, or should I try and talk to him even if its just me talking ? Should i bring up to my parents if theyve considered he has this condition? Sometimes I wonder if this has something to do with the divorce, or if I may played a part and dont remember. My brother and i used to play a lot when we were young. I feel like I dont even have a brother most of the time.

My childhood was not like 'normal' children's. I was the quietest and the most immobile child you could ever see. In the early years of school I was mute and physically slow. My teachers thought that I had low IQ because I was such unresponsive so they refered me to a psychiatrist to give me an IQ test. However, it turned out that I'm gifted as I scored in top 2% of population. Moreover, I got diagnosed with autism, attention deficit disorder and selective mutism. My parents never fully accepted my diagnosis so they didn't search out for further treatment. I got good grades but I felt physically unable to raise my hand and ask a question in class. Also, I had been a loner most of my school life because I felt physically unable to speak. I was devastated because I was blended in the background and forgotten there in school, I sometimes wanted to vanish like a perfume spreading through the air and escaping from the window. My existence had been dismissed most of the time. I have always felt like a misfit. Selective mutism is extremely underrated, as most people don't even heard of the name of this, they tend to assume that mute people are just stubborn, arrogant, rude, boring or stupid. As I've never taken treatment for selective mutism, I'm still trying to overcome this in spite of people mocking me. I was completely mute in early childhood then in my late childhood and the beginning of my teenage years I became able to say approximately 10 words every day in school, by the time passing words turned into sentences and sentences turned into paragraphs. Now I'm 20 (about to turn 21) and in college I'm able to talk in class, even sometimes join debates, and make articulate presentations in front of class, and have conversations with friends. However, I still can't say that I overcome selective mutism 100%, there are still times that I feel physically stuck to talk but they happen much less. Despite this, I'm still untalkative compared to an average person. Also having autism makes it hard for me to understand social dynamics of groups and relationships, I still have problems with facial expressions, tone of voice and body language so I might appear socially awkward. Regardless of the struggles I face, I'm still hopeful about my journey as I'm improving myself. I might not had been be able to run as neurotypical people at the start of my journey but I first learnt how to crawl and now I can stand on my own feet and one day I'll run. Impossible is the product of our minds, if we don't believe that things are impossible, they'll become possible. I wanted to share my story to remind you that you can do anything you put your mind into. Even if it seems like you are going two steps forward but one step back each time, keep going because sooner or later you'll reach your destination. \ud83e\udd17", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 4192, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Defying Odds", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/kysdc0/defying_odds/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "redditred88", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7bvm09r0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1610769780, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/kybiqp/is_selective_mutism_comorbid_with_odd_a_lot/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kybiqp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/kybiqp/is_selective_mutism_comorbid_with_odd_a_lot/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1610769791, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have heard this only happens comborbid if the parents are bad parents.

Now I am a dance teacher and an award- winning choreographer, I truly credit the magic of dance for giving me the confidence to push through my anxiety. I am still very socially anxious in certain situations especially those that bring back past feelings of inadequacy.

any of this information is unnecessary to the point, explaining SM issues is always a bit difficult and I didn't want to miss any important bits.\n\nSo I'm diagnosed with SM and it was more significant in primary school (couldn't speak to any adults). Since being at secondary school I've been able to speak 95% of the time with SM appearing a lot less. \n\nI'm 17 and joined a new school this September (moved for sixth form an england thing), this school is aware of my SM as in its probably on the system but I think most of my teachers don't know as with new people I'm able to speak now and sometimes I find if people know I have SM it makes it harder for me to speak. So i think it was only mentioned when we asked them about getting a diagnosis for ASD (haven't got it yet) and we were telling them reasons we think I'm autistic as they are sometimes connected.\n\nThis has been completely fine until online lessons this week when I was asked a question in 2 of my lessons (first time that's happened) and I just froze, I couldn't say anything. Now I'm not sure the best way to approach this, if I say nothing to my teachers they will notice that I don't answer and might get annoyed. But if I tell them I don't think they'll understand: I speak fine in lessons, answer the register for online lessons and I don't think I'll be able to just type my answers into the chat as for me SM pretty much cuts of all my communication even non verbal. So it might come across as me trying to get out of having to do stuff in lessons.\n\nAfter a while I might get more comfortable with online lessons/ might be able to speak with some teachers or might find other ways that work, just at the moment I feel unable to.\n\nIf anyone knows how they would approach this or have any other ways of answering questions in online lessons that could be useful please let me know.\n\nThanks for reading this \ud83d\ude42", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 4152, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Unable to speak in online lessons but fine in person", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/ktpeup/unable_to_speak_in_online_lessons_but_fine_in/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Crazy-Trainer", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5eiiyrkp", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1610171454, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/ktl43z/do_people_still_treat_you_badly_in_adulthood/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ktl43z", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/ktl43z/do_people_still_treat_you_badly_in_adulthood/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1610171465, "score": 1, "selftext": "Do other adults react to your mutism like you are stupid or not talking on purpose and become mean to you?

I was just watching the Big Bang Theory though and heard about selective mutism for the first time. I searched up the signs and symptoms and everything seems to make sense to me...\n\n\nI remember being EXTREMELY shy as a toddler. My teacher (in daycare) would ask me a question and I\u2019d just straight up not respond at all, and I wouldn\u2019t speak to a single person there. I even peed my pants one time because I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell her that I needed to go to the bathroom (I\u2019d usually just wait till I was home, but this time I just couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer I guess). I never actually got help for it though and my teachers never seemed to raise any alarms with my parents, as far as I\u2019m aware. I just eventually started forcing myself to talk as I got older I guess?!?!\n\n\nI\u2019m 24 now and still have pretty bad social anxiety to this day. I\u2019ve seen a few psychologists, but I\u2019ve never really found them useful as I can never really being myself to talk about my feelings to them no matter how hard I try. I actually only told my mum about my anxiety today during a fight. She was apologising for neglecting me while growing up and said that my older brother needed more attention than me as he\u2019s been on medication for anxiety since he was 5, and I kinda just blurted out \u201cwell if you paid any attention to me you\u2019d know I had bad anxiety while growing up too\u201d. I\u2019m not sure what kind of anxiety my brother has, but he definitely liked talking about all his feelings to my mum while growing up, whereas I\u2019ve always been very closed off with my feelings. Childhood anxiety definitely seems to run in the family though \ud83d\ude2a\n\n\nDoes this actually sound like selective mutism though?? And how can I get help for my anxiety if I can\u2019t seem to open up to psychologists? I\u2019ve been taking medication from my GP though and it seems to have helped a little, but definitely not enough. Sorry this is so long but I feel lost and don\u2019t really know what to do from here.

(I know it depends on the person though)\n5. (follow up to the 4th) if you do argue/shout with them, would you have a similar reaction after being forced to talk along with the rush that anger/frustration brings you?

I feel like if I did, talking wouldn't be too far away from the current date (I just believe that). Though I just don't give a shit anymore, even if I started to talk now...I just don't see what it gets me. It's like even if I recover, it feels like there's almost an immediate need for recovery again in the same sense. Overcoming SM would be the foundation for New things, but it wouldn't immediately bring me all these New things.\n\nInitially I had met a girl and there was just that hope in the back of my mind that maybe I could have that or have her...but now it's almost 2 months since I did and I just feel that's something out of the question now. It's basically what I put all my motivation into, before that meeting I had no real care to overcome SM. After, I did, and I had never cared more in my life (The path of change, starting at the beginning of July), by the end of July I was the most motivated to overcome SM I had ever been. Though a week into August and I have nothing. There's no cares.\n\nAnd for the last few days for the few times I've gone out in public this month, I don't care as much what others are thinking of me because idk? Does it really matter? I guess I feel like I'm in a limbo.\n\nAnd I was kind of glad thinking college would start on August 30th for my 2nd semester and it's at a New school, but ever since July there's been no motive....I expected to keep building that motive and by the time I was in college classes I'd want to speak, but now I tend to think I'm not going to...and there's no reason not to, it's just there's also no drive to. I just don't care to give any input to anything, I just don't feel like it really matters. If it doesn't lead to some sort of end result, I just don't see value in it.\n\nWriting this is more of a vision, I've kept my self so distracted the last month from the lack of any progress that I haven't had anytime to reflect on too much. I almost cried today, but I don't give my self enough time to cry. I know deep down I don't think I'm mentally there in a good mindset...I feel like there's just no point to the end, anymore.\n\nAt this point in time, I pretty much don't have friends although \"I do,\" the only contact is through the sub-weekly snapchat I'll send to them. Otherwise there's no contact and I am not one to be known to 'want to hang out.' And at the same time I do, I don't.....there's actually this local car show that happens every friday night, but I can't go alone. I only have ever gone with my Dad, if I did go alone I'd be a duck in a puddle (or whatever). I want to be my own person, but at the same instance I just wanna stave off my problems as long as I possibly can until I inevitably die.\n\nI kind of feel like I prefer death at this point, though I know death is no good gurantee. I know I can make my life what I want it to be, but I have to be the one to do that. I feel a lot like the Kid LAROI song \"I Wish,\" where he says \" You say you can't help me, I've gotta help myself. But I need help with that, 'cause I feel so helpless.\"\n\nI've been very isolated this month, where I wasn't last month. My Parents and whole family basically got sick and that's where it all went away...I would only say I've regressed this month. I was picking up food for a while for my family in August, but the latest time and I had to have my sister come with me to go inside and get the food, I just had no interest to do it. And I didn't want to. Although I did it before about 5 times on my own. Although I'm nervous as shit each time.\n\nI do want to recover relatively soon, my goal was 19 but idk if the motivation will ever come back in time enough to shoot for that. School is soon and life is going to return to how it was before I wanted change, I feel like I'm going to be stuck in my own blackhole once again and change won't come. It all just sucks.\n\nAnd my Mom is actually in the hospital because she came down with Pneumonia and they're keeping track in case of Blood Clots, but I don't feel sad about it or worried or anything. When it comes to any problems like this in my life, unless it has to do with me. I just can not feel for it, anything I feel emotion for comes from myself being able to directly relate to it, otherwise I don't feel emotion for anyone else. I feel like I'm not empathetic, and the emotion I do give off is more so to stave away the questions about the lack of it. I think it has to do with my unhappiness. It's very hard to get me to genuinely laugh person to person. And it's with talking too there's just nothing I'd actually care to discuss, as to me most things are meaningless.\n\nWith that dream of a life with that girl I met, I felt like I saw some sort of path there, but now there's no path.\n\nThat's it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5314, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I've only regressed in the month of August, I don't really see the point in recovery...although I feel like if I had the motivation I could recover before my goal, which is by the time I turn 19 (in under 3 months).", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/p8i69s/ive_only_regressed_in_the_month_of_august_i_dont/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "littleredrob", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9kfv0abv", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1629333221, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/p741aq/i_had_selective_mutism_as_a_kid_and_am/", "gildings": {}, "id": "p741aq", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "346468e2-937f-11e9-82f2-0eccdc050e9e", "link_flair_text": "Help", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/p741aq/i_had_selective_mutism_as_a_kid_and_am/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1629333233, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was diagnosed w selective mutism in preschool she really experience social anxiety with new people.

I'll go maybe about 10 words a day these last 2 weeks.\n\nThe motivation is dwindling and I've gone back to watching Netflix and playing Minecraft, when back in July I opted against anything that wasn't in the name of progress regarding talking. I didn't even want to write this now, but it got easier as I started to.\n\nI feel like the reaction to me talking has ramped back up as my Dad says \"I'm proud of you,\" each time I go to pick of food, and I appreciate it but it just makes me feel demotivated because I specifically informed everyone to not act a big deal over me talking or doing things. It's a big reason as to why I won't do things for myself or want to speak. There's no motivation anymore, and there's not even the motivation to tell my Mom I no longer have the motivation to speak. Although I feel like I could if I wanted to.\n\nThere is/was nothing besides it, being a little bit easier to go pick-up food, I can look back on and say I improved on during the month of August. July I can, I made HUGE leaps in regards to my mindset and I was eating better, I was exercising (doing pushups daily). Now I eat slightly worse, and have missed on the pushups (doing it about 3 days so far this month, where I did it almost daily during July).\n\nI think it has a lot to do with this girl or the reason I was motivated, I think now so much time has past I just see no hope there in regards to anything ever happening with that. I think I clung on heavily to that dream for my own motivation to speak...though now that's no longer there in my mind....and I feel like everything is just returning to how it was before July ever happened.....I wrote something the other day and it basically tells of how I've lost all motive, there's really no aspirations to my life at the current moment, other than continuing on living, for what? Idk.\n\nI was in the car going to the city this month (New York) to eat with my family and there was no real excitement or motivation boost going there, in the month of July doing something as such would give me huge motivation boosts, it felt like I was doing something, but now it's back to feeling like nothing. This is really a jumble of thoughts, but basically progress has halted, and I'm just indifferent to the fact of that. There's no real concern over my lack of progress and I feel like I should have some, or more than I do now.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 5276, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Progress has Sharply Declined Post-July (I think I feel like I failed coming out of July...because I made July 31st my goal, and that passed)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/p51rii/my_progress_has_sharply_declined_postjuly_i_think/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Even-Lavishness5251", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_90gtk33a", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1629024951, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/p4rc9a/why_do_i_have_a_fear_of_face_time_and_calls/", "gildings": {}, "id": "p4rc9a", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2efe4224-937f-11e9-9b3a-0e7080e6db1c", "link_flair_text": "General Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/p4rc9a/why_do_i_have_a_fear_of_face_time_and_calls/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1629024962, "score": 1, "selftext": "Especially when friends want to FaceTime.

Assuming the above fails, do you also lose the ability to draw to communicate?\n4. When you are not conversing with people, are there certain situations where you can't write anything in the same way as not speaking?\n5. Can you talk aloud to yourself with ease?\n6. Is the kind of anxiety that stops you from talking the same kind of fear that you see when something bad is about to happen? Or is currently happening? \n7. Say, there was a stove fire or something. You're the only one in the kitchen, you just walked in. Assuming your family are people you are comfortable talking with, do you start shouting for them or will you bang pots and pans because the fear made you mute again?\n8. How do you signal to someone that you're mute? Pointing to your throat etc\n9. Do you handle confrontation well? \n\nThese are just questions off the top of my head.

training (I help our group\u2019s camp counselor) with a group of 3-4 year olds. So obviously this is our first summer opening since Covid. With that math, these kids have literally been quarantined at home for almost half their lives.\n\n\nThis year, we have a 4 year old boy \u201cBen\u201d who is selectively mute. He only talks at home. He is the sweetest, smart, and creative. I have background educationally about selective mutism and other anxiety disorders. However, I don\u2019t have background in practice. I\u2019ve learned very quickly because our first priority is safety and making sure that he feels comfortable, and making sure that no one picks on him because he wouldn\u2019t be able to tell anyone if that was happening.\n\nIt\u2019s been going well so far, and he is actually thriving. He has taken a huge liking to me, and has become my shadow in camp. I think it\u2019s because I remind him that I\u2019m there to help keep him safe, and taking the time to sit with him if I sense something is \u201coff\u201d. We ask him yes/no questions that he can nod his answer, and he can point when given choices.\n\nIs there anything else that I could be doing? He is here all day, and all night. We are 1.5 months in and it breaks my heart that even though he seems happy with me and I\u2019m very glad he has someone he can go to, it\u2019s all just a guess. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking really, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something I could be doing something better? Prior to dropping him off, mom and dad told me that he would start talking after getting comfortable with someone.

I was able to get out of it, probably due to having less distress tho it pops up once in a while where I can't speak due to distress or start to find it difficult to speak when I'm extremely distressed. \n\nGrowing up, my sister would speak for me, so I had difficulty knowing HOW to speak. During those three years it started because I genuinely had a sudden feeling of hatred towards humans and became extremely reclusive and dissociative. \n\nIdk, I don't know if what I experienced was selective mutism because from what I am hearing is it DOESN'T go away?

I have always been curious about this transition I went through, long ago. I had classic SM during my childhood, up until puberty. It \u201ctransitioned\u201d into AvPD around that time - then I began saying around one word per week.\n\nI never received therapy when I had SM, but my GP thought I likely had it, and referred me to a child therapist. I had one session, and then my therapist moved away. I never was brought to be seen by anyone else. I\u2019m still upset pretty about this, but I really have no idea if it would have even help or not.\n\nI just have some questions, since I do hold some resentment of sorts about not receiving therapy as a kiddo. If you received therapy as a child, did it help you in any way at all? Did you ever become close enough to your therapist to actually speak aloud to them? Do you have any family history of SM.  I completely understand if you\u2019re uncomfortable answering these questions, so please do not feel pressured to answer, if it would cause you distress, or if you just don\u2019t plain want to.\n\nAt first, I resented my mom a bit for not trying harder to find a therapist after my first one left. I feel quite bad about that now.\n\nI\u2019m just curious about everyones success rate, for those who received childhood treatment. It\u2019s always haunted me.\n\nJust as with these types of anxiety disorders, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could avoid downvoting.

I didn't talk much at school and I wasn't able to order food for myself at restaurants until I was basically a teenager. I was the quiet kid, but only under specific circumstances. As I got older I came to recognize those circumstances as situations that triggered my anxiety and did everything I could do to get better at handling them. I realized that I wasn't shy, just anxious, and that I actually love to talk to people - even strangers, under the right circumstances. In my mind I function pretty well now, just the occasional spike in anxiety.  But I've been trying to build self confidence and apparently there's an area of my life where I've been letting it run rampant.\nIve been in a relationship for 11 years and...I can't talk to him. Anytime we argue or I get too emotional, I shut down and...I can't talk. I try but its like I don't have any words, I can't come up with anything worth saying, and its awful. I just end up answering all his questions with \"I don't know\" and apologizing inbetween spells of sobbing and silence. It goes without saying that this is extremely frustrating and causes a lot of problems. This whole time he hasn't been able to understand why I don't just talk to him, and has been super resistant to the idea of communicating through text. He has been especially frustrated because it literally doesn't matter how or when he approaches me, I can't verbally hold a coherent conversation with him about our issues and the negative emotions surrounding them. I have a psych degree and 4 years experience working in mental health and this whole time it never occurred to me to try and figure out why I've known this man for 11 years and still can't have a normal conversation with him about my emotions without locking up. I finally just googled it and was surprised at how quickly I found an answer. My biggest baddest demon, the one that I hate the most, can only be Selective Mutism. I don't know if having a name for it changes anything, but somehow it does comfort me to know. I've been trying to get my s/o to understand for years that my behavior is not intentional, I really can't hold a conversation with him when one or both of us is upset and emotional discussions are difficult for me regardless. I sent him some things to read and talked to him a little about it and he seemed supportive, so hopefully in the future he can be more understanding and we can better connect. \n\nIn the meantime, do yall have any advice? \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3197, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Finally figured it out", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/g4n4hw/finally_figured_it_out/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "yayana", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_147qpd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1587350792, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/g4ksy7/i_became_an_online_intern_and_need_80_clicks_on/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g4ksy7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "346468e2-937f-11e9-82f2-0eccdc050e9e", "link_flair_text": "Help", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/g4ksy7/i_became_an_online_intern_and_need_80_clicks_on/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1587350793, "score": 1, "selftext": "hi hi i'm a fellow selective mutism sufferer.. well used to be.

She started school unable to communicate with anyone there.  I had her diagnosed privately bc I knew something was different.  Sometimes even I don't get her \"words\" even though I am mommy.\n\nShe's now in 4th grade, I addressed with the teacher day one as always.   Her teacher said she understood and would work with her.  I wish that was the case.\n\nHer teacher has given her lower grades for lack of class participation, I have contacted the teacher when she doesn't understand the subject she can't ask for help so I have to tell the teacher if she doesn't understand, I know how to get math answers but not the current format they want the work shown in.\n\nMy daughter was even brave enough to write her teacher a letter explaining that she gets \"stage fright\" trying to talk in front of the class or directly to her teacher.  My amazing little girl asked if she could have a notebook to write notes back and forth with her teacher, but the teacher didn't follow through.\n\nWe spend about 2 hours a day on homework and she's genuinely not learning at school.  My daughter has begged to be homeschooled this entire school year.\n\nShe does do cheerleading, does the cheers, moves her lips, but in between when the other girls talk she is frozen like a statue.  She loves it as long as she doesn't stand out.\n\nI am disabled so I don't feel like I am able to provide enough if I homeschool long term and also worry about the social impact as I think she has a chance of making an out of school friend at some point.\n\nI know some teachers are better and work with her more than the current one.  There aren't enough hours a day to get her any type of regular therapy.  As it is she misses extra school bc she can't advocate for herself and ask to go to the nurse.

I should be a senior right now but im a junior because they thought i was autistic or something else. But being put with special ed school i was nothing like them so they put me back into regular. Through out school i would be mute and not speak at all. And sometimes of my life i would talk if i was comfortable. I remember i would be so talkative at times then switch back to mute and i dont know why i was like that. I really dont know why i was like that as a kid other than i was shy..? Now middle school i susprising made friends while i was a mute and i was in a friend group. All i did was shrug and nod and shake my head. Then i got to the point where i wrote on paper and show it to them to speak with them. Wtf. I had no problem typing and writing and stuff but speaking yes i had a problem with. Whyyyyy? At the start of high school i realized i was getting to confortable not talking and i knew thats not what i wanted to be. With family i was so talkative you wouldnt even notice i was shy. I knew i wasnt like this deep down so i started to talk in school. I started slow but talking more quietly and people were suprised because i would never talk. It feels like i just started a social journey or something because i would never talk. I actually feel like a person because im actually talking now and not just spectating. And i feel so good after talking to someone. I get that burst of energy after talking to someone. Of course im still kinda shy and awkward today but not as i used to be. I still dont know why i was still a mute because it doesn't feel like im the person to be a mute. My mom told me i wasnt the same and started being a mute after the 1 month coma i went through when i was 1 years old so i wondered if i have this or something else happened. The thing is i feel like ive overcame my and fear of talking. I looked up you cant grow out of this and i see people in the sub saying that they relapsed and stuff. I dont see myself relapsing though. Im kinda worried about that happening though because i wonder if i have this. I feel so stupid at my past self for being a mute all these years at school. Heres the thing i was talkative at home and willing to talk at places like stores and stuff.

I still haven't been to therapy because I can't afford it. I still don't talk much. I talk to my parents and my younger cousins, but I still don't really talk to the rest of my family.\n\nMy parents are the main ones that make me uncomfortable. I can't talk to anyone else when my parents are there, not even my cousins. If we're at a restaurant, my parents will literally order my food for me because I can't talk.

The thing is that I used to be a talkative kid when I was 3-7, after that I became completely shut off to any other people than my family due to some childhood trauma. My circle of people that I'm comfortable with is very small, and I am unable to make new friends because I become very withdrawn and anxious in social situations. Talking to doctors and teachers is a nightmare. My mind isn't even blank when they ask me a question and I actually might know what I should exactly say, but the words just cannot come out of my mouth. Teachers are actually becoming really fed up with me because sometimes I cannot even give them one/two word answers and all I'm capable of doing is shrugging my shoulders. If I'm in a classroom full of other people, speaking is basically impossible because it puts even more pressure and anxiety on me. Preparing myself mentally for those situations doesn't help, I am never able to express myself anyway. I have no friends in my own class and sometimes I need help with my work and I am unable to complete it because I just can't bring myself to ask anyone to help me, so I just rather sit there and I do nothing, and so I get no work done. Teachers are certainly mad. And just basically any social interaction makes me go mute even though I have things on my mind.  \n\n\nThe thing is...\n\nI'm so social with people I know. I have no problem talking to them almost about anything. I have few friends in school, and they like me because we can just discuss all kinds of topics.. generally anyone who knows me better seems to like me and they think I'm talkative.\n\nSo I don't really get what's wrong with me. I've never been diagnosed with anything (never went to get diagnosed), I believed for a long time that I might be on the autism spectrum, but I feel like if I were there I'd have problems communicating in any occasion with anyone.

But for quite some time I was unable to speak to my parents and siblings, except for one, who I'd respond to. I was really afraid of them and I'd been relentlessly picked on by everyone so I just stopped talking so as to give them nothing to throw back at me. It didn't really stop there, though, because my parents would make threats if I wouldn't speak. Even then, I mostly just nodded or gave \"yes/no\" as replies. Still, all of that drove me to self-harm and I think that was one of the most traumatizing moments of my life.  \n\n\nI no longer had a desire to speak. I stopped at school, too, although that was more short-lived -- I didn't want to get into any more trouble because I was deathly afraid of the consequences. I wanted to be perfect and invisible at the same time so that nobody would ever bother me. So I returned to speaking while in school and just dealt with it. I didn't really have friends IRL but I had plenty online and so that was okay; I never had to speak around them, although I did once every few months when I felt ready.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today .. I still rarely speak. I'll respond when spoken to, but I don't really like it. Often times there are conversations going on around me and even if I have something to say and sort of want to add to it .. I just respond in my head over and over until someone addresses me specifically or the topic changes and the opportunity is lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I read this it sounds like I'm just really anxious and socially avoidant, and I think that's true, but also -- I don't want to speak. Period. The only reason I do is because I'm more afraid of the consequences of not speaking than I am of using my voice .. Additionally .. it feels as though I'm doing a disservice to those who truly cannot speak due to some physical issue. For those reasons I feel ashamed to claim that I am mute and instead just go out of my way to only ever be around the few people I feel comfortable speaking around (or who will primarily speak for me) and if I can't manage that then I won't do anything at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI often wish I was simply born mute with some physical condition so that it was simple and irrefutable. But instead I feel I have to speak or I will fail as a person because there's no documentation suggesting that I need assistance; I won't pass my classes, people will dislike me, I may lose financial support from my parents. On top of that .. I don't want anyone to recognize me and force me to speak because they know that I physically can. That's truthfully one of my biggest concerns. I suspect if I ever move I may try to start my life as a full-time mute but .. regardless .. these are the details I want to record for you people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not really sure where this places me and there are plenty of things I could add (like how sometimes I feel okay to talk around certain people while most of the time I don't) but .. I didn't want this to be so lengthy that it was a deterrent. I'm not diagnosed with anything, given my financial situation, and as such I am here on reddit trying to figure things out for myself. Let me know what you think. If you have any specific questions then you are welcome to ask or DM me ..   \n\n\nThank you : )", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3032, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm not sure if I have SM or not, but I know I don't want to speak", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/fdasgx/im_not_sure_if_i_have_sm_or_not_but_i_know_i_dont/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Mariana499", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_57fukhhw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1583279901, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/fd42qz/does_anyone_have_any_general_advice_about_how_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fd42qz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/fd42qz/does_anyone_have_any_general_advice_about_how_to/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1583279907, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3031, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "does anyone have any general advice about how to live with selective mutism when there are very few people you can talk to?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/fd42qz/does_anyone_have_any_general_advice_about_how_to/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AlienMissy483", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5mi9e0vf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582988185, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/fbdluh/need_someone_to_talk_with/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fbdluh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "594f96b2-93ad-11e9-a981-0e7bb0e60cfc", "link_flair_text": "Announcement", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/fbdluh/need_someone_to_talk_with/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1582988187, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just wanted to say that if anyone is struggling with selective mutism and need someone to talk with, feel free to message me:)(I'm new to reddit..  you can message people here, right?\ud83d\ude02).

It is a disorder known for being incredibly difficult to treat and there are very few specialists available [Noelle](https://imgur.com/a/1RDpH6s)in the United States. If improperly treated, Selective Mutism can persist into adulthood and leave a person severely disabled for their entire life.\n\nFor the first eight years of Noelle\u2019s life she only spoke with my husband and I, and two of her best girl friends. She would not speak at school. Over many yrs she worked with countless Psychologists and Therapists with little to no progress. The only specialist in this area of expertise I found was a Psychologist in Pennsylvania for $400 an hour who was treating through video chat. This would have bankrupted us! I realized as Noelle was approaching 10 yrs old that we were entering \u201cthe point of no return\u201d and this would become a permanent lifelong issue if not resolved quickly. Time was of the essence! \n\nIt was at this point I decided to take matters into my own hands. I fired the Therapist who had been working were her at our home and read a half dozen books on Selective Mutism to gain more knowledge of the condition and write up a treatment plan. I felt empowered during this time and hopeful that my treatment plan would be successful. The Summer of 2004 I worked with Noelle daily and viligiantly. All of her small steps up the social phobia ladder all added up to big leaps forward. By the end of the Summer she was calling up family members and grandparents who had never heard her voice before and conversing with them for the first time. She was now able to speak normally outside of the school setting. She however still refused to speak at school. I knew children need to be treated at both home and school separately and that this would be the biggest hurdle to overcome because she had never had a teacher that was willing to invest in helping her overcome Selective Mutism. I desperately needed the cooperation of a willing teacher. \n\nWhen Noelle started 4th grade with Ms. Henry It was obvious that we had finally met the teacher that would be able to help Noelle overcome this great obstacle. Shannon immediately took an interest in Noelle and her disability and made it her number one goal that year to get Noelle speaking in class. I provided a book about Selective Mutism the first day I met Shannon and she immediately read it and studied Selective Mutism on her own time.  Shannon and I worked together to write out a classroom treatment plan for Noelle in taking steps towards being able to talk in class. She allowed me to take videos of Noelle speaking to the class from home and show them to the students. Shannon also worked with Noelle after school with several other students throughout the year in helping her to be able to talk to them. She also came to my home on various occasions to work with Noelle. Great gains were made early on. Gradually Noelle improved over the course of the year and she eventually was able to talk inside and outside of the classroom. By the end of the year a miracle occurred and Noelle was able to give a speech in front of her class. \n\nNoelle is almost 14 years old now! She is a social butterfly and is constantly getting in trouble for socializing too much in class. She was recently voted \u201cmost popular\u201d at her school!

You've helped our family immensely and now I have a bit of a burning question. \n\nMy stepson was diagnosed with selective mutism at the age of 4. He has progressed through things enormously well and has coping strategies he uses in particular scenarios. Recently, he has started to verbalize frustration and anger and grumpiness out loud in a way that we have never seen before! We are overjoyed to see the same reactions at home happening at school. We know it's a HUGE step! \n\nHowever, he is starting to snap and shut down when he has a hard time verbalizing what is going on, even at home. And it's starting to negatively affect his relationships with his classmates. \n\nI don't want to push him too much, but at the same time I'm wondering what things you would have wished your parents would have done when you were experiencing those strong emotions.\n\nWhat kind of actions or words can I incorporate into my doing (as well as encourage the other adults in his life to do) to help him make sense of how he is feeling? \n\nAny insight you could offer would be appreciated!

Ever since around that time me, my mom, and my sister have pretty much went for a check up about every 3 months to see our therapist. I obviously have to tell my mom before if I have any concerns with my medications or anything so she can tell him. He and my mom both still try to get me to talk but every time I still get choked up  and want to cry just thinking about it. I\u2019m used to seeing him though and he\u2019s a really nice guy so I wish I could but I don\u2019t see that ever happening. I also was seeing a counselor weekly at one point after I attempted suicide once, and I wasn\u2019t able to talk to her either, so mostly her and my mom mostly talked about irrelevant stuff which did absolutely nothing. But currently, I\u2019ve been dealing with different issues (depression, starting college, possibly BPD) and I feel like I\u2019m in desperate need of a counselor or therapist. I pushed myself to move an hour away for college (big step for me) so I\u2019m not even sure where to start looking for people but I think I need to ask help from my mom, which is another problem. I don\u2019t know if this is a typical SM thing but in addition to not being to talk to people I don\u2019t know at all, talking about my deep feelings or emotions with the people I am comfortable with breaks me down. When I first told my mom about my concern about my depression (which I had been holding in for years) I had to cry immediately. I worry that if I bring up the idea of me seeing someone else she\u2019ll ask me for more details which I really don\u2019t want to provide, because the last thing I want to do is make her worry about me. That\u2019s also obviously going to get in the way of an appointment if I do find a counselor, how am I going to be able to talk about anything? I\u2019ve considered the idea of typing what I want to say because it would be easier to physically do, but I eventually do want to try to be able to communicate my emotions freely and not have to rely on some other way, because like my therapist at home, if I typically don\u2019t talk to someone for an extended period of time then I feel even more scared to talk because I expect them to get excited or surprised if I do talk and expect more from me. Because of this I can\u2019t talk to my uncle. My college already has free counseling services but they\u2019re packed and I\u2019m already on the waitlist, but I don\u2019t expect them to contact me anytime soon, so I think I have to find a place off campus. So yeah I think that\u2019s all my info, not sure if this was mostly a rant to explain my situation, but I would really appreciate some support and help (just found this subreddit).

Anyways, I thought pretty deeply about it. In the end I seemed to care a lot less about the money I could earn as a nurse, compared to as a teacher... and I cared more about the job itself. I hate school for about half the time I spent in it, starting from middle school. I was often depressed, and my anxiety caused a whole lot of social isolation. The SM didn't help, either. I'm mostly recovered now, I guess? I still have a ton of anxiety and can't talk to the people who know me as the girl who can't talk, but I can talk to strangers, children, and all of my coworkers. \n\nI thought of how many of my teachers weren't helpful; either they added to my anxiety and depression or were too passive to care too much about my condition.\n\nI thought back to the time when I was in the fifth grade and met a little boy in Kindergarten who hadn't spoken at school all year. I knew exactly how he was feeling. At the time I didn't know about SM, so I couldn't let any of the confused staff know what was going on.\n\nI thought back to all the jokes, lectures, and other different treatment I received from my teachers and peers.\n\nAnd I thought that I didn't want to be like that. I want to be the teacher who does exactly what their students need. I want to be a safe, welcoming person at school. I want to allow children to love school. I want to be able identify SM in young children before they grow up and it becomes so much more harder for them to recover. I want to be able to positively impact all children, regardless of whether they have anxiety or not. I want them to be able to enjoy school and their youth.\n\nAt the same time, I've always enjoyed tutoring. I love to offer my help to friends when they're stuck on a math problem. History, sociology, psychology, all the different sciences (except physics), algebra (no geometry because ew math with shapes)!! I love learning about all of those!! I love sharing my knowledge with others!! I like helping others!! So that's also why I decided to become a teacher.\n\nSo I decided to become a teacher. I know what to do based off my own experiences, but my experiences are not the world's... so I'd like to know some things you wished teachers did. It can be for anxiety or any other condition or problem you had. What do you wish teachers did for you and/or others?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 1778, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm pursuing a career in early childhood education.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572185588, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/dlcjoi/im_pursuing_a_career_in_early_childhood_education/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "P00ld3ad", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "0ab735ee-8171-11e9-8a25-0ef95564d0f4", "author_flair_text": "Diagnosed SM - Community Mod", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3haoejov", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571419524, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/djqqnc/this_is_a_selective_mutism_descriptive_essay_i/", "gildings": {}, "id": "djqqnc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "6cd45b88-937f-11e9-b949-0e8f494fb2b0", "link_flair_text": "Meta", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/djqqnc/this_is_a_selective_mutism_descriptive_essay_i/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571419525, "score": 68, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 1762, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "This is a Selective Mutism descriptive essay I recently made for school.

But I've never been diagnosed with anything other than depression and anxiety. I used to be completely unable to talk to strangers, but after six plus years of work in the food industry I can now barely make small talk with people.\n\nThe only time I can really open up is when I've been drinking. And I obviously can't drink all the time. I feel like the isolation I experience allows my mind to play all kinds of tricks on me. And sometimes my perspective seems to be distinct from reality. Possibly co-morbid borderline or bipolar idk.\n\nId like to blame my lack of meaningful progress on my parents. I don't have money to go to therapy. I have a hard time even supporting myself. My mom paid for therapy once, but I missed the appointment. And now she said she's already tried with me and won't pay for therapy again.\n\nI have insurance. But my insurance has been accepted and then later declined so many times, leaving me to have to pay for every session.\n\nI live on my own and most people would see me as independent. But the lack of communication I experience makes me oscillate between extremely low self esteem and insecure arrogance. All of this happening on the inside. I'm too ashamed of those feelings to be open about them.\n\nSometimes I'll develop a crush on a girl, but then I'll just try to forget about those feelings all together. Because I know I can't approach her, and I know no one wants to be attached to the mute kid. I've tried to accept that I'll probably be lonely most of my life. It's hard though.\n\nFeel like I want to get better, but no one even sees a problem. People constantly make me think I'm doing this to myself, and I can choose to stop whenever I want. I guess I'm just too dumb to change or something. Idk. That's the way people act. Like if you want to stop then just stop.\n\nI'm so jealous of other guys that can make friends easily. Or can talk to girls without seeming like a scared child. I feel like their lives must be so fulfilling. It's easier to be alone if I'm pretending to be doing it on purpose.

It was so painful to talk around people I wasn\u2019t comfortable with which was pretty much everyone except my immediate family and a few very close friends.  \n\nMy mind would \u201cshut off\u201d and I couldn\u2019t get words out no matter how hard I tried. I also had separation anxiety which started at age 3 when I started pre-school and I also had/have mild speech problems (which I read are both associated with SM). My family thought I was just shy and for awhile I thought I was too, although I knew there was something deeper going on.

I hope at least one of you will read. Thank you. \n\nThis is my rant response to someone who said I sound crazy based on my posts (I only am spreading love, truth and awareness so please don't just brush my message of as crazy). Someone who said they think I need to go see a therapist. I kind of laughed out loud because I have seen several and NOW people say I should. Not when I should have gotten a proper therapist/social worker to help me understand my gift. Anyway. Love to you all. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI actually can't stop speaking now. \n\nAnd people seem to want to listen, for real. r/blind is the Reddit thread where people see the world the most real and those are really intelligent people, they listen. They care.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_mutism\n\nRead up on it a little, it is only the top of the iceberg however because like it says, no cause is really known for real. How could it be? When noone listens to those who have it.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/d8htso/intense_world_autistic_brains_create_42_more/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nHypersensitive people who can't shut their brain or heart off. \n\nI hope you mean well with your comment, but please educate yourself before writing. Sensitive people can think you have an actual idea of what you're talking about, but you don't. &lt;--- Directed at the commentor who said I should see a therapist because I write \"love \u2764\ufe0f\" after sentences. \n\nWhere is the world at, that I am crazy for trying to spread love? For always saying the truth or rather not speaking at all.\n\nI have seen maybe 10 different therapists/psychologist my entire life and none of them in my childhood, even though that's when I was completely mute in school. \n\nThis wasn't by conscious choice, I was only a small child trying not to get yelled at or looked at funny because I was telling the truth or seeing the beauty in the world around me. \n\nYou think these are strange things that I am posting? I always thought the fact that you who never once asked yourself \"why is this small child hiding under couches and choosing not to/ unable to speak from fear of hurting others or having to be looked at strangely another time?\"\nI find those people more strange than me. Those who don't seem to even think about it?\n\nDo you ever leave your own reality? Because every single person has their own you know.\n\nNow I have had 10 since I turned 13 and refused to go to school anymore. I locked myself in my room. I didn't speak to my mother anymore. I didn't want her to even look at me. I was confused. I didn't feel like I had a choice. Now you see, imagine being someone ultra sensitive in a world of rocks bashing against you. Imagine that you are in someone else's shoes. \n\nNow, I was never diagnosed. They simply thought I was the strange one I guess my entire childhood. Every adult, every teacher, every classmate.\n\nSo from 13, years, when I completely crashed, unable to leave my room even for weeks, I have had maybe 10 different therapists, they would circulate because everyone was moving to Stockholm for work. They never had the time to get to know me. The only person who even mentioned Asperger's was a newly graduated young man who asked if I wanted to take an IQ test. I did. I had Asperger's. I am amazed at myself for even doing the test. I had refused to ear properly for weeks, I couldn't sleep. A doctor said a few years later my iron levels were so low that he was surprised I could even stand up, if I had been an adult I would have been unable to get out of bed. Exhausted, drained, without food, without sleep, without anyone who would listen, I took a test and he said I did amazingly great. He hadn't been able to drag anything out of me but maybe he saw my eyes that kept glancing at the corner. That I was scared to look him in the eyes to see how he thought I was crazy. I have lost count for how many I saw but only 3 of them did any good, the others caused me more harm. They told my mom to unscrew the door to my room. I never got to have any sense of privacy or safety. But I pulled through. Despite them. The drugs they pushed down my throat made me want to die. I was cutting all over my arms. Noone still would listen. Years of this shit.\n\nI pulled through despite everyone else seemingly (they do not mean harm, they just don't have the awareness you do.) wanting me not to.\n\n(I repeat! They do NOT mean harm, they just don't have the awareness you do. We need to spread it. I will do my best.)\n\nWell except the young graduate, he seemed to really care and understand. He had to move to Stockholm though.\n\nHere I am 10 years later, still breathing,\nAnd I feel confused looking around. \n\nHow am I always the most energetic in the room?\n\nWhy am I the one singing in the buss, drumming to my music. Closing my eyes in the rays of the sun?\n\nMaybe because I had to cope with the fact that I only had myself against the world, only needed myself and that safety. I don't know. I know now I want to join the world to spread awareness. Because we should learn how to treat people like people. You deserve to be treated \"normal\" and you deserve to speak. You have so many brilliant ideas and thoughts. I want to listen.\n\nI want to listen. You are not crazy, you are not weird. You are not. You are amazingly unique. \n\nSo after that entire horrible journey, I have finally at 23 years of age emerged strong as a fucking diamond. From all the pressure. And I have some brilliant ideas to fix this world.\n\nFinally being an honest person had some sort of golden lining.\n\nThe recent therapist, I saw a few months ago, she was the best one yet, she actually finished my healing from the trauma of my childhood forced mutism by my surroundings. She wasn't a therapist, she was just a social worker. She gave me so many good strategies to think about with coping with stress. \n\nI am normal today. I speak the most in class, I write the most online. I see myself as 100% healthy. It's the world that needs help. \n\nIf you read through this entire post, then I applaud you. You managed to stare the through in the face. I want the world to change for the 1% of kids like me, who aren't even diagnosed, no help, but they get treated like shit. By people who look at them like they are crazy when they are just honest and very sensitive to emotions. They think all night, they ponder existential questions. They want to know how to help their family not scream and lie.\n\nI am happy, I will never be silenced again. If I go mute again this time it is by choice, because I want to be a voice for those kids, teenagers, adults, elderly. \n\nAwareness. Love. Acceptance. Tribe.

But what nobody seemed to realize is when i told people \"I can't talk\" they'd tell me \"What do you mean you mean you're scared?\" and i'd say yes, but i can't talk. Oh it's anxiety, oh it happens sometimes you're fine. But i wasn't just not talking because i was scared i latterly couldn't' talk. i'm not sure how nobody understood when i said no i can't talk but they didn't. My voice would stop, it was like it became frozen even when i wanted to speak really badly nothing came out. Sometimes i could say hi but that was rare. And even if i managed to say hi after it was frozen and there was nothing. I would often get called \"mute\" and asked if i could talk. called weird and the worst part was i couldn't get myself to say \"No i'm not mute\" I couldn't even say stop i couldn't defend myself with words because i couldn't get my voice to work.

But i wanted to post this because i guess i never got to tell anyone who understood, i never got to explain \"Why\" and those who i told never listened. I didn't even know this existed until i saw a video online that explained my whole life in a single clip.

I was a really \"shy\" kid. I literally did not want talk to anyone who wasn't family. And even then it was usually just simple, short responses or even just grunts or noises of acknowledgement. I got a bit better as I grew up, but up til 1st grade I only had one friend. Then I moved States and had to start over, and was surprisingly doing better? I was always wary at school, I had a speech impediment so I whenever I had to speak in front of class I shut down, and if I was forced to speak I was quiet and shaky. I made a few friends, but I was always \"the quiet one.\"\nMy home situation stayed the same as before, usually only talking when spoken to and short responses or noises. It's still like that to today, though sometimes I can manage a conversation (even starting one!) If it's about something I care about.\nSo I seemed to be getting better, I couldn't talk to strangers, that was just about it. I could talk to less known people when prompted with short responses.\nBut then I just... Stalled there. I haven't really moved on from that point. I had a lot of familial drama around when I was 11, and by the time I was 14 or 15 I was diagnosed with Depression and Generalized Anxiety, though now several other additional diagnoses are being thought about, BPD being the main one.\nSo. That's basically my story, so here's my question. Is that selective mutism or just... Regular old social anxiety? Somedays my mental health is worse and so is my mutism. When I'm distressed or have to talk about serious things or my mental health (like in therapy or with my mom) I shut down again and can't speak. In situations that aren't like that I can usually speak to my therapist or mom fine, I just have to be prompted first.\nOh I suppose I should add there's moments when I'm better at speaking to strangers, I can strangle out a few words when prompted, but I think that's because I was on depression/anxiety medication (that worked) at the time.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 1524, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I think I have selective mutism?

Around Grade 3 I think I was ready to speak out loud but I was worried that my classmates would ask too many questions if I suddenly started speaking so I transferred schools for a fresh start.

For instance, I have a bad habit of letting people talk for me, especially in uncomfortable social situations, like ordering food, or talking to family friends. I know I'm a quieter person because of it, although my teachers loved me for that, so I'm a little proud of my self regulation, even if it means I speak a bit more softly. I know that I'm an anxious person (I refuse to self diagnose myself with anxiety) but I can't tell if it's an abnormal amount of anxiety or the regular amount of stress.

"retrieved_on": 1606845021, "score": 1, "selftext": "First off, SM is new to me so idrk much. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo, usually I can talk to people face-to-face, because I think the fear of their response to me not talking overrides the fear of talking. But I CANNOT text people, call people (unless it's my parents or siblings), or talk about certain topics.\n\nMost sources I saw about SM say that people who have it usually cannot talk to superiors, people they are unfamiliar with, or oftentimes other people in general, when in uncomfortable places like school or social gatherings. This is only true for me with texting and calling.\n\nI cannot talk to my closest friends about very specific topics, even when I've been with them all night. (I only have two friends because my brain can only work with one at a time unless we are all physically together) The topics I can't speak for are very personal, and my vocal cords shut off completely. No sound will come out unless the topic is not on my personal experience. It includes things like traumatic experiences or things that will reveal anything remotely concerning about me. If the focus is changed on the other person, then I will most likely be able to respond unless flashbacks get in the way of it. This becomes worse with my parents.\n\nI will ghost friends even though I feel sick with guilt. I don't understand, texting someone back shouldn't be difficult. It is likely that I will ghost one friend while communicating regularly with the other, then it swaps. I sound like a real jack*** right now but I can't explain the inner workings of it. Strangers and other family will not be responded to and it's also difficult to respond to my dad.\n\nAnd lastly, calling people. I had a major panic attack ordering pizza. I forcefully opted to order online when my friend tried to make me call to \"face my fears.\" I would've had another attack otherwise. I could barely call my boyfriend to talk to him, texting him physically hurt. He wasn't mean or anything. (Ex now, literally because of my communication issues)\n\nI think I've explained the basics. I've gone through abuse and neglect for a major portion of my life so there's that. I feel so guilty about literally everything. Obviously there's something more than just SM if anything, but I'm slowly trying to fit puzzle pieces together here. Basically, I'm TERRIFIED of people's responses.\n\nOne more thing, I am more likely to be able to talk about those topics with complete strangers. But, if the relationship goes even barely beyond surface level, then it will stop.

It does flair up sometimes, but for the most part I talk when I want to talk now, which is very nice. The way I started talking was by observing how I was okay with talking to my parents, and trying to figure out how to apply that to other situations. The things I observed were that 1. I didn't care what they thought because I didn't feel I would be rejected, or if I was I would survive and nothing bad would happen, and 2. I never internally filtered what I was saying.\n\nThe first few times were pretty awful, but I knew that when you only say 1 thing and you screw it up, you've screwed up 100% of your speech, wheras if you say 100 things and screw up 1 thing, you've only screwed up 1% of your speech. So I knew it would get easier because the stakes would get lower and lower. \n\nBasically the result was that I removed the filter, and I said things as soon as they entered my head. The result was that I overshared a ton, I said a lot of boneheaded things, but I gained a lot of confidence and a comfort level that really helped me. Now I'm having problems in my relationship with my husband where as soon as I think before I speak, I end up mute again. So the result is I either become not at all communicative, or I can be extremely tactless, abrasive, hurtful, and dominating of the conversation. My therapist suggested I add in a pause before saying things, which is very hard for me because it triggers the mutism. I've been trying though. There have been moments where words are flowing despite the pauses, but as soon as the conversation becomes stressful, I clam up or I go full motormouth and dominate the conversation.\n\nHave any of you dealt with this?

Last year when she was in kindergarten the teacher was amazing and worked with her through her \"shyness\" but this year her teacher is a little less patient and keeps trying to find quick solutions to Josie's problems which is frustrating her mom. Josie would nod yes or no and could complete any school work that she was given but would not verbally answer questions. She is very intelligent but does not speak to adults that are not her parents. I was browsing through Google wondering if there were games or activities that would help with Josie's speech anxiety and Google gave me a link to \"how to treat selective mutism\". So I started reading and was shocked at how the article hit the nail on the head when describing what Josie was going through. I should also mentioned that her family is bilingual. Her family does not have the financial means to put her into speech therapy. What activities or home therapy can you all suggest for her parents or perhaps for myself since she does not verbally speaking to me. she will walk up to me and show me her boo boo that she got that day or a picture that she colored but will not speak.

I had always struggled through school, couldn't talk etc would cover my mouth and whisper if I could get anything out. I had struggled to go to school since I started at four years old but the need to be compliant and do the right thing was greater than the need to \n\nHigh school was a real struggle and I got worse and moved high school a few times without moving house. The final high school I had friends before I started having a common interest in playing Warhammer Quest and various RPGs. I also had full time support to help make it in any way accessible (I know that now there would be no way someone would get full time support one to one). I ended up only taking 6 GCSEs passing 5 (all science based) as I had dropped out of everything else because teachers would expect me to talk.\n\nAnyways I stumbled through life, been to 4 universities started 4 different undergraduate courses, graduated from ceramics. Ceramics gave me some leeway in talking to strangers as long as it was about art or ceramics.\n\nThen I have postgraduate teaching qualification (which I was almost bullied out of due to struggling with SM throughout). And got my Masters by research as I somehow convinced the university to give me a grant to pay for my tuition. \n\nAlways found work through knowing someone, worked for family a few times, never got a job through interview. The last job I had was making me increasingly ill over the four years that I did it and I finally managed to quit this year. Next day I did my back in and spent a month not being able to stand for more than 5 minutes or sit up at my computer. \n\nSince then I have been pushing to try and make what was a side business of teaching ceramics occasionally (the teaching side is dead in the water until covid is over) and selling what I make. I finally have had time to work on getting that going. My SM does make it hard to write about my work and I have been trying my hardest, but the last few years SM has affected my ability to even post on social media. I have been getting around it this last month by joining everything together on Facebook business and writing all my posts for the week on the day I feel the bravest and just scheduling as much as I can manage till I feel tired.\n\nI have run a business before but I failed due to finding it hard to always having to fight through SM as people came into the shop.\n\nRecently I wrote a fan letter to an artist hero who had through his writing and youtube films had helped me to gather up the courage to quit my job, and I had explained from the onset about SM but most people don't understand. He invited me to join his mentoring course which I decided to try it out. As I went through the classes and the worksheets he had written I started feeling more like myself, braver pushing my work which I haven't managed to do all year. I have been on the course for 3 weeks and I finally managed to muster the courage to ask a question which was  basically \"How do I ask better questions? I struggle to answer questions if they are non factual. And what questions should I be asking of myself?\"\n\nThe response boiled down to:\n\n* live from imagination not history. \n* You have to be able to be the fool, \n* always exploring. \n* Why do I always need to be right\n* Find the source of that pain that makes you this way and deal with it.\n* Not going to be a great life if you always live in fear.\n\nThat was on Wednesday of this Week (now Friday) and I have been struggling to get work done I can't really think of anything else. The progress I made in the three weeks was superficial and flaking at the edges. \n\nThe origin of it all is the selective mutism I went into the sciences originally because I was good at it but also because it was factual, it meant I didn't really have to speak to a teacher I could generally just get on with it. Case in point my second high school I went to a school where we would work from workbooks in the morning in individual offices put a flag on top if we needed anything (which I never used apart from asking permission to mark my own work. And in the afternoon we would have taught lessons. Every year I teach myself a new skill because of being an independent learner. Being right has always given me something to hide behind.\n\nSM has caused me to form a persona for work, for out and about, in my business. It is very much a serious one compared to what close friends and family see of someone who messes about and sings loudly as they work, completely out of key, and has a fun time making things.  I don't know how to act the fool how to actually give myself the permission to make truely playful enjoyable work and express that to other people.\n\nI have missed so much in my life due to the SM from friends weddings to giving myself permission to work on what I really want to work on.\n\nI don't know what I want from writing all this, I just am a bit tired of going through this alone feeling like a kid that no one understands (I know I'm 36, but it doesn't make it any easier.)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3972, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "About me, I guess.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/k1zqju/about_me_i_guess/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "wowwowwow88", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6ym2fjr5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606471745, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/k1ykd8/do_kids_with_sm_often_have_adhd_are_they_often_hsp/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k1ykd8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2acf2f24-937f-11e9-b9a2-0eaa44d6d570", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/k1ykd8/do_kids_with_sm_often_have_adhd_are_they_often_hsp/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1606471756, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3972, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do kids with SM often have adhd?

I was so happy and sad at the same time to learn about it, because now my life made sense but I still don\u2019t know what to do about it. I have been diagnosed with social phobia w/panic attacks. While I haven\u2019t been diagnosed with SM, I have been experiencing the symptoms since before kindergarten (that I can remember) and continue to experience them to this day. I definitely have not outgrown it in any way, I\u2019ve just learned to live my life around it. \nAs a child I could only whisper to my grandma (who raised me) and school was terrible. I was picked on and bullied, and the only reason I was ever able to get a job was because my mom set them up for me. It really means so much to me to know I\u2019m not alone. While no one I know may understand me, there are other people out there like me! Other people who know how hard it is to get through life like this. \nI think my biggest challenge is my complete inability to go to a doctor and discuss this. I can\u2019t even pick up a phone to make an appt. Phones have always been my nemesis, it\u2019s easier now as so many things can be done online, but even the thought of talking to a doctor makes me shut down. I\u2019ve been trying to go to the doctor for a couple years for an unrelated issue, and I haven\u2019t been able to. The best I can do is get in for my prescription refills and lie to my doctor when she\u2019s asks how I am. I can\u2019t even control it, I just automatically say I\u2019m fine, nothing else to discuss. \n\nI\u2019m generally scared to even talk to people online, so I\u2019ll probably post this and run away. But I\u2019m feeling brave at the moment and I want other people to know they are not alone. \n\nI get it guys, life is hard. People don\u2019t understand. It seems so silly to not be able to talk, but it\u2019s real. It\u2019s debilitating. It\u2019s not just being shy or reserved, and you can\u2019t just get over it as some people might suggest. I have to push myself so hard everyday just to even function in normal society, but I do it. I\u2019ve found having a \u2018support person\u2019 to be the easiest way for me to navigate through life. It\u2019s extremely difficult to form relationships, so I count myself lucky that I\u2019ve been able to find people who love me for me. Unfortunately, I often ruin those relationships through my lack of communication, but somehow I\u2019ve always had at least 1 person in my life at a time who has stuck by me. \nI hope you can all find your own support people, or animals, or whatever helps you get through the day. I hope you all can go to the doctor and find some guidance. I hope you all know how wonderful you are, even if most of the world can\u2019t see it. I hope you all live good, happy lives and are able to overcome any challenges you may face. I hope you don\u2019t let SM define you, and instead challenge it and WIN!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selectivemutism", "subreddit_id": "t5_32qzw", "subreddit_subscribers": 3952, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A little about me", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/jzacfx/a_little_about_me/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "1531004", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d7bcaa30-406f-11e9-aa69-0ef85844b598", "author_flair_text": "Suspected SM", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8ai46sk7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606056616, "domain": "self.selectivemutism", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/jywsfr/just_venting/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jywsfr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "389d6cec-937f-11e9-9d30-0e6c3cf3f1f6", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/selectivemutism/comments/jywsfr/just_venting/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1606056723, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was messaging my friend and telling her about how I struggle to make friends at school,\nand about how my classmates don't really interact with me anymore.\n\nShe told my to just suck it up because I don't make the effort to communicate with them. \n\nShe knows I can't speak so she told me to use paper to communicate, but doing that makes me kinda nervous.\nI don't know why, but I get anxious when I talk to my classmates in non-verbal ways (writing on paper, messaging, etc).\n\nI did become friends with one of my classmates a few months ago by communicating with paper though.

i dont know when the psychologist will contact me, the doctor just said he will speak to one. i told my family and my sisters seem to understand, but my parents seem to underestimate the seriousness of it. also, does anyone know if stress contributes to developing social problems?

A year later, I had a traumatic experience. Since then, my selective mutism became worse, as I would stop talking to the only friend I had, without any reason. I never got help, people at middle school just ignore me and I remember that a teacher told my parents that I should see a professional as my behaviour was not normal. Obviously, my parents ignore this and even threatened me with taking me to \"a hospital for crazy people\" if I don't stop being that way. Because of this, I grow up kind of terrified until I was old enough to understand that my parents were stupid. Of course, they know nothing about my childhood trauma. Now that I'm an adult (19) I want to know about my childhood and discover why I was that way. I also have sweaty hands 24/7 and my doctor said that it could be related to an anxiety disorder, as I have many symptoms of it. I want to understand why I was silent for 8 years and why I still struggle with social settings. \n\nI feel like I'm making assumptions but I want to read your experiences. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I want to know if anyone here had the same experience as me and how you overcome that in adulthood?
