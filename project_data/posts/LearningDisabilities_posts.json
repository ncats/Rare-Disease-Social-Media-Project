There was no need of this.  I do things a little differently.  I explained that.  I explained I had been diagnosed as spatially disabled back in high school. Work asked for a workup.  \n\nThe doctor is fascinated.  I was a reporter for 20 years  -- a good one -- and attempted PR at a transit agency.  I covered traffic at one point, but he said, don't.  Your gifts are not there. He said I was 'extraordinary' when it comes to verbal and written skills, as well as memory and general knowledge.  I have no college degree -- could never afford it.  \n\nVisual-spatial, motor skills, walking and chewing gum at the same time?  A NIGHTMARE.  I cannot assemble a puzzle. \n\nI had no idea social skills were wrapped up in this.  No wonder I'm a nerd.  My tendency to interrogate people as conversation plays into this.

been dependent on extra time on my assignments and tests. However, I would still do assignments at the last or get stressed out when I do a test. I'm in graduate school and so far, I haven't asked for any assistance. The main reason I struggled so long with school work was because I was aware that I process things at a slower rate, which made me feel inferior to my classmates. I felt stupid compare to them. It also didn't help that my parents would insult my intelligence even though they were informed about my learning disability.\n\nI think that the reason why I'm doing well now in graduate school is because I accepted the fact that I did process information slower than other people.

I have ADHD that went undiagnosed until adulthood mostly because I was always a good student (so my teachers thought.)  The symptoms have always been there, I just happen to be smarter than the average bear, so I've coped well.  Anyway, learning that I have ADHD and getting help has been life changing for me, so I want to try and find help for my wife as well.  I'm having a hard time figuring out where to start though, since I'm not objective enough to tell whether she actually has a problem, or if she's just normal (or slightly below average) and I just think she's slow compared to myself (extremely high IQ.)  Just looking for advice and an objective opinion here.\n  \nHere are the symptoms I've noticed:\n  \n**Memory problems**  \n- She'll constantly ask the same question 3 or more times within a 5 minute period because she can't remember that she already asked &amp; got an answer.  \n- If she's learning a new task, (say cooking a simple meal like Mac &amp; Cheese) as long as she does it every day, she gets pretty good.  If after 2 months she skips a day or two, we're back at square 1.  \n- Nothing ever ends up put away in the same place twice.  Color coding and label makers help somewhat.  \n- We've been working on studying for her driver's license, but by the time we get to the end of a chapter in the book, she can't remember the previous chapter.  \n  \n**Attention Problems**  \n- Jumps from topic to topic so fast no one can keep up.  \n- Interrupts mid conversation with a different topic  \n- Runs into people &amp; things with strollers, shopping cart, etc. because she sees something distracting  \n- Can't stay focused on a task long enough to complete it without someone nagging her  \n- Loses stuff CONSTANTLY.  She has 4 cellphones because she'll lose one and I just activate the next one in rotation.  They always turn up in a shoe she hasn't worn in a while or in the couch eventually.  \n  \n**School Problems**  \n- Terrible at math.  I think a large part of why she can't cook is because she can't handle fractions at all.  \n- Was in remedial group once, but that's where her school stuck all the druggies and misfits, so her mom insisted they put her back with the other kids.  \n- D student all through school, but did great in VoTech  \n- Really struggles to learn anything new  \n- Has never really liked reading because it's hard for her  \n  \n**Miscellaneous**  \n- Has struggled with depression  \n- Her mom is borderline abusive (gaslighting, extremely controlling, very possessive, think Rapunzel's mom from Tangled) which might have screwed with her memory.  \n- Really struggles with finding her way around, gets lost easily  \n- Shopping of any kind, esp grocery shopping is overwhelming  \n- Ruins things because she forgets what she's doing (ie. adding bleach to colors, uses metal scraper on teflon pans, etc.)  \n- Not too long ago the dentist gave her Rx for Hydrocodone as needed and an antibiotic to be taken every day for a root canal.  She about destroyed her liver and lived in a haze for a week because she switched the dosing instructions.  \n- Just generally struggles to take care of herself and \"adult.\"  Think stereotypical rich spoiled college freshman bachelor levels of \"adulting\" skills.  She's really good at cleaning, as long as someone else does the organizing.  \n  \nAnyway, I'm not sure where to start.  We were thinking of going to a normal therapist to work through some of the depression and anger management issues she has to start, but I think maybe testing for a learning disability and getting help for it will solve the other problems.

I've developed coping mechanisms, but mostly I've just overcompensated in other areas to hide it.  (For example, I tested at a post-grad reading level in 4th grade and was put into a \"Gifted and Talented\" program.

This is going to be aimed towards people with short term memory problems or working memory.\n\nFirst tip: If you have to remember where somewhere is, like classes for example but don't want to be that one person with a schedule still, take a picture on your phone and just look at that before the bell rings for every class. I don't think this is a big problem for many people but I thought of it because its what I've been doing for the past 3 weeks, finally memorized my classes yesterday actually. This also works with if you leave a room to go get something in an unknown place like a building or an office, write down on phone how to get back .Especially if you have gotten lost in office buildings before trying to go to the bathroom. (Just me maybe? lol) \n\nTip 2: Lessons in classes typically go way to fast for me, especially in ap classes, I also seen a few people on this subreddit talk about this. The best way I found is to make sure you write down the exact steps for every type of problem, typically the notes just have example problems and vocab definitions but that isn't really helpful when you can't remember any of it or any of the steps. It's better to make steps telling you exactly what you do instead of looking at your example for an hour trying to figure out how you got each one. Write the steps like your trying to take notes for someone else who is absent and doesn't know it at all. Also, youtube and khan academy are the amazing places to go if you didn't understand or couldn't keep up with the lesson, type in what the homework is on and watch videos on it. Videos are much more easier to keep up with because you can pause it to give you time to think, I also have to rewind it sometimes before I understand it. That is also a great way to review for tests.\n\nTip 3: Write down everything you have to do, homework, places to go, everything. I personally like to keep a mini notebook (those really little booklets you get at vera Bradley) and I write all things I need to complete that night as I go from class to class. \n\nTip 4: Find every little memorization trick there is for every math formula or figure out why that formula is what it is. I don't know why this happens but if I look up a video that goes into specifics on how the formula was created (think proofs in geometry), I can remember it way better than if I just try to memorize a formula that came out of thin air. It's more to learn but I find it worth it. Also do the memorization parts of the test first so you don't forget it. This tip really applies towards classes like pre cal or ap math classes, where you have to memorize tons of formulas and the unit circle (I hate that thing so much).\n\nTip 4: Quizlet is helpful for memorizing vocab words, go over the words over and over again until it becomes second nature. Get it out of that short term memory.\n\nAnyways I hope these help someone, it's late and night and I kind of got this idea to write this out of boredom so I hope no one minds.

I was diagnosed with Auditory Processing Disorder. \n\nI'm in University part time, and the school requires a new assessment of my learning disability because more than 5 years has passed. Also, they want to test for a math based learning disability based on my school grades. I was told there appears to be something off because I was in enhanced English classes as a teen (highest difficulty available at the school) but I failed the most basic math courses repeatedly. My advisor said he'd bet dollars to donuts I have dyscalculia.\n\nHow do they test for these issues? I've googled but I'm still unclear how this works. I wonder if the tests will miss the difference between my coping strategies that I've been honing all my life or if they will see past that. I don't mind if I lose extra time in History and English exams. But I would like to take math and science courses. I NEED more time in Math and Science exams and I need tutorial help in Math and Science. I have to take Math and Science courses for breadth requirements to graduate. But I fear retesting will miss my problems. I can understand broader mathematical concepts but constantly muddle up addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. If they test math on paper and give me time, I can do it. But if they ask me for mental math they're more likely to get tears out of me than any correct answers. \n\nShould I be worried? I have that sickening feeling the retesting is just exclude as many people as possible from help. I have a 3.7 gpa and I'm working towards a BA hon. as a History Specialist. I absolutely love History, I enjoy English and the Social Sciences. Sometimes I feel like I'm cheating because I love what I'm doing so much. But I'm terrified of the Math and Science components to get this degree. If this retesting misses my issues, I'm screwed beyond belief. I'm not going to get through this without help significant in Math. I would enjoy Science if there weren't so much Math laced into it.\n\nHas anyone else been rested as an adult after being tested as a kid? What happened? If they take extra time from me in Humanities exams, my GPA will be a little lower or I'll have to work harder. I went over time by about 10-15 minutes. But I've never made it through a math exam in my teens without taking at least an extra hour. I can do Math, but I need a lot of time and help.

What's really frustrating me is that some of the material on the quizzes aren't in the lesson notes. Legitamately, I look through a lesson's 4 times and I didn't anything similar to a problem. Heck, one time a pi equation showed up in the **pre-algebra** section. I'm just getting frustrated at this point and I'm not even half way through it. I have the rest of summer to finish it, but what worries me is trying to memorize all of these convoluted formulas. Because I can take a test afterwards, which could let me skip a math class.

(I\u2019m not just saying that because I\u2019m biased. He has the awards to back it up!) A few months ago, he got a job at one of the best branding agencies in our city. We were all thrilled! Unfortunately, as time went on, he was really struggling to keep up with workloads. He began to describe this as \u2018not comprehending things as fast as coworkers\u2019 and \u2018not remembering details clearly\u2019. Because of his struggle, he was working all hours of the day, exhausting himself, and falling into creative blocks which fed the cycle of not being able to keep up.\n\n\nSix months in to this job and after some very open discussion his boss has decided it might be best to let him go. The workload was quite heavy. Everyone in the office would work after hours (small ad agency life often calls for that). But it was obvious that even while working 18 hour days, he couldn\u2019t deliver the quality of work in the time they were expecting.\n\n\nI came together with his mother and we\u2019ve agreed this may be attributed to the learning disabilities he was plagued with in elementary school and through high school. He comes from a very low-income background. While his mother is wonderful, she doesn\u2019t remember or have any paperwork for specific diagnoses. Finally, I got out of him that he struggled with reading comprehension and classroom-style learning through high school, barely followed through with counselors while getting his associate\u2019s, and did nothing to pursue help while getting his Bachelor\u2019s degree, even after being assigned a counselor.\n\n\n**All of this back story is to explain my question: Now what?**\n\nWhat resources should we be looking for to help him find ways of coping in the workplace? Do I look for adult reading comprehension classes, a career advisor or counselor, or a psychologist? Any advice on where we can find help for him?\n\nI really appreciate any help or directions that you could point me. I want my boyfriend to get back on track and know that this doesn't have to stop him from being successful.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Old learning disability reappearing in adult life.

I'm a person in their late teens (19) who's in thier junior year of college. I'm generally good at math, except when it has been coming to these complicated word problems, because I hardly have any idea what the problems are talking about or referring to, because of my severe dyslexia. Not to mention that reading the textbook is next to impossible, because the words, numbers and symbols occassionally move around, not to mention that even when that doesn't occur, it is difficult to know what the book is saying. Professors have literally thought that applied mathematics is too abstract for me just because of my dyslexia, which makes me furious. Proofs are slightly better, but not by much, because of how wordy theorems are, and memorizing text is difficult for me, so much so that the words always get stuck in my head hwen I have to prove something for a math exam, resulting me in getting low grades percentage wise, (not neceessarily low compared to the average)  but definitely low based on my ability (I'm twice-exceptional and identified as gifted in math). Not to mention I feel horrible about the fact that this one professor gave me extra time, but then later on upon talking with him, said that it wouldn't have made a difference because I still would have failed even after taking the extra time (even though he didn't grade the portion that I took extra time with because I'm trying to get my accomodations filled out formally, so I don't even have a clue as to how he could know this). So, I'm wondering if you all ahve any advice on what I can do. It also doesn't help that my math professor automatically assume how competent I am at math based purely on my test scores, which of course, are filled with multitudes of words.

I took a gap year and I'm starting college for the fall 2018 semester, and I have severe inattentive ADHD causing me to not understand verbal language but I had several misdiagnoses before this so I never had the right accommodations in school before.\n\nMy mom and I are keeping contact with the disability office at the college so I can be prepared before moving in and one of the accommodations that they recommended was a listening device for class where'd I'd listen to things using headphones.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for such a device. I would prefer something that wouldn't look to weird like a headset or something lol. Maybe something with one earbud in one ear and connected to a recording device? idk\n\nThe disability office also told us to come up with other accommodations that I might need, so I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions.. other things I struggle with include reading (severely impaired), speech(severe), writing, and memory.\n\nAny other college+ADHD tips would also be appreciated!\n\nThank you!\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 451, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for an assistive listening device recommendation for class+other accommodation recs", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/8h3ywn/looking_for_an_assistive_listening_device/"}, {"author": "halci", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1525417806, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/8gxdi8/ee_student_with_3d/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8gxdi8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/8gxdi8/ee_student_with_3d/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1525417808, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 4, "selftext": "Hey reddit, i just write down my experiences for the people like me. So I have diszlexia, discalculia and disgraphia it get diagnosed when I was 10 years old (if you have all three disabilities in my country we call 3D). I always struggle in school. When I go to collage first I wanted to studying programing but everybody told me \"this is too hard for you\" I ended up \"studying\" economics and I hated it. I quit because I'm not interested in this type of thing.  2 years later I started studying Electronics and this time I make a language exam in English. BTW in mid and high school I learned German for over 6 years but this wasn't my cup of tea and never learned English in school or with a teacher. So when I graduated as technician and go back to college because i want to be an electrical engineer. Meanwhile I have to starting a job. And this combo is super hard. Like when you play a game and accidentally pick the hardest mode but you can't change it. I bearly can pass half of my classes. In Calc 1 we not able to use a calculator. I struggle with multiply and divide single numbers. But i easily make differential equalitions. Strange thing. I figured it out how to learn in the other way. But with this method it's very time consuming. I just want to say nothing is impossible. Be patient and never give up your dreams. Take care of yourself.\n\nps: sorry for bad English.

I have a 10 year old in 4th grade. She\u2019s a great leader. Wonderfully empathetic. A little shy at times but she doesn\u2019t let it stop her. From the time she started writing, she\u2019s reversed letters. Not just reversed- mirrored. She\u2019d mirror entire words- completely correctly but perfectly mirrored. I noticed this in pre school and it was the first thing I mentioned in kindergarten- public school. Of course when kids are that young they do this for awhile. So it was kinda ignored and corrected when it happened. 2nd grade came around. She was still reversing words and letters. I mention it again. Now she\u2019s not picking things up quickly. Her hand writing is sloppy. She struggling with math. It seems like she doesn\u2019t understand how words sound. I request an IEP. They tell me it\u2019s too early to diagnose something. But they will give her extra time with a reading specialist and reject my request for an IEP. Her grades pop back up a bit. Ok. Third grade comes around. She\u2019s doing ok at the start. She\u2019s still reversing. She\u2019s failing tests. She still cannot write clearly. She loves math but it takes her 3 minutes for one problem and only excessive amounts of practice makes it become rote for her- and that only works for about 50% of the problems. I go to the pediatrician again. They write a letter again requesting she be tested. I take it to the school and request an IEP. I get in front of the teachers and administrators and they openly scoffed at me. They said since she wasn\u2019t failing (they give her the lowest level work possible and say hurrah when she gets it right) she doesn\u2019t need an IEP or testing, that it\u2019s focus and she should see a pediatrician for meds. I left that meeting as mad as I\u2019ve ever been before. She\u2019s drawing crying faces on her tests. She wrote \u201cI want to die\u201d on a notebook and was sent to see the counselor. She\u2019s in 4th grade now and she isn\u2019t bringing much home for me to see. But her report cards are As and Bs. So I\u2019ve let it go for now. She seems happy enough. She struggles with remembering to bring things home but I\u2019m talking to her teacher on email and think that\u2019s enough to keep on top of things. \n\nThen this last week I finally saw a spelling test. Her words were pat, jump, and other three letter words. When I asked what her words were for this week, she didn\u2019t have them. The teacher hadn\u2019t given them to her. I asked my daughter to get the words from a classmate and she told me that no one else gets her words. She said the other kids get words like responsibility. She\u2019s getting pat. I\u2019m obviously concerned and contact the teacher who tells me that she\u2019s been getting these words since the start of the year after a test showed she needed help with phonetics. Ok. Well she consistently gets 100% on these tests and has been, apparently. But they still haven\u2019t moved her up to harder words yet. I\u2019m outraged and upset that there is such a huge gap in between her and the rest of her class. She\u2019s getting words that my second grader got at the start of the year. But even though my daughter is getting 100% on these spelling tests, ask her to write the words in a sentence and they are still wrong. Her writing is horrible. She doesn\u2019t use punctuation. Her capitalization is messed up because she uses that to help overcome her reversing. She writes across a page and not in between the lines unless really prompted. It takes her 45 minutes to write two paragraphs and when I circle the misspelled words, it takes her 2 hours, a dictionary, and me helping her sound things out for the two paragraphs to be corrected suitably. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m screaming at a wall. She obviously has something wrong with her learning but since she\u2019s just barely scraping by, the administrators and teachers do nothing about it. Yes, they provide a reading specialist but it seems to be a bandaid. Year after year for the last 4 years, it\u2019s been the same. Start the year ok. Teacher tells me everything is fine. All of a sudden spring comes around and BAM- my kid isn\u2019t performing on level and there\u2019s a problem. The teacher says my daughter doesn\u2019t pay attention in class, she prefers to read. And she says it\u2019s an issue with focus. I know it\u2019s not an issue with focus because she\u2019s obviously able to focus on reading during class! My daughter just feels defeated. She can\u2019t keep up. After years of being shunted to the side or pulled out of class to sit with a reading specialist or given different work from her classmates- she has huge gaps in her knowledge. 5th grade will have a much larger work load. So will middle school. I think they may want to hold her back or keep her in remedial classes as a solution. But that will impact her negatively in so many ways. If they would just test her for learning disabilities we could help her better but they refuse to set up an IEP! If anyone has experience with this, what did you do to get the help you or your kid needed? How do you make them listen?

He seemed to understand when I told him I have an LD, but he seemed frustrated again,  last lesson, 6/10 lessons in.\n\nHe emailed me instructions, which I read and study. I also watch YouTube videos on how to do these maneuvers, write steps down, and try to picture myself in a car doing everything. I remember how to do things when I\u2019m not behind the wheel,  but forget when I am behind the wheel and get too nervous. This didn\u2019t really happen to me when I took exams in school because I wasn\u2019t behind a wheel, in control of a huge hunk of metal.\n\nI am taking his suggestion from last lesson to study even more and see where I get with that, but I can\u2019t seem to understand why he\u2019s frustrated at the fact that I don\u2019t have it down yet. \n\nI\u2019ve only been driving for a month, not even, being that I don\u2019t practice EVERY single day. I was literally handed my learner\u2019s permit a month ago. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be frustrated at all if I was teaching someone how to drive and if they didn\u2019t have the two maneuvers down by now. Maybe if I have been telling them how to do it for like 6 months and if they still didn\u2019t have it down, there might be an issue. I know people who didn\u2019t pass their road test on their first shot. I know experienced drivers who can\u2019t do these maneuvers perfectly either, so I don\u2019t understand why my driving instructor is doing this to me. \n\nIt especially makes me nervous when he puts me on the spot and asks if I know what to do &amp; that\u2019s where his frustration comes in. \n\nI practice with my parents too at least once a week and even they are okay with the fact that I don\u2019t have these maneuvers down yet, as I would be. They keep telling me it will just take time and practice. I TOTALLY agree with them!!!\n\nAnd I don\u2019t have to take my first road test for another year. Here in New York, you don\u2019t have to take it until it has been a year after you\u2019ve taken your 5 hour class, which for me, is in two weeks, so I think I have PLENTY of time &amp; that my state has that policy for a reason!\n\nI just don\u2019t get why my instructor seems to be pushing and rushing me into learning these maneuvers. His frustration is making me feel like garbage and like not wanting to learn to drive anymore, which isn\u2019t a good thing. He said I\u2019ve improved since lesson one, but then there is this.\n\nMaybe I am just missing something. What can I do? What do you guys think of this, as a community? Help?\n\nFinally, for those of you who have licenses, what did you guys do about these multi-step maneuvers, for an FYI for me?

Chinese was hard to study until I implemented TTS with my Flashcards and from there I was able to retain most words per night. \n\nIf someone else has these same needs, I'd like to know what your background is in terms of ability, and also how do you make the most out of your day to day when it comes to learning?

I'm a 3rd year CS student and I'm currently starting to struggle. I'm someone who has done well CS wise up until recently. Basically, I'm an A/A- student when it comes to programming assignments (lowest score I've gotten on an assignment in 3 years was probably an 80 with an average close to a 92). When it comes to written midterms or quizzes, I average about a C/C-. There is a huge gap.\n\nI go to lecture, it was my favorite part of data structures/ Algorithms and Intro class. Missed class twice whole semester due to interviews. I read the material but it doesn't seem to click like programming does. I understand programming as a concept because it's translation and open to interpretation which I do well at, ironically, even though it's still very technical. But when it comes to midterms etc I do very poorly. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and I believe I have a learning disorder based on a gap between my Verbal IQ (98% percentile) and Performance IQ (55%).I believe this is a NVLD as I experience a lot of the symptoms of NVLD. This isn't meant to brag but to highlight the learning disability. It's more  1 more standard deviation from what's considered statistically significant (15 point gap vs my 32 point gap).\n\nI'm basically failing my computer architecture class. Again the same pattern presents itself. Things on the midterm I don't seem to understand. I read the book consistently. I usually start out ahead in the material but other kids catch up and pass me within 2-3 days of reading the same material. It's become pretty discouraging. I am on ADHD medication but I would like some help with I guess linking what happens under the hood (architecture, operating systems, algorithms, etc) with what I am writing in my programs. I also deal with psychosis and visual/auditory hallucinations (I hear voices and am lucid sometimes in and out). I also take medication for this. Reading for me seems to be basically just looking at the words on the page without really understanding them. I LOVED early lectures because instructors used analogies and described things conceptually but now we have become a lot more technical and specifics based. I struggle very much with this.\n\nI had a feeeling I was lazy and not trying hard enough but I've kind of started to debunk that. I worked about as hard as other students in this class. Going to lecture, reading the book, etc but I'm doing way worse than them. I have started to notice this pattern in other aspects of my life. Things I understand I do very well at. I have a hard time making mental leaps without being babied through it. Even then, thinking critically or applying it in new contexts has always been hard for me. Think a lifetime B student in Math/Science... I get it once it's explained. It's really starting to bother me. Because I know that I'm not lazy now. Something is different about programming. I know how to solve problems and I know how to translate it into code.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I am worried about huge GAP in my abilities and my effort.

So I will.\n\nI'm  22 and I was diagnosed with dyspraxia and ADHD less than a year ago. I think I always knew I had ADHD, and in the time before I was diagnosed I think I learned how to cope with it a lot, and the only way I've progressed in that part is by how what I didn't see in myself before, I now see and work on.\n\nBut dyspraxia caught me by surprise. I had no idea I was dyspraxic. I thought dyspraxia was just not being able to catch a ball, then I got diagnosed, and pretty quickly things started making sense.\n\nDyspraxia is not limited to physical coordination but mental (for me) even more so. I can't  even count the number of days I have two different things planned for dinner and it's  not until I look at the fridge I realise that all day I have been thinking about 1. How that chicken is going to go off so I have to have it for dinner. 2. That I've been craving cous cous salad for ages and have appointed tonight as the night. All day I will take turns thinking about both, with no idea I also have another idea.\n\nPeople don't talk about what it's  like to routinely have concepts you are very comfortable with explained to you repeatedly, because people don't get it and they think you're stupid.\n\nLiving with dyspraxia is so hard, and I'm not unhappy or ungrateful for my life but it's fucking difficult living with a brain like mine. I always just thought I was eccentric, but the very common mixture of hyperactivity and dyspraxia just make me seem even more so than I am. \n\nBut if people got that I understand things better when I see them written down, or that I have to take what you say entirely literally because I can't trust my brain to interperet what you say, maybe they wouldn't be so instinctively dismissive of our capabilities.\n\nIn the consulation I got diagnosed, my diagnoser told me about his son. He told me that his son was doing a masters in bio med and he has what I have, and he said to me that it doesnt make you stupid, it makes you different. I asked him at the end of our meeting \"Will it get better?\" With tears in my eyes and he said, \"No. But you will learn to translate.\" And that hit me on the walk home and keeps hitting me every day.\n\nIt's a silent difference. It means certain things are unfathomably harder to you. I'm studying for a maths degree but certain basic tasks defeat me. I have no doubts in my intelligence but if you ask me to find a list of words in a thousand I would rather go for a cigarette and put it out in my eye.\n\nHolding and maintaining arguements in debates defeats every IQ point I have. It makes me sound thick when halfway through a debate I find myself debating the opposite argument, but it doesnt mean I don't know what I'm talking about, I just got confused between the part of the opposed that I agree with and the part I don't. People take advantage of this.\n\nPeople dont speak enough about how it is wired into every part of your thinking. Now so long after being diagnosed I can put my hands up and say I know what parts of me start and end with dysparaxia and ADHD, and the overlap between them. But what gets me on a day to day basis is that there is no point explaining to people that I think differently. People can take advantage.\n\nIn my experience people don't understand that different brains are different in such a broad way. \n\nAnd this is not something which hinders my intelligence, just the way I think. They dont know.\n\nYou don't know what you don't know.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What you might not have heard", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/7czv3k/what_you_might_not_have_heard/"}, {"author": "gogomojito", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1510566317, "domain": "gogomojito.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/7cm3fc/hi_all_im_just_starting_out_on_a_blog_journey_new/", "id": "7cm3fc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/7cm3fc/hi_all_im_just_starting_out_on_a_blog_journey_new/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "link", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "HTyNBQN5ZKwygvv70mnUGfth_cm41CNH9rc_UWU-6lA", "resolutions": [{"height": 162, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/8euhW5xYnsBHffbaM69PUMkLLnRFX5rRqokV0vTz5r4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=9e2816f9da4c7547e6ab7d523088c5f2", "width": 108}, {"height": 324, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/8euhW5xYnsBHffbaM69PUMkLLnRFX5rRqokV0vTz5r4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=6ba058647fe2aef5a390a7548a80f3cc", "width": 216}, {"height": 480, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/8euhW5xYnsBHffbaM69PUMkLLnRFX5rRqokV0vTz5r4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=234c3f90277323109e6bdf1d917a6837", "width": 320}, {"height": 960, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/8euhW5xYnsBHffbaM69PUMkLLnRFX5rRqokV0vTz5r4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=fd56e950cb44c21e440849641e18d718", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 1200, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/8euhW5xYnsBHffbaM69PUMkLLnRFX5rRqokV0vTz5r4.jpg?s=07c2e4699534273fb118a134fef3b9d0", "width": 800}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1510638697, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tGSoypGhM0BgVIfgAqtCZZHWhLtvPKQVRlT9fZpFQus.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Hi all, I'm just starting out on a blog journey &amp; new here.

Every time I struggled to keep up with the learning after the first couple of weeks while others in the class surpassed me. I would perhaps learn them if I drop everything else in life and only study one thing. Also I don't have a sense of direction. I only can navigate using landmarks and even those I can't remember.

But seems like now it's become the only way for me to do what I'm asked, but without actual understanding of what I did.

So I just try to remember how the example was and attempt to cross-reference them with my tasks, but without understanding anything about it. It's almost like pressing buttons in a certain sequence without understanding what they do. More to that, teachers are going too fast all the time. I can't catch up. I need very detailed and slow instructions with a lot of time to process each function, but they just don't stop to even explain functions, yet everyone seems to be able to follow. Even visually, I often look at something and it could take hours until I understand. I don't seem to process information in the same way as other people.

We have 3 daughters. I'll call them A,  Bea and C. A and C cruise through things, no worries or concerns. They just get mention to reference the facts that we have experience with the usual learning process without difficulties, and Bea is in a situation where she has a close in age younger sister passing her in abilities. \n\nThroughout Bea's growth, she's always struggled with reading. This is despite the fact that we are a very reading friendly family. We still in fact do bedtime stories almost every night except now the kids read them to us. There is a 50 - 50 chance of finding A and C just sitting in their room reading if they aren't downstairs playing. Bea never caught the reading big but loves to be read to. In fact she almost prefers it to television. (Mainly since we dropped cable) \n\nShe never seems to mix up her words, or confuse them. She just doesn't seem to get each word very fast. She stares at a word and thinks for a bit, might do some sounding out, and eventually either gets the word or a similar sounding word. She only has this issue with words. Numbers are her thing. She loves them.\n\nThis year at the start of the school year they did an assessment of Bea. The accessment (as explained to us) compared her directly to children her age across the country. The accessment is a 1-100 type thing, where anywhere from 20 to 70 was normal expected range. It covered reading, writing, and math (broken down into segments with an overall of your lowest score). Bea got 1 in reading. 3 in writing. And an overall of 73 in math with division bringing it down to that. From those scores they've requested and received our permission to look further into why her scores are so disportinate and look at learning disabilities.\n\nI suppose my questions to you are:\n\nAre we catching this at the right age? I know the schools process for catching learning disabilities really starts now and we have made sure she has received help every step of the way but is this something we should have caught earlier?\n\nWhat kinda of learning disabilities affect the ability to understand letters and words written down, but not numbers?\n\nWe are 1000% supportive of Bea the entire way, but her frustration with her sister outpacing her is already beginning to show. I've had some success with refocusing, having Bea help C with math and explaining that different people have different strengths, but how do we help her cope in the midterm while she is diagnosed and there is literally nothing but struggle for Bea at the moment?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Advice Request: Daughter, 9, starting the road to diagnosis", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/722qqa/advice_request_daughter_9_starting_the_road_to/"}, {"author": "SpottedPlatypus", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1506187017, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/71zjsj/online_groups_for_the_learning_disabled/", "id": "71zjsj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/71zjsj/online_groups_for_the_learning_disabled/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1506280193, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hi, I have a 29 year old sister who suffers from a learning disability.

This year I'm changing it up a little and focusing specifically on learning disabilities. I'm looking for feedback regarding: 1)anything that is not clear about it 2) any way to improve it (sorry, I can't offer more than $200) 3) or any other criticisms. Thanks for your time. I just posted it on my blog but will edit it according to feedback.\n\n\"The Seattle Tutoring Services Learning Disability Scholarship (http://www.tutoringservicesseattle.com/learning-disability-scholarship/) was created to recognize the challenges some students face in their academic and professional careers.\nAs tutors, we work with students with identified and unidentified learning disabilities. Many people without learning disabilities do not fully appreciate the challenges they face and the persistence required to be successful. The aim of this scholarship is to offer a reward to those who have pushed forward in the face of these obstacles and encourage others to do the same. \nConstruct an essay that discusses your struggles in education and how you have been able to overcome them. Even if you have not been successful as you would like, we encourage you to apply and discuss even the small victories, ranging from getting a disability accommodation at school to modest improvements with your grades.

I would like to ask some questions/read people's experiences of daily traveling, public transport and (if anyone has experience/knowledge of) independent travel training either for yourself or for a family member with a disability.\n\nThis is not for academic/research purposes - I am progressing from my current role as a Travel Trainer to becoming a Travel Training Co-ordinator and would like to ask the community about their experiences traveling and using public transport so that I can better inform my future practice. I am currently to be based in London, UK. Future work may involve training staff in more rural areas.\n\nIn my work as a travel trainer, I have almost exclusively been assigned to work with young people with autism - partially because I am autistic myself and partially because the field of autism is where I have most of my work/research experience - so I am now conscious of the fact that I will be supervising and overseeing other staff working with young people with disabilities that I have less knowledge of. I am reading widely and making inquiries in other places, and I would really appreciate it if anyone was happy to share their experiences of traveling or (if you have had it) travel training.\n\nSome ideas/questions/prompts of the sorts of experiences I am thinking of are:\n\n* General experiences of traveling and barriers that you have faced in travelling.\n\n* Strategies/equipment/supports/apps etc. that are beneficial for you in travelling.\n\n* Public transport experiences.\n\n* Travelling independently/learning to travel independently. Experiences and barriers you faced, what helped or what did people do that made things worse?\n\n* Working with staff/professionals: What difficulties have you faced with staff/professionals?

dyslexia. The teacher who asked for me to get help asked me if it helped i said no. That was the only time i got support, nothing else happened until i started college they pulled me out of class and the teacher was thinking i have a learning disability i got sent to learning inclusion and if i can recall but they didn't specify what it was, and they told me to fill in some sheets and asked if the support they gave helped but i did not receive support.

My dream requires a PhD so I've applied to programs twice already but my math score is too low to be considered by any program. So I saw a psychologist, got tested, and with her recommendation was approved for extra time on the GRE, so now I have just under an hour to do 20 math problems. I know it's not worth getting upset about it, but if I stew on it I am a little mad that this wasn't caught in school. When I was a kid I had some issues reading so I had some extra help to get me on track and that worked, but never for math. It just \"wasn't my strong-suit\" and the only \"help\" I ever got was being put in a basic math class in high school (but on my transcripts it reads as normal. It wasn't special ed., just a little slower and a bit less material). The psychologist I saw said that's common for kids just have math issues  to have it overlooked over because there's not learning issues across the board.\n\nBut I'm not handling this well. I study for at least 2 hours a day and will soon be starting with a tutor but nothing seems to work. I've used just about every prep book out there, done online mock tests, had previous tutoring... nothing sticks. I'm demoralized at this point. I feel like a fucking idiot. And part of that is because when I google dyscalculia it seems that the stuff that comes up is resources for kids and parents. I also hate talking about it because it does make me feel like less of a person. \n\n I have 99% percentile verbal skills and have gotten perfect and near perfect scores on the writing part of the GRE, but because I can't figure out basic math concepts there's a real chance I can't reach my ultimate goal. And I want to get there- more than anything.  And I know that in a program I would be successful. I work in my desired field so I know what it takes. It just seems like I can't do this test. And what's worse is that it seems like there's no pattern to my mistakes. Like, I'll do 10 prep problems, get 6 wrong and revisit them some time later and get 7 wrong. Or half of the original 6 wrong and 3 new ones. \n\nOn good days I'm only mildly stressed but on bad days I cry on my way to work, maybe at work, maybe on the way home, maybe at home. I just hate myself. And I know my attitude isn't helping. I've just never struggled with anyone so much in my life and it's something that's objectively not hard. It feels like no one understands.   \n\n\nI just needed to get this off my chest.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 891, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I was recently diagnosed with a learning disability as an adult.

I didn't understand what was going on in my classes and the work was hard; but I was too ashamed and stubborn to ask for help. I would fail a majority of my classes until finally my GPA got under a 2.0. I then got put on academic probation and I was given 4 chances to get my GPA up. Which I failed miserably. Last week my grades came in and my academic standing was exclusion. \n\nI feel ashamed and worthless. I could've tried in my classes but I had no motivation. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't pass the classes for my major, Plus I just wasn't that interested. The only reason why I even went to college was to please my parents, who would make my life a living hell if I didn't go. I wanted to take a gap year after high school but my mom said no and forced me to go right away. \n\nMy parents are very mentally abusive. They're Haitian too, and Haitian parents are really strict on their kids; Especially when it comes to school. I'm terrified of telling them because they might kick me out of the house. I'm planning on telling them this Friday because by then I'll have money if they really do kick me out. \n\nI'm not proud of the situation I've gotten myself into and I know that I've ruined my future.

I'm 22 years old and learned English as a second language at about 8 years old because I struggled with learning it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I went to an APD specialist and got tested for three hours, and towards the end of the testing where I had to identify words out of background noise I got extremely overwhelmed and had a sensory overload. The audiologist was wonderful and allowed me to take breaks and was very encouraging. \n\nThe tests from today showed that my hearing was at \"the top 1%,\" which was relieving, but my auditory processing skills were nonexistent. \n\nI am so sure I have a learning disability because I struggled greatly in school, cheated on every test to pass the class (please don't crucify me for that), never understood lectures, and almost graduated late due to those issues. Right now I am taking online college courses which is easier to manage, but whenever I get close to getting anything less than a B- in a class, I withdraw from it for \"personal reasons.\" That is why my GPA in college is at a 3.9, I mentally shut down and I fall behind in class easily when I fall below the B/B- threshold. \n\nThe audiologist just looked at my GPA and said since I am doing \"very well\" in school, I cannot have a learning disability and I have auditory processing difficulties, not APD. She said I just have to figure out what's right for me and move forward, but I have to switch over to a physical classroom next spring for my major-requirement classes, and she didn't approve for any accommodations for me on campus. I am completely lost, broken down, and confused. What do I do next? How do I have \"nonexistent auditory processing skills\" but no formal diagnosis or more information about it? How can I attend a normal class without resorting to cheating, withdrawing, and giving up? I'm at a complete loss and any advice is greatly appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a side note: I did everything I could to study, I had tutors, online help, and in high school stayed after hours with the teachers to get help. It was not out of pure laziness, I honestly can't understand the lecture and my brain focuses on background noise rather than the main focus. After struggling with school since elementary, I gave up and although I want to get the college degree more than anything, I am out of options and need answers.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 822, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I was told I can't have a learning disability?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561761862, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/c6c6u3/i_was_told_i_cant_have_a_learning_disability/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "StateofCare", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3uidel7c", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561548739, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/c5opeh/created_a_new_podcast_to_bring_awareness_just/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c5opeh", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/c5opeh/created_a_new_podcast_to_bring_awareness_just/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561548740, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 819, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Created a new podcast to bring awareness just started has a few episodes we really want is opinions on how we can do it better", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561635113, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/c5opeh/created_a_new_podcast_to_bring_awareness_just/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "b50142", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2a1i7x3h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561295479, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/c44f32/participants_needed_support_workers_healthcare/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c44f32", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/c44f32/participants_needed_support_workers_healthcare/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561295480, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI am a MSc Psychology student currently looking for support workers (or a similar role such as healthcare assistant or carer) to answer my questionnaire about vicarious trauma and personality types. The questionnaire is about 20 minutes long. All data collected will be anonymous and will form as part of my dissertation.\n\nVicarious trauma is the physical, psychological and spiritual changes that can occur from an individual witnessing the pain, fear and terror that trauma survivors have endured. Very little research has been conducted on vicarious trauma and support workers therefore it is important this research is done to get as much recognition as other healthcare professionals.\n\nThe definition of support worker is someone who looks after the well-being of vulnerable people. They help people to live their lives as independently as possible and support them in reaching their potential, through both practical and emotional support. A support worker role will vary depending on the person you\u2019re supporting, but generally speaking you will be supporting vulnerable people with many aspects of their day-to-day living, helping them to take care of themselves and live a fulfilled life. Different people will need support for different reasons. For instance, they may have mental health needs, learning disabilities, medical conditions or physical disabilities.\n\nThis is a re-post so you may have already taken this questionnaire. I am hoping for 20 more responses before I analyse my results next week.\n\nThanks for any responses.\n\nLink to the questionnaire: [https://shusls.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_6nYkLfzLCMysxcp](https://shusls.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6nYkLfzLCMysxcp)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 817, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Participants needed: Support workers, healthcare assistants, caregivers", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561450589, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/c44f32/participants_needed_support_workers_healthcare/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Everyday-Heroes-kids", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3w63iupg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561221209, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/c3rqv0/everyday_heroes_kids_summer_2019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c3rqv0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/c3rqv0/everyday_heroes_kids_summer_2019/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561221210, "score": 3, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 816, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Everyday Heroes Kids - \ud83d\ude80 Summer 2019 www.ehkidshealth.com", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561307590, "url": "https://i.redd.it/81mal1zoqx531.jpg"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "bluesolur", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11d5v3k", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1560793455, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/c1qlwj/always_had_a_learning_disability_went_to_vr_and/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c1qlwj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/c1qlwj/always_had_a_learning_disability_went_to_vr_and/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1560793456, "score": 6, "selftext": "So I grew up knowing I have learning disabilities.

Or something because of her teacher so the vice principal says she\u2019s not allowed in that one because of her attendance (she doesn\u2019t have days off of school only goes to the tutoring because that\u2019s the only help she\u2019s getting) and pulls her out and says even though she got a request from the doctor She\u2019s not going to do the tests to help my sister because they don\u2019t have to. \n\nADVICE WANTED PLEASE HELP", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 796, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "2 years and still nothing!?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559725489, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/bwmkcv/2_years_and_still_nothing/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "PickinWhoopsieDasies", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_348gqp7g", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1559602120, "crosspost_parent": "t3_bwd1jc", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "PickinWhoopsieDasies", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_348gqp7g", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1559610056.0, "created_utc": 1559581256.0, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.dysgraphia", "downs": 0, "edited": 1559602069.0, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "id": "bwd1jc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": null, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": null, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_bwd1jc", "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 1, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "permalink": "/r/dysgraphia/comments/bwd1jc/any_teachers_who_have_dysgraphia/", "pinned": false, "pwls": null, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 4, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I\u2019m in school right now studying to be a teacher.

This makes me lose points. Im always ranked the bottom of the class regarding the grade I get (especially science and maths).

It has been my goal for a while now to pursue graduate school and get a master\u2019s degree. I put it off for a while now because I was very scared of the role my learning disabilities (I have ADHD, dyslexia, and test anxiety) will play in this endeavor, particularly in regards to the GRE. This past year (2018-2019), I decided not to let my fears hold be back any longer, and took the GRE.\n\tMy GRE scores, admittedly, were very poor, which I anticipated. I guess my reading and writing were ok, but my quant score was abysmal.  For a bit, I decided not to apply. Fortunately, upon further research into the programs, many of them did not have specific score requirements for the GRE (though required a score be submitted, kind of as a \u201cformality\u201d) and stated that applications would be reviewed holistically. Many even offered a second essay to explain any educational and/or socio-economic disadvantages in obtaining the knowledge, skills and abilities to develop and participate in a research career and to use this optional essay to explain any disadvantages you experienced and how you overcame such obstacles, and that the admission committee would take these factors into account. I decided this was my way of explaining how ADHD and dyslexia has affected my personal and educational life. I explained how it negatively effective me, especially early in life, but more importantly, how I overcame it. I explained the techniques and accommodations that I developed to adapt and have a successful education though gradeschool and college and further on into my professional career. I felt I made a convincing argument that my school work and 8 years of successful, and relevant, professional career are better measure of my ability to succeed at these programs than the GRE, especially since I was not allowed to use the skills I acquired during the exam. \nLong story short, I did not get into graduate school. I was devastated, but after a period of time I decided to pick myself up and start preparing for the next round of applications.\nI reached out to the programs that I applied to and asked what I can do to be a more competitive applicant. Though the responses varied based on the programs, they all agreed that I needed to improve my GRE score. One even replied \u201cI did see your second essay, and so I know the suggestion to improve your quant GRE score is not without challenge. However, I worry that a score at that % leaves your application largely unreviewed at many institutions. Therefore, it may behoove you to try to raise it some.\u201d \nThis response infuriated me, and largely made me feel misunderstood and honestly\u2026. unintelligent. Once again, I fell into a slump. Feelings of depressing and hopelessness started to set in. After a period of time though, my determination to show them wrong pulled me out and I developed a plan to improve my application, first starting with the GRE\u2026.\nI decided to contact one of the many Prep agencies and asked them what I can do. Based on my learning disabilities, they suggested their private tutor route. These tutors have experience tutoring clients with LD and are able to teach strategies that will take into account testing accommodations. Its sounds perfect, but it costs quite a bit of money\u2026 Hesitantly, I decided it would be worth the investment, but only if I can get the accommodations for the GRE. \nI contacted the ETS to try and figure out how to request testing accommodations. What I found out is that my previous diagnosis is out of date (I got it when I was in grade school), and I need documentation within the past 5 years. It is at this point that I think I\u2019m finally beginning to snap. I\u2019ve called up a host of phycologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologist, and god knows what else and I\u2019m just at a loss. Most have no idea what I\u2019m talking about (some not even knowing what the GRE is, which I find shocking), and the few that know what I\u2019m talking about have stated they are unable to help me and refer me to local testing centers. I\u2019ve contacted these centers and it just leads to more trouble. What I found out is something along the lines of needing to be \u201cre-evaluated\u201d and not re-tested, and the cost for said test is just way more than I can realistically afford on top of tutoring. I moved back with my family a year ago to save money for tuition as well as have some money for unexpected expenses (such as health). It would cost me my entire savings to just get tested and then tutoring. I figured there must be some way to help with the cost of the testing, but it was insisted by multiple professionals that this type of testing is not covered by my health insurance (I was told that LD are not considered a health issue, and would not be covered by my Health insurance). I called my health insurance, and the rep I was talking to seems to be at a loss as to why these preferred providers think that it\u2019s not covered and could not find any reason why it would not be billed under a host of \u201cbill codes\u201d. She said she would investigate on my behalf and get back to me in a few days.  I even called back to the ETS and told them all this information and how confused everyone is. It was suggested that I contact my local Vocational rehabilitation office (a reference they do list on their website) and they should be able to help. I called them\u2026. They have no clue what I was talking about, never heard of the GRE, but will investigate and see what they can do to help and get back to me. They seemed very genuine in wanting to help me achieve a higher education. \nI am at my wits end. I\u2019m incredibly frustrated; I\u2019m trying my hardest to better myself and get further education so that I can get a decent job. I came up with a plan, and it\u2019s falling apart because no matter what action I take, it leads to a dead end. I starting to lose hope. I feel like the graduate schools either didn\u2019t care about my LD or didn\u2019t understand, maybe even holding it against me. I feel like there is a lack of understanding between all parties involved (graduate schools, health professionals, the GRE/ETS, and even me!)  on how an adult (I\u2019m 30) handles LD. So once again, I\u2019m here to vent, but more importantly, to seek counseling on how to approach this problem of the GRE and getting accommodations for my LD. The next round of applications starts in October, and I\u2019m starting to feel pressure due to time. \n\nThank you,", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 792, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Seeking help.

We are interested primarily in the representation of the voices/themes in the poetry, rather than the identity of the writer.  At this time of year we're offering two contests: \n\n[The Tom Howard/John H. Reid Fiction and Essay Contest](https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/tom-howard-john-h-reid-fiction-essay-contest), with two first prizes of $2000 each, ten honorable mentions receiving $100 each, and the top twelve entries published online. The contest is international. The deadline is April 30. It's $20 to enter, which goes towards paying the judges.\n\n[The Wergle Flomp Humor Poetry Contest](https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/wergle-flomp-humor-poetry-contest-free), with a first prize of $1000, a second prize of $250, and ten honorable mentions of $100 each. The top twelve entries will be published online. The contest is international and the deadline is April 1. This contest is free to enter.\n\nSince I started doing outreach on Reddit last year we've received hundreds more entries featuring diverse characters and voices. We're working hard to increase the diversity of our entry pool and give good writers the exposure they deserve. I know /r/LearningDisabilities isn't technically a \"writers' subreddit,\" but in the past some of our strongest entries have come from subs like this one, which ostensibly have nothing to do with writing. So, if you are a writer, please consider entering our contests. And if you know any writers, please consider passing this information on to them.

They seemed like little things before. But over the last few months I've noticed how much they actually affect me.\n\nWhen I was younger, I didn't have friends at school. I got bullied a lot. But, to be fair, I smelled at school, I was a kid who liked to avoid showering (I don't avoid washing anymore!). So this definitely made my time at school harder. It's not that I didn't want friends, I think my social skills lacked because I didn't have anyone to develop them with.\n\nWhen I was at school I couldn't tie my shoe laces (loop and swoop) so I stuck to bunny ears. I'm still doing bunny ears now. I can't seem to learn loop and swoop because I can't take anything in when the cross over happens.\n\nI teach outdoor sports for my job (canoeing, mountain biking etc) but my progress has been hampered because, no matter how hard I try, I can't learn knots. And that is a big part of advancing through qualifications.\n\nAbout five months ago, I took up rugby. I've got a lot of energy and I do like to put it to use productively. I have the fitness for rugby and I have the right build. But, I'm struggling. I can't seem to learn basics. There's a thing called a ruck, in theory it's quite simple and I do understand it. At a slow speed with repetition I can do it. However, at speed in a game I can't do it, there's too much movement for me to take in what stage the ruck is at. In my position, I should be at every ruck. But I can't, because it's almost as though my brain isn't processing things quickly enough.\n\nI've never been good at maths, I still don't know my times tables. I like reading and learning about different subjects. I have a girlfriend. I have friends. I like going out. I am a bit introverted but I can be quite loud and outgoing, but it's usually only around people I'm comfortable with.\n\nDriving etc is fine, for some reason.\n\nI'm sorry this was so long. I don't want to go to the doctors for something that's time wasting.\n\nAnd if this doesn't make sense or sounds ridiculous, again I apologise in advance.

I'm a 25  year old adult turning 26 years old in few days. I have problems such as not being able to distinguish where to put an \"s\" after a word, not being able to use correct prepositions in sentences, lacking very basic general knowledge, lacking memory, not being able to understand sentences well when reading out loud, etc.\n\n**Here I will list out few of the example problems that I can think of for now:**\n\n1. Not being able to distinguish where to put an \"S\" after a word\n\n*  I would use \"head phone\" or \"head phones\" or \"ear phone\" or \"ear phones\" interchangeably.\n*  I would say \"fishes\" when there are  a lot of fish instead of \"fish\"\n*  I would sometimes say \"feets\" instead of \"feet\"\n* Any \"question\" or \"questions\"?\n\n2.   Not being able to use correct prepositions\n\n* I would say \"holes on a tree\" instead of \"holes in a tree\"\n* Can't distinguish difference between \"turn onto something street\" or \"turn into something street\"\n* \"Drive on left or right lane\" or \"Drive in left or right lane\" \n* \"get in the plane\" vs \"get on the plane\"\n\n3.   Lacking very basic general knowledge\n\n* If I was asked what did George Washington do, I would just be like he did something with the 13 colonies, and I wouldn't be able to elaborate further on it......\n* I didn't know tourist attractions like the Grand Canyon or Niagara Falls were owned by the government. I thought they were owned by some rich people.\n* I wasn't able to distinguish between the word mammal and animal  a few days ago and had to google \"mammal\"...\n* Right now I can't distinguish difference between \"reptiles\" and \"amphibians\" and I will have to google them to see the differences.\n\n4.   Lacking memory or attention\n\n* Even though I played blackjack or Texas Hold 'Em Poker numerous times in the past, if I stop playing those card games for few months, The rules become very blurry in my mind and I will  have to google the rules again.\n* In middle or high school, I always had to go up to my teacher after he or she had read the instructions for something to assure I have everything right.\n* I have hard time understanding some movies or shows without English subtitles.\n* If I talk I sometimes get lost in my words and stutter and make up weird words to fit the sentence because I can't think of a word at the moment. \n\nThere are soooooo many more problems to list. These are just a very few I can think of as of now. Is this like a mild learning problem? Does anyone else experience these kinds of problems in their daily life? Am I really lacking mentally compared to normal people?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 657, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I think I have some sort of learning disability or memory loss", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/amyv1x/i_think_i_have_some_sort_of_learning_disability/"}, {"author": "akikio12", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5vh2a5e", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1548889221, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/alipet/studying/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "alipet", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/alipet/studying/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1548889223, "score": 1, "selftext": "I suck at studying and learning stuff please help, I noticed this making things harder for me ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 652, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Studying", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/alipet/studying/"}, {"author": "ponygals", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2itgxmlq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1548563382, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/ak8vf4/repeating_self_in_person_and_in_word/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ak8vf4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/ak8vf4/repeating_self_in_person_and_in_word/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1548563384, "score": 1, "selftext": "Not sure what my friend has, but I noticed whenever her and I hang out in person, she repeats herself, asking the same thing again and again.

My boss is really good with numbers and statistics and I feel like he thinks I'm a complete idiot because I have to have him repeat himself constantly. I also started thinking back to when I was in school as a child. Those story problems in math class were always a nightmare for me. I felt like everyone else understood them and I just sat there in a daze, unsure of what to do. Taking math classes in college also brought this back up. I see the professor write them out and solve them and I felt as though I was reading them in a different language. I've sought out a therapist who had experience with adult learning disabilities, but she doesn't seem to think anything of it. I've also tried to explain this to other people, those I believe to be more intelligent than me, but I don't think they are grasping what I'm trying to convey. Does this sound familiar to anyone?

You wouldn't learn much of anything, you'd never complete more than like a page and a half out of a history textbook, and on Fridays we spent the entire day watching movies.\u00a0 When I stay in my bedroom and I look out at the window and it's past afternoon and it's sunny and beautiful outside, I feel terrible and think shit I gotta do something, it's such a beautiful and perfect day and I'm wasting it, I won't have this gold opportunity forever. Then because I'm feeling guilty I try to go out and do something, but then I'm all alone, start to feel like shit, low self-esteem, nothing really happens or change, and then I think, \"oh well, now I just wanna go home\", and so I go back home, repeat over and over, day after day, and each day hoping that I'll figure out how to break this cycle.Hello I graduate high school a year ago and I was in special education all I can say is a teacher that I had was very very rude and very racist to they have no respect for any white students disabled students and I live in a small neighborhood and they didn't give me support or any advice to help me to continue my education my special ed teacher was an asshole I'm sorry to say this but he was the biggest fuckface ever ever since I graduate in my life has been shit I'm 22 years old and, staying home with my dad and mom and I was in special education for a long time since I was a kid and 6 years being in high school the teachers are very rude and they have no respect at all the very nasty to non-white students I was treated like a fucking animal when I was in special education all we ever did and I'm going to be honest with you all we ever did was second grade reading level and they refused to help me to catch up my grades by the time I graduate high school I was still doing second grade reading books the school that the only care about the athlete I gets so mad when I start to talk about.

I could function fine and do my work but they put me in those stupid fucking babysitter classes because they wanted their school to seem like they were inclusive.\nThose fucking classes ruined everything. Instead of taking some classes that I wanted I got to sit next to the other autistic kids and fucking do elementary shit even in fucking high school. I wasn't a fucking retard but they treated me like one anyways and had one of those goddamn minimum wage piece of shit helper teachers follow me around everywhere.I was bullied and made fun of the ENTIRE TIME I WAS AT SCHOOL. Everybody ignored me or joked about me or straight-up just insulted me every fucking day I always eat lunch by myself and my special ed teachers was always telling me to socialize that's the problem I do socialize but I'm with made fun of I was bullied one time I got beat up and punch in the face at the school bus stop they called in my special ed teacher and I know he was being paid to shut upI've been out of school for a year now and my life is still fucked up because of all that.there Treat you like an animal and plus there dont care about you They put me in special-education because of my speech problem as well and I have a low GPA I know how you feel the teachers they don\u2019t care about us and your correct i\u2019m not saying all special ed teachers a bad there are good teachers who actually care about disable students I know how you feel it\u2019s very sad I feel so mad and angry when people don\u2019t understand me I also got rejected in college because I have a low GPA I also was bullied in high school too and I know how you feel I wonder what you been up to now I hope everything is good with you I understand your pain seriously thank God I\u2019m not the only one who is also complaining about the special ed \nMoney also appears in ways that are not so measurable. Look around the table at any IEP meeting. How many people at the table are being paid to be there Special Ed was crap for me. They never taught us anything and it was nothing more than a glorified babysitting service. Also, you can forget about dating/having a social life once people find out you're in there.\u00a0\nThe teachers weren't worth that much and even they picked on the students from time to time. It was wasteful to be there, considering no matter how bad you were at your work, (you could even miss half of the damn school year) you'll still get passed on to the next grade.\nLI have many issues about my school, especially since they claim to be the best school out there (which is defidentally NOT\nEverybody knows each other in my neighborhood and I'm sorry that I'm keep on posting to you but it seems like my life is not getting anywhere better seems like my life is becoming a nightmare feels like God is punishing me for something I didn't do why do I have to be disabled why I'm getting mad like fucking crazy and no I'm not spamming I'm not making this shit up I just want everyone know what special education did to me I didn't had a good time in special ed all I had was racist teachers complaining about me telling lies about me and the principal they didn't do nothing about it I got bullied multiple-time by teachers telling me going back to second grade you don't belong in my class teacher just locked me out  every time I'm late my social workers not doing anything for me it's fucking very sad I barely have enough money you know I'm trying to live a normal life here I didn't learn a goddamn thing in high school and just Friday I failed the test of the driving test and they charge so much money at the DMV if you want someone to read you a fucking book scuse me for my language I'm not spamming heal and forgive me for my coasting Ord I've been screwed over by special ed system for God's sake I've been taking medication that I was a kid the IP system they gave me and that they gave me when I was a kid I'm not doing anything in my life right now all I'm doing just staying home and I have careless parents that they just want my SSI money my SSI Mondays I'm only getting $849 and maybe that's why they want me to stay home because hey I'm getting free money from the US government  I tried to reach out to my special ed teachers tell them my situation they have blocked me on social media they have blocked me on their emails I just saw one of them at the mall 2 hours ago one of the female mrs. Kelly who is now 50 years old she saw me and I told her my situation she just ignoring me she know who I was because everyone in my town know who I was and before you say no one knows you that was 10 years ago keep in mind I was at the gym one day and I saw my second grade coach I didn't see my second grade coach after 15 years back in 2003 after 2 minutes he recognized me and gave me a hug and handshake and asking me how am I doing and he was crying because I was his favorite student and I had a disability it shows you how there is good people out there but the teachers I had in high school assholes  I'm going to the doctors every day I'm becoming very weak lately and you know it's fucking sad and get into arguments with my parents it's fucking sad when you see your parents saying to your brothers and your sisters saying we are so proud of you because you graduate and to University College and my mom she was crying 3 years ago because my brother bachelor degree I was fucking crying because that was supposed to be me up there I cried because what the system did to me lock me up in special ed terrorized me kept me hostage didn't teach me Jack schitt all I do my health just play video games now it's getting ready and I cannot go anywhere the bus charge almost $3 and I don't have $3 every day to go on the bus my parents they don't come back home around 9 and they cannot take me out and I understand because it's getting late thank you for reading my post and God bless you and once again I'm not attacking any special ed teachers out there", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 574, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Fuck learning disabilities", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/9y7tvn/fuck_learning_disabilities/"}, {"author": "PnssyDestroyer", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_v42pc0r", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542146850, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/9wtos9/possible_learning_disability/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9wtos9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/9wtos9/possible_learning_disability/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1542146851, "score": 1, "selftext": "This might be a long post about my experiences, but I've NEVER thought I'd have a learning disability...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil multiple people, esp. my professor, started to point out the question. \n\nAll similar accusations: need to be repeated the same instruction,  keep making the same mistakes despite being taught repetitively, somehow \"forgetting\" crucial information, skipping parts of /misspelling words or equations, getting \"lost in thought\" about certain concepts, \"spacing out\" a lot, needing to visualize/explain verbally in order to fully understand, but then forgetting what I just learned, understanding only segments my brain chooses to understand and difficulty keeping in those it doesn't (regardless if it's an easy concept)...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never really had much trouble in school. I am a good student, but as the concepts got more abstract (Calc 2+) so did my difficulty in learning. I like to think of myself as a slow learner. I can EASILY get CERTAIN concepts down, but there are CERTAIN other concepts my brain doesn't care to keep in there regardless if it's important or something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I honestly feel like a computer with some faulty hard drive**. My brain doesn't take in everything it reads and only takes/processes portions it cares about. Sometimes even if you repeat to me the concept 5 times, I might get it for like 5 minutes after a session of talking back/forth, then if you make me apply it, it's like I was never taught anything and make the same mistakes. Really annoying... It's only after maybe an hour or two of forcing me to \"play\" with the idea in different situations, that I actually understand and feel what the concept is and its limitations. Like I can *physically* interact with it in my head, as a \"thing\" in memory space, and compare/contrast it with other concept-objects I have in there. \n\nMy brain needs to visualize concepts and \"play\" with it in a mental playground of possibilities in order to appreciate it's use and keep it stored in memory. If it doesn't appreciate it, it becomes like a sinkhole in a timeline of what I just learned. This is terrible for more abstract subjects like chemistry and calculus, because they RELY on previously built in concepts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt just makes me feel really guilty when people have to point out why I have difficulty understanding concepts that seem so \"easy\". They get all surprised about how I know how to do \\[insert complex thing\\], but can't do \\[similarly related complex thing\\]. Ugh\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know, just a rant about what I'm going through.

For, instance if one was to ask me to grab something out of the fridge, or something on a desk, it will take me up to a minute to find it. I have to scan every object individually. This leaks into other things. I remember doing a puzzle (adult one) with a friend, and I was massively overwhelmed as I couldn't take in all the visual pieces at once. I mean I like literally had a headache and had to lay down for 5 minutes (I trooped through though.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's more tough.

I had problems with doing most math related things until about 6th grade, when we where given calculators. Up till then I had been far behind with math (specifically math, but I did well in most other areas). It was believed this was all caused by my teacher letting me off the hook in 2nd grade which caused me to drop behind from then to 5th grade when I got a tutor for the summer and played times attack (which I never got far in and usually had to take my time doing the multiplication). About 6th grade my grades where great, but we had been given calculators, and often my best class where math related courses.\n\nToday, I still have problems with doing multiplication and division without using a calculator. Often I find myself at work or in class unable to do math problems at the speed of others or able to juggle multiple problems like other people. Also, I find I cannot factor when simplifying an expression (like (x+3)(x+1) = whatever), but I can do most other algebra and manipulate equations perfectly fine.\n\nAlso, I have a problem automatically distinguishing right and left. I can't do it automatically and often mix it up (whenever I referee a fencing match I find myself getting corrected unless I take time to think about which side is getting the touch/point). I also have to think about east and west (I remember the settlers travel west and that's this (&lt;--) way on a map). I didn't know what coast I was on until I was about 15, nor could I read an analog clock till then.\n\nNaturally, I've done some of my own reading and found that there are people with dyscalculic tendencies that are actually good with algebra but are, \"...very weak with remembering number bonds and carrying out number calculations\" (http://www.brainhe.com/staff/types/dyscalculiatext.html) like I appear to be.\n\nIs this cluelessness or is this actually Dyscalculia/something similar?\n\nEDIT: I found this (http://www.ldonline.org/xarbb/printtopic/15044?theme=print) and it describes it far better than I do, but I am good with algebra (manipulating the variables in a calculation) when given a piece of paper.

But however, having a low working memory means that sometimes you struggle to learn new information. This is a great barrier for most of us because in order to come up with creative solutions and ideas, first we have to learn the basic information of the particular field first. (discussed in my earlier [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3w7f6f/advantages_of_having_a_poor_working_memory/)  )\n\nBelow I will explain the learning techniques I use. I must say that I am still a having difficult time in certain areas but I know that my learning ability is improving. I have experimented with different techniques over the past years. I discarded ineffective ones made minor and major twerks and somehow came up with a arsenal of techniques that might be useful for people with low working memory. However, I must again emphasized that I am not an expert in learning. I have so far to go in life.  I am still at times riddled with doubts. I just wanted to share this. If you think they are useful feel free to use them. Ok, lets go to the techniques now. \n\n\n**Step One- Planning**\nThis part was mainly influenced by reading [this book](http://www.amazon.com/How-Become-Straight-A-Student-Unconventional/dp/0767922719)  by Carl Newport.  I am also using digital calenders, digital planners etc for all my tasks. If you are not comfortable with this feel free to use a actual physical diary. Initially I too preferred hand written diaries, but after some use  I found digital ones much more convenient . \n\nFirst you need a list named \"weekly list.\"  For this I use [Gtask app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dayup.gtask&amp;hl=en) which integrates with my Google Tasks. This is my main list of things to do. What ever I want to get done. I put it there. For example if the professor announces that there is an exam on the 20th I jot that down here. Or if I have to do the tutorial for web and database I put it there. It will look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/pStXTcx.png). It helps if you put due dates and deadlines if applicable.  (note that this is just a example I made) Basically all your obligations that should be completed gets jotted down here. \n\nNow, we come to our second list called the \"daily list.\" All the things that should be completed in a particular day goes there. You should write it the night before. Studies show that even the act of writing your to do list the night before gets your subconscious mind active.  I use [Business Calendar 2](http://www.businesscalendar.de/) app. So, I jot down the to  do list for the next day there. It looks like this &gt;[1](http://i.imgur.com/hCZRmWU.png) , [2](http://i.imgur.com/4cuPeCq.png). After making the to do list for the next day you go to sleep.\n\nNext day I wake up and play 15 minutes of a FPS mobile game. This is to get me out of the groggy, sleepy state in the morning. But this is not relevant here , so will not talk about it in detail.  After doing this I take out my phone and start making the calendar for the day. Basically, I look at the to do list created the night before and put these tasks throughout the day. It looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ggpAuAR.png).  This is the only planning I need. Then I resume the day.\n\nI use Business Calendar 2 to both make the daily to do list and to make daily schedule. You can use any other similar app, even free google calendar for this.  But, I have found that Business Calendar is the most efficient out of them all.  \n*You can see both your daily calendar and tasks list in one screen\n*You can simply drag events to different time slots if your plans change abruptly. \n*You can shift the entire calendar by specified hours if plans change.\n*You can create sub tasks under main tasks as seen here\n\nI have not seen another calendar app that does all this. If you know any please do share.\n\n\n\n**Step two - Learning new material - Writing the notes**\n\nI am studying in university so I will explain this in that context.\nOne of the main problems faced my people with low working memory is that they find it difficult to follow a lecture. They'll forget the concepts discussed earlier in the lecture. So will not understand the latter ones. \n\nMy solution for this is to watch lecture videos instead of going to live lectures. Lectures are recorded in my university. If this is not the case for you, you will have to attend the lectures and video/audio record the lectures. I heard that if you record audio in Onenote while making notes, the notes will serve as a bookmark for the audio. So, if you click the text, you can hear the audio that is said in the time the text was written. I don't know about this feature that much because I don't use it. But, research this if it is something you would find interesting.\n\nI use OneNote for my note taking. Keep a separate notebook for each subject. Then I create 2 sections. \n*Questions - If I have any doubts or questions in the material I put it there\n*Notes - Contain the main notes. It looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/qYrFROW.png)\n\nThen I create a different page for each week.  \n\nA lecture consists of many key ideas and concepts being explained. After the lecturer finishes explaining one idea or concept, pause the video. Now write this idea in One note in question and answer format. It will look like this. If images and diagrams are present use a snipping tool like pick pick to cut and paste them.  Then resume the video/audio until the lecturer explains the next concept/idea. Repeat this.  At the end of the lecture you have a bundle of questions and answers.  Like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/Te39d42.png) ( I use the tick marks to keep track of whether I put the info to anki or not. &gt;Keep reading.)\n\nIf you hand write your notes (for example maths), scan the notes and convert to pdf file. Then add them to your one note notebook. It is worth it to buy a scanner. Or you can use your school scanner.  You may argue that all this is such a waste of time. But because of our condition we lose track of where notes are and where you can find a particular topic in a bundle of notes. By converting everything to digital, you can easily search for anything. You can even see all the questions as an index. [here] (http://i.imgur.com/ZRIjIEG.png)\n\n\n**Step 3 - Spaced repetition**\n\nFor this you need a spaced repetition software. I like [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), but some like alternatives like superMemo. Briefly, it's a software which shows you flashcards. And according to how well you remembered you give a rating. According to this the software determines the time it should show the question next.  If the question is easier it will show in a longer while, if it is hard it will show in a shorter while. \n\nYou already have your questions in question and answer format. Now easily copy and paste these into anki as flash cards.\n\nI use different decks (folders) for different subjects. Then I create sub folders within this for each week. Eg- it looks like this. To do this just create a new folder, name it 1. \"Week 1\" and drag and drop onto main folder. It becomes  a sub folder. This is so that I can study the material thought this week only in order to answer weekly tutorials, assignments etc.  \n\nIt will look l like [this](http://i.imgur.com/HLbw9fa.png) - note the folder named deliberate practice\n\nIf you want to study for a weekly test only study the relavant subfolders. In the evening before you go to bed, you should study the cards remaining in the entire folder. Studying just before going to bed is apparently good for memory consolidation.\n\nNote that here you don't decide which questions to study. The software gives you a list of questions you should study each day. You do this and you are done for the day. You can do manual studying if you wan't to study a particular chapter/week notes.\n\n\n**Step 4 - Pomodoro**\n\nThis techniques states that you should not study for more than 25 minutes without a break. I use an app called [Clear Forcus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=personal.andreabasso.clearfocus&amp;hl=en) for this.  \nSo, I press play and then start studying. At this time all distractions kept minimum. You are at serious studying. After 25 minutes are over you are given a 5 minute break. You can do what ever you want in this time. I start spotify and start dancing like crazy.  :) After 4 study sessions you get a long break of 20 minutes. \n\n\n**Step 5 - Deliberate Practice**\n\nIf you want the technical definition of this read the Wikipedia page. Practical definition for me is as follows.\nIntentionally practice on harder questions rather than just practicing a series of easier questions. \nAfter you do a set of questions, you realize that many of the questions require same mode of thinking and same problem solving methods. After completing the question set, pick one question that represent each problem solving method. Now put these questions to a sub-folder called deliberate practice. Shown here. No two questions in this sub folder should have the same problem solving method.  Seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/HLbw9fa.png)\n\nGo for all office hours. Have a list of all the questions you didn't understand. Get them clarified. If it doesn't work hire a tutor. Do what ever it takes, avoid only working on the easier questions and avoiding the hard ones. This is where true learning takes place.\n\nYou can practice the deliberate practice sub-folder when you need to revise. This saves time as you don't repeatedly practice similar questions. \n\n*Tasks, calender's, notebooks, anki screenshots are not real. I made them to explain how the system work. \n\nThat's pretty much all the techniques I use. I will leave all relevant links below. I wish you all the best in your learning. If you find these techniques useful do share your experiences.\n\n\n\n[Learning how to learn - Cousera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)\n\n[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/)\n\n[Business Calendar](http://www.businesscalendar.de/)\n\n[GTasks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dayup.gtask&amp;hl=en)  Has iphone app also. google it. \n\n[Clear Focus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=personal.andreabasso.clearfocus&amp;hl=en)  Has iphone app also.

You can solve math problems without difficulty because you  retain all the data required in your mind.\n\nHowever, most people with ADHD and other learning disabilities have below average working memories. I am one of them.  Now I am in university. Learning had been very difficult all my life. I have to practice something more number of times in order to get it. I would get lost in the middle of school lectures because I forgot the beginning of it. Sports coaches and teachers would get frustrated with me because they would think I don't pay enough attention to what they teach. How else would this seemingly normal child fail to retain the information they teach or fail to repeat  a sports move. My life was filled with low self esteem, feeling of inadequacies and imposer syndrome. Only recently had I started to embrace my working memory weakness and see the benefits it caused me.\n\nBut turns out there is a silver lining. Studies show that people with low working memory capacity are much more creative than their high working memory counter-parts.  Reason for this is not very clear but in this [video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/9miFQ/no-need-for-genius-envy) [Babara Oakley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Oakley) argues that this is because people with stronger working memory grasps to existing information and problem solving methods so tightly that there is no room for new ideas to enter.  In contrast people with poor working memory, it is much easier for new ideas to come.  (read [Einstellung effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect) - something related)\n\nSo, as in my case people with lower working memory will struggle to learn new information (eg-programming, accounting, chemistry etc) But after learning the basic data chunks, it's much easier to manipulate them to create novel ideas and problem solving methods.\n\nI am doing computer science in university and I have to admit that still my life is hard. Everyday I doubt myself asking if I am smart enough for CS. Still experience moments of low self esteem, depression etc. But you now what? I am improving. I use a arsenal of study techniques, some fished from various places of the internet others modified by me. Most of them revolving around Anki and One Note.  And each day I feel I am getting good at learning. \n\nI am starting to feel that maybe being born with low working memory is all for the better. Without it I won't have this ability to generate insane, new ideas about things and how to solve questions and how to overcome problems.  Without it I won't learn and develop a set of highly effective learning techniques. I won't develop a strict discipline to make a daily schedule and follow it. \n\nIf you are interested in learning techniques I used . The do ask me. Reddit community had helped me a lot during my times of emotional struggle. It feels great to give something back.\n\n[science daily article about low working memory and creativity](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120807132209.htm)\n[Scientific American article about working memory, ADHD and creativity](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-creative-gifts-of-adhd/)\n\nIf you are interested in more effective ways of learning take the course [learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/welcome)\n\n*I posted this first in ADHD forum and later here after remembering that even people with dyslexia and other learning disabilities suffer from working memory problems.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR - Studies show that people with poor working memory are far more creative than their high working memory counterparts. They will initially struggle learning a subject. But once they learned the basic data chunks, it is much easier for them to manipulate these to create new ideas.

It was from south carolina. I can't work jobs that deal with cash registers or dividing, or reading. I will practice very hard for hours and hours and sometimes the knowledge sticks for an hour, then I forget and have to painstakingly count on my fingers.\n\nI just applied for a job at goodwill as a production worker and it mentions doing 'simple math' dividing by 10's and 100's. That isn't simple for me at all. I dropped out in high school and I have no idea how I survived until that far. I think in the 6th grade the principal forced me to withdrawal from summer school and bumped me up to the 7th grade because I had already failed once and she got tired of me failing or something.

Unless they can provide some sort of special training for me to do first, then I will. \n\nI don't know if they will make me work on the cashier, but I always try to do stocking jobs so I don't deal with people that often. I just want to be alone and stock things. I don't mind counting and organizing but if I have to multiply or divide, then the job isn't right and I will fail. \n\nSometimes I feel like I want to bang my head against a wall in frustration or pull my hair out, although I never have done this, it's just an overwhelming feeling like no one understands me and like I am stuck this way forever and managers never hire me.

I am not downing housekeepers or janitors btw, they are amazing people but the work for me, I am sick of it. I want something different and I can't get hired. \n\n\nWhat I am wondering is- This job, should I tell them I may have a learning disability so I can't work as a cashier?

The instructors/coaches would show me a move (eg- a martial arts sequence) and expect me to repeat it. Which I always fail to do.  They would get frustrated and angry most of the time thinking that I don\u2019t pay enough attention. But in reality I am paying full attention but I fail to hold a sequence of instructions in my mind. I have to practice it slowly at my own pace for many number of times to remember it. So, I had to stop many things mid-way because I had to prioritize on my school education and didn\u2019t have that much time to do both.\n\nHowever, even with all this I managed to get good grades in my school work. I got mostly A\u2019s in my ordinary level exam (edexcel) and 3A\u2019s and a B for by Advanced Level for Chemistry, Biology, Maths and Physics respectively. This was possible through a very hard work etiquette and using a multitude of learning techniques (eg- mnemonics, visualization, spaced repetition software anki etc) I didn\u2019t go to school for like 1/3 of the semester because I found it very hard learning in a class room. Halfway into a lesson I would forget the beginning of the lesson and would lose continuity.  Only way for me to study is learn at my own phase using techniques. Teachers would say I don\u2019t pay attention, I am careless etc. But in the end of the day I got a good grade at the end of my Advanced Level exams.\n\nI was also diagnosed with depression during my A Level years. I went to a therapist who suggested doing CBT.  In CBT I identified that my biggest negative belief is that my short term memory weakness will prevent me from being successful in life.  But I was never able to challenge it. Whatever I did this belief loomed over me. And every problem I faced in life due to this seemed to reinforce this belief.  However, naturally my depression became moderate and only springs up in times of stress. \n\nThen I moved out of home to go to university. I select computer science as my major. I didn\u2019t have a childhood dream to do CS. I was always passionate about science and about creating new things.  But I didn\u2019t want to spend 6 years of my life pursuing a PHD. I wanted something I can get in directly after undergraduates. In fields like biology, chemistry, psychology graduate studies is a must if you want to get a good job. So the only candidates were accounting/finance, engineering and computer science. I had no interest in business so I chose CS. And long story short it didn\u2019t go very well.  I found the subject matter overwhelming even while using many study techniques.  Around 2/3 into the semester I kind of gave up due to too much pressure. I ended up failing most of the subjects.  This further shattered my self-esteem. \n\nSome say I should reduce my work load and continue on my course others say I should find a field that I am good at.  Now I am sitting in the cross roads unable to decide. My problems with short term memory applies equally to whatever I learn.  Although I think I am much weaker in abstract subjects like maths compared to subjects memorizing subjects like biology.\nBut above all my main weakness is my self-doubting.  Thinking that I\u2019ll not succeed due to it.  And I don\u2019t have friends who have similar problems. So, I am looking for role models whom I can look up to.

She get irritated with repeating things, with me saying words the wrong way, that I have trouble with left and right, getting confused when she explains plans to me, and also gets annoyed when I don't make sense explaining myself. So, this irritation has gone on for years and I constantly had to explain to her about my ADHD and my disabilities. She just thought it was an excuse. So the big moment that got to me was during a trip to Dinsey and waiting in line. She wanted a photo of me, but I got confused by her directions on where she wanted me to stand. She got annoyed and this led to me saying \"I do have learning disabilities you know right\". She then said that it's kind of \"concerning\" as that her family is academically inclined in terms of me fitting in and possibly our children inheriting something. This hurt my feelings so much and I couldn't believe how shallow she could be about it! So, we argued we eventually dropped it. So, it seems like my wife will never understand my disabilities.

When he was born the doctors predicted that he would never be able to communicate verbally and would be on SSDI for his entire life.  However, my brother (thanks to my mom\u2019s tireless efforts) has surpassed all expectations: he communicates as if he had no disabilities; he graduated high school and even obtained an associate\u2019s degree.  At this point, he doesn\u2019t qualify for federal assistance (to my knowledge, which I admit is limited). \nIn a weird way, his success has also led to some challenges. In high school, he became very interested in being in the military/law enforcement \u2013 a career path that is not very suited to his personality.  He\u2019s a very punctual and hardworking person, but emotionally he is not a very confident person and does not handle confrontation well at all (he tends to cry when people get upset with him); qualities that are quite necessary to a career in these fields.  He does take direction very well and works best when there is little decision-making and a structured routine as his disability affects his higher reasoning skills.  In his attempts to start a career in this field, he has failed the written exams to enlist in the military numerous times, but was able to put himself through peace officer academy training and passed all of the requirements.  He has worked in security before, but it never pays enough for him to financially support himself.  When my mom and I have tried to have him consider other fields, he seems unaware that his personality might limit his options, especially in this field. \nI feel like it\u2019s my fault for his situation.  I chose to go down this same career path, criminal justice, which I believe sparked his interest in the field.  I\u2019m wondering how I can best help him find a career that meets his interests and his personality.  Maybe it\u2019s not possible \u2013 if that\u2019s the case, how do I go about explaining to him that his limitations (which he is semi-aware of) might mean that he can\u2019t work in a field that he admires so much?

Recently I went to see the university psychologist because I suspected that I have a learning difficulty for quite some time.\n\nMy main symptoms were weak short term memory. So that means difficult to remember sequence of instructions, names etc. My long term memory is fine though. And very bad sense of direction which I think is related to the above. I get lost easily. Relies on GPS. Have to travel a route around 10 times to get familiar with it. And have to repeat a many number of times than others to develop skills.\n\nBased on the symptoms the psychologist assumed that I may not be put into a separate learning disability (eg- dyxlexia, adhd) since my symptoms are varied. So even if I do a testing probably I won't get any disability support. It costs $650 to get tested here and I didn't do it yet because it won't help me. (except for mental resolve by knowing who I am) \n\nI was having depression for a while as well. The counceller helped me identify negative thought patterns that were causing it.\n\nThe most prominent ones were\n\n1)My learning difficulty with hinder me from succeeding professionally in life. (I enrolled to study Computer Science)\n\n2)I won't be able to date attractive girls. I feel like half a man. A man who is terrible at navigation. Men are supposed to be excellent at it. Why would a pretty girl want to be with a man like that etc.\n\nThe psychologist suggested that in order to challenge these thoughts I should do a experiment. He told me to find the answers  for these questions.\n\n1)Are there people with terrible working memory and other difficulties succeeded in professional life. Find out about them.\n\n2)Are there men with bad navigational skills dating pretty women.\n\nHe told me that   finding guys who have succeeded the above with  learning disabilities would help me challenge my beliefs.  This is part of the Cognitive Behavioral therapy if any of you are wondering.\n\nSo, I posted this here since I didn't really know any other place to find the answers. Thanks in advance guys.

I've recently realized something about my university grades, and I was wondering if maybe I should go see somebody on my campus to talk about learning disability testing. \n\nHere's my story:\nFor as long as I can remember, I've been sorted into the \"smart kid\" group in public education (GT, AP classes, whatever, the way we sort kids in US public schools and fabricate expectations/futures for them is entirely BS IMO but that's another story for another time), and have never really considered how **hard** I have to work, it feels, compared to my peers when studying for multiple choice exams. I'm in my second year in university now, and have noticed something peculiar with my grades, and I'm wondering if maybe I should go see the nice folks in our disability center, but am wanting some advice before I head in. I entered university a STEM major, nearly failed out, and dealt with major depression regarding this near academic expulsion (after having been labeled a \"smart kid\" for my entire life, hitting a brick wall of near total failure for apparent incompetency was really hard to come to terms with). I've since switched to Liberal Arts, and am doing much better both academically and emotionally. However, after this latest round of midterms, I found myself rather disappointed with a C on a test I studied really, really hard for (and made a 95 on the corresponding paper), and I'm wondering, is there a learning disability that could lead to someone being really, really terrible at multiple choice testing? Here's my grade report from my 3 semesters thus far in university. http://i.imgur.com/MiR9ooV.png The courses in yellow are the ones with writing-based testing, while the others have been strictly multiple choice testing. Should I seek testing? Is this a thing, or am I just really bad at multiple choice exams?

It\u2019s sorta just one of those things that\u2019s really effected every facet of my life and made me feel extremely alienated. I can\u2019t really talk about it much without bursting into tears.

And I think I might have it.\n\nI know there's a lot off with my crazy brain. I have ADHD and OCD, sensory issues, APD, misophonia. And I have a slow processing speed on top of that, with issues in writing and spelling. But even though that sounded like dyslexia, I never really identified with most of the struggles of actual dyslexics that couldn't be explained by my other issues, namely my ADHD. And those issues didn't stop me from being a good writer or reader. Oddly enough, reading upside down helps my comprehension tremendously, but.... let's get back on topic.\n\nI was distracted by a post describing dysmusia, and suddenly I remembered when I'd be trying to read sheet music in violin and choir classes and completely being unable to match up the notes to the sounds. Even the kids around me who complained about it being difficult didn't seem to have too much of a problem doing exercises that involved matching up sounds to notes. It just seemed like a language I didn't have the mental machinery to comprehend, and I only got through those exercises by relying on my friends in those classes. This problem has persisted all my life, and I just had to give up piano after a couple of weeks because even though I could make myself memorize the letters, I could never get to the point where I could just match those up with sounds. \n\nI know it's not exactly a monstrously debilitating disorder (I have enough of those already so I don't exactly mind!), but I've been finding out more and more about how different I think compared to most people. Hell, I was only diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago. If anyone knows anything about this, I'd love to hear your knowledge and/or experiences.

I try and read something and it just doesn't go in. I always examed well previously but now they're all fails- even when I think I've done great (I get 100% extra time sometimes. A one hour exam will be two for me. They're also done alone.)\n\nI read pages and nothing goes in, revising doesn't work, even the simplist tasks are just too hard.

I can't even comprehend basic instructions on the phone half of the time.\n\nI've been homeless on and off for a few years now because of my condition and Ive kept together amazingly. My finances are better than anyone else my age and everyone says I'm the most mature and grown up person they know despite being the youngest.

I work in Mental Health and Education in the UK so I wonder if its a country difference. The way we use the term 'learning disability' it means anything that causes a person to have an IQ of under 70 (such as downs syndrome). Things like dyslexia we would call 'learning difficulties' because in the UK a disability must have a severe effect on your ability to carry out normal everyday tasks while dyslexia is a very specific issue which doesn't impact your ability to get dressed, get the bus, talk to people etc.   \nWhere are you from and what words do you use to differentiate?

said things. \n\nMy comprehension problems usually jump when having to read any longer text. I can read the words perfectly, no problems with pronunciation or understand the definition of individual words, yet when it comes to making sense of a whole sentence or whole text, I'm stuck. I often have to reread sentences 4-5 times and get frustrated by it because it never clicks. Sometimes I have to get someone else to read it and explain what a piece of text is telling me. It's like I don't have any other problems with written language (my handwriting is nice, spell words correctly, can read a sentence perfectly and with perfect tone adjusted to match punctuation within a sentence) but I cannot understand what I'm reading at all!\n\nTeachers call on me to read in class and I can read but when I'm asked to explain what I've just read, I'm sitting there looking stupid because I have no idea what I just read. It's like I forget every word before I read the next, there's no connection being made to know what the sentence is trying to say. I'm a rather slow learner. It also happens when people are speaking to me. I may take longer to respond because I'm having to assign meaning to phrases to interpret what someone is saying to me. It doesn't happen all of the time, but it happens enough for people to know that they might need to say it again or rephrase their sentence. \n\nI've been diagnosed with anxiety. I also regularly experience symptoms of major depressive disorder, ADD/ADHD, most autism traits you'd recognize in females, and oscillating (extreme to not as bad) social anxiety. However, I've never been to a doctor to find out if I have these things (no insurance, family doesn't believe I experience these issues.) My short-term memory also isn't the best and I've experienced most of this probably since second grade. \n\nI just want to know, what am I experiencing? Why can I not comprehend sentences? I've seen people on here explain similar situations but they usually have other experiences such as bad writing, slow typer, and other things that affect their reading comprehension more clearly than how I can identify my problem.\n\nI hope this makes sense. Can anyone point me into the right direction to figure out what could be causing this problem? It affects my learning drastically and reading overwhelms to the point I feel it keeps me from understanding even more!

I always have been told I'm above-average in intelligence, but I've never gotten good grades and have never gotten better than a 70% on any test I've taken, no matter how hard I study or how much I am passionate about the subjects. I always get to watch people that I honestly wouldn't trust to hold a corn chip for more than 5 seconds get these easy A's and lose their minds if they get a B. They seem to get along without any effort and it's so infuriating that I end up crying after class extremely often. Just being in class sends my mind into a downward spiral due to stress. \n\nNo matter how often my professors explain something, I can't understand what they're talking about. I can't match what comes out of their mouths with what I'm told to read. Nothing connects up. I often find myself unable to focus and remember anything they say while they talk, but I have an immensely difficult time reading for prolonged periods of time even with learning how to actively read. My brain just sounds like a fork smashed into a garbage disposal and I can't even remember anything about topics I do understand, or at least any words or terms used for the idea that's floating in my head. \n\nI can't hear poetic feet or meters, I can't identify numbers spoken verbally and I can't read numbers myself. 181,000. I know exactly how much that is. I can't say it. I just can't. The words don't work and I've had to spell out numbers like a moron on calls to my bank and it makes me feel so stupid and small that it makes me start bawling once I'm off the phone. I can't remember how to properly organize my words vocally, though I'm only marginally better on the keyboard. I'm sure that's showing now. I can kind of get a point across on here, but if I speak sometimes my sentence will come out so jumbled that even I don't know what I just said. \n\nI'm so stressed out because I feel like I can't keep up or do school anymore, and I don't think anyone will diagnose me since I'm just a young woman and most doctors I meet just tell me that girls like me never understand anything about themselves or their bodies and tells me its 'hormonal' without even checking me. My parents are also very fundamentalist Christians and I'm scared my dad will try to institutionalize me again if he learns there's yet another thing wrong with the oldest daughter that was supposed to be able to marry and give him a grandson quick. I rebelled by trying to learn but I keep failing and I'm scared I have to be something I don't want to be because I won't be able to make my place in the world. I hate being in class and just the thought of doing homework makes me want to jump off a bridge. I don't like the way I live and I'm so terrified that I'm going to fail at this. I have no friends because I can't remember anything and I have such a hard time talking. I haven't felt this way since high school. I don't know what to do, and I'm so frustrated and emotional all the time that I honestly don't think I'll be able to ever understand other people nor will they understand me. \n\nThis probably doesn't make any sene and doesn't belong here. I'm sorry. I'll make sure to delete this later because I don't want to be that whiny kid taking away from people who actually suffer in school. I'm sorry again for venting and leaving a text wall, but I'm hopeless and I don't know that I'll ever get better or if theres something wrong with me.\n\nEDIT: Really sorry if this sub is for diagnosed LDs and this is inappropriate given I haven\u2019t gone in to be tested.

Health issues that affect my whole body. I'm 29 now and still can't hold a job. I've never had friends only acquaintances. Even now the person I'm \"friends\" with is fucked up too. I've known her for years. I still don't understand body language (embarrassed a couple couple\u200b of weeks ago), don't (never been taught, only know my own observation) dating, Etc. LGBT community doesn't really like disabled people. Apparently I'm negative because I can't do a lot of things others can and if I dare \"complain\" I'm the problem. I try to explain but no one listens to me as usual my whole life. They don't have my brain and memory issues due this shit learning disability. Hell, I probs have slight Autism too. I'm always called weird and not in a good way. I've had teachers, doctors, my family, Etc look at me strangely for the way I speak or do things. Embarrassed to be seen with me in stores. I can't always stop talking because I don't know to interpret things differently ( do have some possession of visual learning). NVLD definitely gets worse with age even if I was in treatment. I have been having a lot flare ups from my autoimmune disease lately and it's making irritable. People don't want to understand or try to see my reasons for the way they always say I'm making excuses even though I'm not or they don't know me (I barely know me). Don't feel like I have an identity. I hate Reddit and wished I never joined. If I come on this site to get off what's on my mind I get told I'm complaining. My family isn't the kind you talk things with and it's awkward if you attempt it. I'm the LGBT in my family. I didn't know until 23. Didn't know I had NVLD until 23 and the Nueropsychologist didn't even understand NVLD at the time to try to explain what it is and now I realize why therapy over the years since my teens never helped because no one literally understands it. Especially for adults. My mom thought I was Autistic at 3. My brothers have always been abusive of some way in my life and don't talk to me because of their embarrassed of me. No one cares or wants to listen because they think you're just making excuses. Reddit folks fuck you thinking you know anything about me. Fuck this site. I'm done. I got no one\u200b to vent too.

I am 32 and only now learning this about myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring a conversation with my mother about older sisters and how to deal with them, she dropped a bomb on me about the issues I had in school as a child.\n\nI know I had learning disabilities and such. I had something called an \"IEP\" in school, was in \"self contained\" classes in middle school and had a special study class every year of highschool instead of one elective that was just to finish homework.\n\nBut I never knew the *names* of what I had, I don't know if knowing more of these details would have changed anything in my adult life, but I feel like they'd have been answers to questions I'd always had about my intelligence and personality.\n\nI found out about a year ago, from a cousin who stayed with us one summer 25 years ago, that I was dyslexic. She mentioned it in a FB comment and I was like, \"What? No\"  \nBut she remembers it well because she had to read to me when she baby sat and my mom explained to her why that was, even though I was too old to be read to (compared to other kids)\n\nThat really upset me to only find this out YEARS later.  \nMaybe I could have used that for leverage when I took too long to write notes or something in college  \n(I know I could have leveraged my old IEP, but the system changed over the years and it'd just be easier to tell the teacher I was dyslexic instead of going through the bureaucracy)\n\nLast night was another big one, about how I had Dysgraphia and the lady who I thought was just watching me after school when I was little was actually the **Principle of my elementary school** who was using me as like, a prototype for a new learning program she wanted to implement.  \nWHAT?\n\nAlso my mom is working with some people who are going to start up a study on autistic adult brains who underwent early intervention and wanted me to give them a call to see if I can join in.  \n**WHAT!?**\n\nSo apparently those silly tests I was given every year of my life until I left high school, putting together puzzles, reading back series of numbers from memory, describing what feelings a picture of a person had on their face, and many more, were actually to like, gauge where I was on the autism spectrum and oh, by the way, yeah you have asperger's but it was mild and we were keeping an eye on you, so it's not like it was ever a big deal, she says.\n\n WHAT WHAT WHAT!?!  \nIs that why I had to go to all those lessons where I just like, had to look at people talking and try to explain what they were talking about?   \nIs that why I didn't really \"get\" sarcasm until I was a teenager? Is that why I literally have had maybe 3 friends in 30 years?!  \nI always assumed I was just a little off, but it was still just my own failings.  \nNow the week I turn 32 years old, I find out that I actually was different?!  \nThat the only reason I'm normal enough is because of the amount of time, effort, and energy that the adults in my life put into making me as normal as possible, and I NEVER KNEW.  \nIs that why my mother was always telling me that I'm lucky that I'm so fortunate because so many others didn't get the help they needed?  \nIs that why my family was always so shocked and proud whenever I'd just be reading a book as a kid?  \nIs that why their standards for me have been **SOO LOW** my entire life?!  \nLiterally  get your GED, don't get knocked up, don't become an addict, have a job/don't go into debt.  \nThat's as much as is ever been expected of me, never a push to get out of the house, go out on dates, move out on my own, it's just always been expected that I'd live with my mom forever, never get married or start a family, and never get a job where I'd be able to live independently.\n\nI don't know if this is even the right place to vent about this, but I don't actually have anyone to complain about this to.\n\nI can't help but feel like it was wrong to not so much keep it a secret, but just not tell me about it all.  \nMaybe I could have found others like me, maybe people would have been more understanding and patient with me.\n\nMaybe she made the correct decision, maybe if I'd known I would have thoughtlessly blabbed about it and come off as weird.  \nThings are different now, where bullying is acknowledged as being wrong, but when I was a kid \"sped\" kids were openly mocked and if I was crying in the middle of class, it'd just annoy the teacher.\n\nI just feel conflicted.\n\noh by the way, I have a BS in microbiology, minoring in biotech and chem. I'm a sysadmin at a pharmaceutical company and am just about caught up with others my age who finished their degree in the normal amount of time, not the decade it took me. But then again, many of them don't live with mom and are married with kids.\n\n..... but I paid for my education all on my own and have ZERO debt of any kind, so I can be pleased about that.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1586, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just found out that I had all these severe learning issues as a child, over 20 later", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/iw4eyt/just_found_out_that_i_had_all_these_severe/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tavukveben", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_yu0oc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1600533090, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/ivvrez/can_i_request_to_have_my_teachers_do_zoom_classes/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ivvrez", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/ivvrez/can_i_request_to_have_my_teachers_do_zoom_classes/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1600533101, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have ADHD, Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, and SPD\n\nIt's nearly impossible for me to read.

I was never able to socially interact with others the way my peers would. Always going back over what I\u2019d said and the faces people made to indicate that they just don\u2019t get me. I went to university late in life, and because they were willing to grant me some basic accommodations I was able to do well.\n\nI graduated with my first degree with a 3.86GPA and busted my back to do it. I completed my next level degree with a 3.95GPA. That was difficult and took me much longer than my peers, but I did it.\n\nProblems at work have always been an issue. I obviously don\u2019t learn the way others do, I don\u2019t catch on at the same speed as others. My bosses get frustrated because they don\u2019t get why I do my work and my output is very good, but it takes me more time than they\u2019d like and they think I\u2019m slacking off or something. I\u2019ve previously told them I think differently than others. Mostly it\u2019s been after being asked \u201cHow did you come up with a cool idea like that?\u201d I just say I\u2019m wired differently. My boss is really really smart, mind like a steel trap, and he probably doesn\u2019t get me and my outside-the-box thinking at all. I feel like if I tell them officially that I learn differently they\u2019ll find a way to fire me so they don\u2019t have to deal with me and my differences. I know, it\u2019s crazy. But it\u2019s been my experience that I\u2019m the round peg in the square hole that nobody wants to bother putting any additional effort into.\n\nStigma sucks. \n\nOn top of the LD\u2019s, I also have mental health issues for which I am treated, finally, with something that\u2019s working.

I could have not said much at all but I said stuff in my group.\n\nIt makes me feel horrible that I always screw up somehow.\n\nThen we had to do our presentation for our activity.

She is a very immature 20 year old female who may show signs of slight autism or a learning disability. Here are some things we have noticed - please give your opinion on what she might have, if anything.\n\nAs I said, she is 20 years old but has the maturity of a 13 year old.\n\nHas trouble focusing and gets bad grades in school. She will watch videos/movies for hours or can draw for hours. She is very artistic (and is very good) but sometimes gets very hyper focused to the point where she doesn't seem to hear anything else and can get very frustrated with it sometimes.\n\nHas trouble managing time and being on time. I recognize a lot of people get distracted and have this problem, but there seems to be a lack of understanding and awareness around when it is appropriate to leave the house to be on time for example.\n\nHas trouble following directions and can be very forgetful. She will also get lost easily, or forget where the car is when returning. \n\nShe has very low self esteem and thinks of herself as very different and weird.\n\nWhat is most telling to us is her social skills, which are very lacking. She can talk constantly for hours and doesn't seem to understand or pick up on social cues or any non-verbal signs from the other person. What she talks about is also very inappropriate for the time and place, and will ask questions about a person in a very non-organic way.

About 2nd grade. However as I progressed into grade levels that taught more advanced math, I began to notice how I was treated differently.\n\nWhen I began learning pre-algebra in 8th grade, my class was split between those who were ready for Algebra I and those who weren't as up to speed. I was in the latter class, but I still fell behind my peers. Eventually my teacher, the principal and my mom decided to have me graded on a \"pass/fail\" system becasue they felt that I would not be able to obtain the minumum \"C\" grade. I even used a different textbook and got different homework from everyone else.\n\nWhen I attended High school, I did pretty well with my first class, it being \"consumer math\". When it was time for me to complete algebra requirement for graduation, the principal, my homeroom teacher, the special Ed. teacher and mom decided to make an exception for me and waive the requirement so I could graduate. So I never took algebra in high school.\n\nWhen I attended community college I learned Algebra 1 for the first time (of course after completing 2 other remedial math courses).  It was at this time where I learned that it was normally taught in high school. \n\nTo this day I still can't do algebra, (or fractions or division.)\n\nWhile I think I should be happy about these decisions my mom and educators made, deep down it makes me feel sad. It was as if my disability was so bad that they felt moving the goalposts closer was the better option to helping me meet the standards. I felt pitied.

The biggest note I got is suggesting I double check my work for typos and what not. The problem is I HAVE been doing that already, in fact I've been triple checking my work. Because of my learning disability I have always had a really hard time with this. In school I would just get someone to read over my stuff at the writing center on campus, sometimes twice, and I never thought about what would happen when I didn't have available. In fact I've been spending time that I don't even record for work (anywhere from half an hour to 5 hours) consistently every day, trying to catch my mistakes because I've been working from home. I've also been skipping most of my breaks (obviously not the one I'm taking to write this) and I still can't keep up. Upon being given this performance review I also was told I will no longer be able to work from home due to COVID. I could try using a screenreader but I won't be able to do it on the graphics programs I'm working on and some of the stuff isn't going to be caught by just using a screenreader if I export it and run it as a pdf. I'm also really concerned how to explain to my boss why I would need that. At all my other jobs before it's never ever been an issue because they just weren't as fast paced and so I always had time to check everything thoroughly (also the projects were smaller and that seemed to help a lot) . The 6 months I've been working for this company I've have down time once and it's because someone else locked me out of the office and I was stuck until someone came and opened it up for me. I'm paid hourly so I can't just keep working after my shift. Please help, I have no idea what to do.\n\nEdit: The programs I use are ARCgis and the Adode Suites, they are not word processing programs. Still I'm messing up a lot on the labels I have to make on those programs. From what I understand there is no screenreader that works with them. I'm also worried about how much time it would take if I was exporting and importing into a screenreader (this is my second and last mini break so I won't be able to update for a while).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1466, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My learning disability is impacting my job.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/humy8g/my_learning_disability_is_impacting_my_job/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "wls": 7}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Flying-Pasta", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6pb28z7c", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594997549, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/hsx190/does_anyone_else_have_trouble_getting_thoughts/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hsx190", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/hsx190/does_anyone_else_have_trouble_getting_thoughts/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 7, "retrieved_on": 1594997560, "score": 1, "selftext": "I really struggle with this, I can't seem to express my thoughts to others or where people can understand what I mean, it makes people really confused and they often misinterpret me thinking I mean something completely different than what I'm actually trying to say.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1464, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does anyone else have trouble getting thoughts out both verbally and when written?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/hsx190/does_anyone_else_have_trouble_getting_thoughts/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "wls": 7}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Longjumping-Size-762", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8sapqs2e", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1643322186, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/seagaf/what_would_this_ld_be_called/", "gildings": {}, "id": "seagaf", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/seagaf/what_would_this_ld_be_called/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1643322197, "score": 1, "selftext": "With the exception of math (I have dyscalculia), I always tested above average everywhere else.

statistical course that\u2019s compulsory in first year I avoided it for so long because my disadvantage of mathematics and statistical language I would struggle. So I attempted my very last semester of uni, I gave it a shot. Once founding out I failed it took me a few days to get the courage and ask how close was I from passing. My course coordinator said \u201cyou were so close from passing 49/50 to pass. I will be supportive for you in any way I can\u201d \n\nI decided to look up what I could do found out I can make an appeal against my final grade result. So I did that, and it seems to be a struggle to find 1 mark for me. My course coordinator isn\u2019t feeling confident and asked if I prefer resetting the final exam, I told him I would rather do the assignment that wasn\u2019t given an extension for me when I asked for it earlier and got an awful mark from it (I\u2019m usually allowed extension, documentation provides me extra time on my assignments, he\u2019s the only lecturer that\u2019s declined my extension throughout my whole degree) I actually did my final exam reasonably well considering no reader/writer was involved for me, and redoing it since it\u2019s been so long I\u2019ll probably won\u2019t do so well.\n\nNow I wait today for final attempt of what my course coordinator can do asking student disability services, considering against my odds I was close to passing. Not given my accommodation seems fair to let me pass so I can graduate.\ud83d\ude14 \n\nI\u2019ve stayed in contact with my student advocacy, team leader, he\u2019s also making contact about it today. \n\nIf everything goes south, then I message the Dean of the faculty.

I\u2019m just kinda frustrated and Upset with myself, blaming myself for everything. To get into the nursing program in my university, you must get the best grades in your prerequisites courses - Like having mainly A\u2019s and Some B\u2019s. I already received support from the Office of Disability Services. I have not been doing well enough in my prerequisites- well to the nursing program standards tbh. I have been getting all B\u2019s in my prerequisites, maintaining a 3.5 GPA while suffering from constant chronic pain and headaches in which affects my learning while having an LD at the same time. Unfortunately, I have to retake a course next semester just because I had an B- in the course -_-\n\nI\u2019ve tried everything to improve my grades but I feel such a failure. I hate college, I\u2019m not having fun - I see so many people going to club meetings &amp; Meeting new people.

I don\u2019t think I can really explain much of anything I learned in 4 years of college. I had a similar issue in high school to a lesser degree, and now I notice I still have trouble retaining info at work while trying to learn about the industry and my job. \nI noticed throughout these years is my best way to learn things is through extreme repetition, and writing things out by hand over and over. To study for exams, I\u2019d almost write out entire book chapters word for word from the textbook onto a piece of paper, as it felt like the only way for the information to resonate with me. This would be great for short term memorization, but after a few weeks it would mostly fade away. \n\nI was diagnosed with ADD at a young age, and frequently went on and off medication for it. I currently am not on anything for it (considering getting back on though).\n\nI know this was an extremely general explanation, but does anyone know what my problem may be? Could it be linked to my ADD? As I struggle to retain much from reading a long text or listening to a long audio clip due to possibly being distracted?

Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, and Dysgraphia.\n\nRecently my IQ was tested using the WAIS IV in college. I was given an FSIQ and GAI score. I overall I almost hit the ceiling for most of the tests and was amazed by how easy some of the tests were. \n\nI was told that usually people with dyslexia score low for the coding subtest, but I managed to score slightly above average for coding and 145 or more for the other two subtests. Overall my processing speed was 155 removing the coding subtest and substituting it with a subtest called cancellation. My working memory was my lowest. 85 for arithmetic, 85 for letter number sequencing, and 97 for forward digit memory, 125 reverse, and 138 in sequential order. I think my overall working memory was 114. \n\nOld academic papers reveal that my reading comprehension and math abilities ranged from 70-89 when I was 10. My reading speed used to be 75 WPM (my reading speed is still bad but my reading comprehension has significantly increased).\n\nFor the perceptual reasoning index I managed to get a 145-150 and 137 for verbal comprehension index. For the verbal comprehension tests I scored the lowest on a test called information (100) a test that measures your general knowledge, 110 for similarities (verbal reasoning), 145 for a test called comprehension that measures social ability/\"common sense\" and 140 for vocabulary.\n\nMy FSIQ was 145 or between 139-149 with 95% confidence. The psychologist told me that it's better to interpret IQ as always changing depending on the situation/various factors so the confidence interval would be more accurate apposed to a fixed score.\n\nWhat's even more strange is that I took the SAT and scored a 900 timed without accomodations because I wasn't allowed to get accomodations in high school because I apparently need to get reevaluated to make sure I still have learning problems. I have good grades overall (scored 4 standard deviations on some standardized tests and since my grades overall were good I got an \"insignia\" for mastery in every subject) but a bad SAT score and therefore wasn't allowed to go to a good university. I'm attending community college and currently struggling with my English writing class, but getting and A in calculus with little to no studying. I'm considering abandoning academia because no one will take me seriously with community college education but I don't know where to turn to or what job to commit my life to or what I'm going to do with my life in general because I feel completely incompetent etc and honestly I don't know what to do as I'm not passionate about anything. I took the SAT untimed recently on my own and accommodated myself and managed a 1500. I feel confused as I thought I had slow processing speed because I scored so low on the SAT timed without accomodations and I'm a slow reader and bad at arithmetic, but accommodated I can score significantly higher. I don't know what to do. \n\nTLDR: It seems that the main issue for me is working memory. Has any other dyslexics etc have main problems with working memory apposed to processing speed as every article I encounter seems to talk about processing speed deficits but nothing about working memory.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 2554, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "IQ memory deficit and learning disability", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/r3375m/iq_memory_deficit_and_learning_disability/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Which_Register_7296", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_cxb1sti9", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1637977361, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/r326sv/whats_wrong_with_me/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r326sv", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/r326sv/whats_wrong_with_me/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1637977373, "score": 1, "selftext": "I live in a place where there is no such thing as a \u201clearning disorder\u201d iykwim.\nNow as an adult I\u2019m realising that I might have some sort of issue.\nWhenever people explain something to me, I don\u2019t understand it at all!

I also have OCD tendencies that I already have an appointment about, too, but I also feel like there's something else. Since I was a young kid, I've always struggled in school. I have a low failure tolerance and so the second I didn't understand something, I was in a ball of tears. The issue is that I often didn't understand things. I can remember specific times when words just didn't make sense. I often read things several times over and not because my mind wandered and I had to start over, but because I truly didn't understand what was written. I frequently add words, move words, and take words away when I read. I can tell something is off but I can't tell where or what's wrong. I have to just keep going and come back to it or even just move on and accept that I'm missing some information that may or may not be important. Half the time I don't even start reading at the beginning of a sentence or paragraph. \n\nMy experience understanding spoken language isn't any easier. I usually watch TV with subtitles. Even if the characters in the show don't have any kind of accent, it still sounds like they're trying to communicate with marbles in their mouth. Following written and spoken directions are difficult. I often need to reread or have the instructions repeated multiple times. This is only made worse when I'm trying to write what someone is saying. I can only focus on 3 or 4 words at a time. Any new words that get added to the end of the sentence cause the words at the beginning to be pushed right out of my mind. Even if they stop talking so I can catch up, the words that were lost are completely gone and then I can't think of anything similar to take it's place. It's like I'm unable to think for myself.\n\nAdditionally, if I'm being told about something that requires me to envision what they're describing, I can't picture it. For example, if a room is being rearranged and the person doing the rearranging with me has thought of a plan, as they walk me through what's in their head, I have to ask several questions to fill in blanks but only end up more confused. Even if I'm just trying to imagine how new curtains would look against white walls, I can't picture how it would look or how the style would compliment other objects in the room because I can't even picture the room. I'm like that with a lot of things. \"Out of sight, out of mind\" is very real for me. \n\nI also get lost and turned around extremely easily. It scares me everyday. Even while driving to a store I frequent, if I take a route that is one street over, I get lost and need to use a map. There's more things I experience that fall in line with these issues but this is all I can think of right now.

Or it'll take ages for me to come up with something; for example I'll have nothing to say during the conversation, but 5 mins later when I'm on my own a number of thoughts occupy my mind about what I \"should\" or \"could' have said. But other times, I'll have a rough idea of what I want to say, but I just won't be able to express myself articulately. Like, the way that I'm expressing myself in this post, for example, I definitely wouldn't be able to do the same thing verbally. I'm just incapable. Sure, I can say simple short sentences, but beyond that, not really.\n\nIt isn't an education problem either. I have a good grasp of English and it's my main language. I can construct sentences perfectly well when I'm sitting on my arse behind a screen.\n\nI don't know if this is a social skills thing, a social anxiety/confidence thing or a brain problem/disability thing. At the moment, I'm guessing that it's a combination of a brain problem and social anxiety. The brain problem prevents me from retrieving words quickly and spontaneously, and the anxiety perpetuates this when I'm in a social situation. But that's just conjecture on my part: I'm really not sure, and I've thought about this for such a long time so the lack of clarity is so incredibly frustrating.

For example, many professors/faculty often forget to give students their extended time, place responsibility on the student to remind them about their accommodations, and demonstrate a lack of understanding about disabilities. This lack of understanding often manifests as comments that are unintentionally degrading or shaming the student. More active forms of ableism may involve more serious acts of discrimination or prejudice purposefully done towards students with disabilities.\n\nI want to collect letters from various students with disabilities and read them on camera.  These notes will be open letters to colleges/professors/faculty talking about what you wish they knew about supporting students with disabilities. The goal of this project is to give colleges/professors/faculty a greater perspective regarding this issue.  In no way, will this film bash or shame any college/professors/faculty member.\n\nYou are welcome to write a letter of any length (even 1 sentence works!).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 2520, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ableism at Colleges - Final Project Survey for students with disabilities", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qtw7l7/ableism_at_colleges_final_project_survey_for/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TempCalcer", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gjan8350", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1636905497, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qtsqpx/postsecondary_student_with_pfasd_looking_for/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qtsqpx", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qtsqpx/postsecondary_student_with_pfasd_looking_for/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "removed_by_category": "moderator", "retrieved_on": 1636905508, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 2519, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Postsecondary student with pFASD looking for resources", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qtsqpx/postsecondary_student_with_pfasd_looking_for/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "snukwrx", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_137chzjl", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1636728175, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qscmu6/looking_for_help_for_a_dear_relative/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qscmu6", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qscmu6/looking_for_help_for_a_dear_relative/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1636728186, "score": 1, "selftext": "My Uncle is nearly 60 years old and has had a very hard life. His exact condition has never been fully diagnosed, potentially because he has so many symptoms and chronic issues, and he has only gotten worse as the years continue to tick by. \n\nOur family estimates he has the social maturity of about  an 8 year old, he has been diagnosed with dyscalculia which extends greatly to his ability to logically and critically think about anything and he is clinically blind in both eyes (He loves movies and TV and has to sit about 6 inches away from a TV or in the front row at a movie theatre to see anything). To make things more difficult for him his growth was stunted at a young age and he has been completely bling since he was about 16. \n\nAll that said, he is incredibly friendly and massively extroverted. He loves telling jokes and we comment often that he has the uncanny ability to carry on complex conversations that defy our understanding of his clinical diagnoses. We often forget for periods of time how handicapped he truly is, which makes it so much more difficult when something then happens that makes it immediately evident just how restricted he is. \n\nFor example, he loves beer. But every time he drinks even a single beer the next day he usually has a gout flare-up and has to deal with a good deal of pain and soreness. Yet he is incapable of making the connection between the two events. His ability to logically look at a situation just doesn't exist. \n\nNaturally, quarantine has been incredibly difficult for him. He has largely been isolated at home with his 80+ year old mother and has been deprived of his ability to socialize with almost anyone else besides family. \n\nNow that I have rambled through the background, if you're still with me I cant express how thankful I am, my ask is this: I'm looking for any kind of resource that exists that is some sort of digital playdate/get-together forum that he could dial into (zoom, skype, or similar mediums) on a regular basis and scratch his social itch. Is anyone out there aware of anything like that? Kind of a digital pen-pal. I'm aware of chat-roulette, but for anyone that's familiar with the platform we've avoided it for obvious reasons. \n\nThank you so much and hopefully something like this exists.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 2515, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for help for a dear relative", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qscmu6/looking_for_help_for_a_dear_relative/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "1000100001", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": "LD Mod", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1041aw", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1636630028, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qrj8fo/i_am_stepping_down_as_mod_of_rlearning/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qrj8fo", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qrj8fo/i_am_stepping_down_as_mod_of_rlearning/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1636630039, "score": 1, "selftext": " This community means a lot to me, but due to a health concerns I will be stepping down as mod.

Recently I've noticed that I have some serious mental issues with comprehension, etc. but I can't describe my problem or the symptoms properly enough to identify what the issue actually is. I think my inability to describe the issue is also a symptom of the issue itself.\n\nSo I'll begin by talking about comprehension. When reading something, I can fluently read every word on the page, but at times I can't comprehend it. Or at least, I can comprehend it only after exerting a lot of mental effort. Sometimes when for example reading a question, I'll have to sit there and actively exert all mental power to fit the concepts together in my brain and understand them.\n\nI'm not completely dumb. I try to read books often; it's just difficult for me to do so. It also extends beyond books to more general reading, such as social media, as well as just when I'm thinking on my own.\n\nI think comprehension is the key issue, so that's what I've described. Happy to answer questions that people have in the comments. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea what the issue might be?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 2485, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm convinced that I have a mental problem but I just can't describe what it is.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qewq6n/im_convinced_that_i_have_a_mental_problem_but_i/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "djjsxikdndndndn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_cgzo8u8m", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1635014793, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qeauqo/i_hate_my_learning_disability/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qeauqo", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qeauqo/i_hate_my_learning_disability/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "removed_by_category": "moderator", "retrieved_on": 1635014804, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 2484, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I hate my learning disability", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qeauqo/i_hate_my_learning_disability/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Cash-L", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_480ndue2", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1634929776, "domain": "youtube.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/qdny9u/good_video_on_ld_that_i_found/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qdny9u", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "It'stheApe", "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/c/ItstheApe", "height": 200, "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kY8QcYBS0s8?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "provider_name": "YouTube", "provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "thumbnail_height": 360, "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kY8QcYBS0s8/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_width": 480, "title": "Things Not to Say &amp; to Say to People With Learning Disabilities (Feat.

After my surgery, I was tested for any delays or disabilities and was diagnosed with Cognitive Disorder NOS. On top of that, at age 25 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.\n\nI'm really struggling with figuring out how my brain works. I was told over the years by therapists and doctor's that I am \"highly intelligent\" but lately I'm having trouble comprehending things the first time I read them and it takes about 2 or 3 times to process it. My short term memory is bad and always has been, but it feels worse lately. I'll forget things almost immediately after they happen. \n\nI know bipolar disorder apparently gets worse over time, but my meds really help me. Do learning disabilities get worse over time?

Thats the post. At first I had a big thing written out but I decided it wasnt worth posting.\n\nIt just makes me sad to see a subreddit for teachers with so much hate for students on it.\n\nI understand this is their community and they are just venting about their incredibly important job that they are chronically overworked and underpaid for, and that being a teacher is not easy, but it still makes me sad.\n\nThe most recent post I saw was making fun of students who cant spell and mocking the \"spelling doesnt matter\" saying. Ive seen posts complaining about IEPs and \"bad\", \"lazy\" students. Ive seen posts, of course, questioning ADHD diagnoses and going off about \"karen\" moms.\n\nI hate that being a teacher is the default job for someone to take because they dont know what to do with their history degree. I hate that teachers are forced to work 1 or 2 extra jobs because teaching doesn't pay the bills. I hate how underfunded education is (even here in Canada which always tries to pretend its better than the states) and how it trickles down to having a major negative impact on students with learning disorders, ADHD and other behavior disorders, physical disabilities, kids with bad home lives who show up to school tired or underfed, and other \"bad\" kids.\n\nI know many of you can relate to growing up as a \"bad kid\" despite loving to learn. I personally have had more than my fair share of experiences with teachers that have left a big impact on my (I posted another thread here about wanting to write a letter to my 6th grade teacher). Now that im an adult I also personally know friends, acquantances, co workers who have become or want to become the exact teachers that I feared growing up.\n\nThis post is just a vent I guess.

I'm a grad student studying education at Goddard College, and as part of my Learner Differences course, I'm focusing on how educators can better support neurodiverse students within the classroom!  I decided the best way to do that is to learn from neurodiverse folx experiences, and so created this survey. \n\n I'm really super passionate about this as my husband, and my two younger siblings are neurodivergent (hubby and little brother have ASD and ADHD, and my little sister has ADHD and anxiety), and I've seen them all struggle within the US education system not being able to meet their needs. I struggle to identify as ND myself since my PTSD shares the same symptoms that ADHD does, but I'm really suspicious that I have dyscalculia now that I've learned that exists. (Math and numbers have always been a nightmare for me.)\n\nThe survey should take 5 minutes, at minimum, if you skip all the optional questions. The survey has more information within it, but there aren't many required questions, and you can skip around all you like.  \n\n\nhttps://forms.gle/HbJDWucUwLJSjKR9A", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 2417, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Neurodiversity and Education Survey", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/pwqcq8/neurodiversity_and_education_survey/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LeoSunflower7", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4lca3le1", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1632725700, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/pwbqtg/i_lost_my_adolescence_because_of_undiagnosed/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pwbqtg", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/pwbqtg/i_lost_my_adolescence_because_of_undiagnosed/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1632725710, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm 30 and never had anyone show interest in me as a friend or anything.

Like a hitch in processing the signal that translates brain stimulus into movement, where the signal gets rerouted or deleted. Some examples:  trying to follow say an exercise routine, I'm watching a video and they're going right but my body wants to go left. I go left despite my wishes and smack into somebody beside me. I'm walking on the sidewalk, somebody comes up behind me on a bike and says, \"on your right!\" and my body goes right because I can't stop my momentum and can't interpret that as \"I should go left now\" so I crash into the bicyclist.\n\nI'm introduced to someone and then an hour later I mix them up with someone else. I'm walking along and talking with someone and somebody else comes up alongside me and I literally don't see them. I'm sitting down and waiting from somebody and they come right up to me and I don't see them until they alert me to their presence, even though I have normal vision corrected with glasses. I get directions on how to do a simple procedure and five minutes later I can't remember how to do it. I think one way and I go another way. I go to return some books at a library and when I get out it's dark and I can't find my friend's car. \n\nI'm going somewhere I've either never been before or I've been there a couple of times but I can't remember the layout of the buildings (school) and every single time I try to get to a specific building I get lost. I think I'm walking west when I'm actually walking east and walking away from the destination I want to get to, because in my mind west is east, so I miss the appointment. I'm scared of crossing the street against the signal because I can't tell how fast cars are going. I find learning to drive terrifying because I think I'm turning into one lane but it's actually the next lane over and I nearly plow into oncoming traffic. I see a car coming but then I realize afterwards that it was moving in the opposite direction. I try to walk up a down escalator. Now I'm an adult with a terminal degree that still has all these problems except there's no name for them. I've been plagued with these problems ever since I can remember. It's like most people automatically process right to left, left to right, etc. and I have to do it manually as it were. The only thing that's changed with age is awareness of a pattern but that awareness in no way comforts me or makes my errors less embarrassing. I get so tired of having to laboriously explain why I did such and such a thing which is incomprehensible to a neurotypical person that I prefer to not socialize. Maybe some of you can relate to a few of these things or most of them. I have a feeling even if I had a name for this processing error there's nothing I could do to change it because the source is hardwired.

I'm not good at following complex directions (Do A, B, C and then you have to do blah, blah blah, to get to 1, 2, 3) etc (sorry that's the best way I can explain it) I'm also terrible at remembering or taking mental notes on the order/steps you're supposed to do things and sometimes it takes me months if not years to finally learn certain things that most people can in minutes there's random simple tasks that I just can't do. I used to think my learning disabilities only affected me in math at school (dyscalculia) but I'm starting to realize just how much they're ruining my real life and I possibly might have an intellectual disability. I was never in special education but I do remember in elementary school I wasn't allowed to stay in math class I was always pulled aside and put in a small group of other kids that didn't move at a normal pace in math and I remember on a few occasions just staring at the paper not being able to understand the numbers and crying. My parents never got help for me because they believed I was lazy, not trying hard enough, or just uninterested at the time they didn't believe learning disabilities were real and my older brothers who also have them went through hell for it and only in recent years have they finally thankfully realized the seriousness of them. When I started high school in 2019 I was basically failing every class so my mom took me to get an evaluation from a company that helps disabled kids called brain balance but ultimately we weren't able to finish or get my final results because they wanted $24,000 and we can't afford it. That was the only time I ever came close to getting officially diagnosed and I don't know how else to or where to go or how to explain it all. My school situation has fortunately got better because my mom was able to get a job and pay for me to go to a school that helps kids who want to learn at their own pace in a non traditional way.\n\nBut back to the main point of this post is how it has affected me working. I know its not a life or death situation if I'm not working right now since I'm still in high school but personally its very important to me that I am since I'm trying to save because I'm in a very unbearable living situation at home. So I got my very first job this June at a fast food restaurant and I only lasted 4 days. The had me bagging the food, making drinks, correcting orders, washing dishes, cleaning bathrooms, mopping, and helping customers in the dining room and correcting orders which was super easy and I believed I was doing a good job. (keep in mind all of these tasks were in the job description when I signed the papers) but on my last day a coworker was telling me \"You know you're gonna be on the headset in drive thru soon right?\" and I said \"No I'm not\" (because that is NOT what I was getting paid for) and she said \"Oh yes you are\" demandingly and I recall earlier the manager was rushing me to help the customers in the dining room and he was complaining about my pace and saying I need to hurry up and learn this so he can switch me to the drive thru headset cashier instead of the front end dining room server (Every other manager I worked with the first 3 days said I was doing a good job this guy was just an asshole.) Then as I was about to finish washing dishes at the end of the day he told me to come talk to him in his office so I finished up and went in and he goes on and on and on about how I'm wasting the company's money, and you need to pick up the pace so I can put you on the drive thru (when I never agreed to that and specifically was only hired to work in the dining room because I knew I would make too many mistakes and get overwhelmed on the headset the hiring manager even told me all my duty's and never said I would have to do the headset) so he basically just complained to me the whole day then at the end of my shift called me in to complain some more and tried to pressure me to work in an area that wasn't even part of my job description when he didn't even train me in the first place so I called him the next day and let him know I wouldn't return If they wanted drive thru workers they should've put CASHIER in the job title not dining room customer service rep &amp; dishwasher. \n\nNow my second job I actually agreed to be a cashier at a grocery store my mom knew some people that worked there since they moved here 17 years ago and everyone in my neighborhood shops there so it seemed like a nice environment and I knew I'd be comfortable. This time they \"trained\" me but it was only through watching videos about safety for 8 hours. All the managers really did every day was sit in the office on their phones and on my first day they gave me my uniform and just told me to start working. THANK GOD one of my co workers was really really nice about it and showed me slowly step by step patiently on how to use the cash register and anytime I had a problem she would just correct it for me and explain what to do if it happens again so I was able to learn the basics of the cash register due to her help but unfortunately we barely had the same shifts so I had to become independent very quickly since no one else wanted to help. So maybe 2 weeks go by of working a few days here and there and everything is fine I don't have too many problems and I'm finally getting the hang of things until the day that I had no idea would be my last. It was a regular day everything had gone by fine it was pretty busy but I was okay with that. This woman comes through my line and purchase's two $200 visa gift cards and everything is fine. An hour later she comes back and wanted me to ring up 4 $200 gift cards and I think nothing of it since she brought some earlier and probably just needed some more. This time she shows me some kind of master card cash card and tells me to follow the directions on it I scan the gift card one by one like the directions said and tell her the total is then she slides her card in the credit card swiper we do this 3 more times and she told me since its a cash card just ring it up as a cash transaction and each time she swiped her card. Everything is fine and I finish the rest of my shift no problem. I come back the next day and an hour goes by then I get a call to come to the office some guy I have never seen before tells me to sit down shows me a visa gift card and asked me if anyone brought them the day before I say yes he says she didn't actually pay for them the second time and since I let her walk out with $900 worth of gift cards he has to terminate me. He asked how I didn't realize it was a scam I told him it was because she had already purchased them before so I didn't think anything of it and because she was swiping her \"cash card\" then he tells me she tricked me the second time and only paid for the first. Looking back I probably should have realized this once she and raised her voice at me to read the directions and I explained that to him that she seemed a little aggressive (but working in fast food an retail you're used to being talked to like that so I shook it off) and he said you should have asked a supervisor for help (THERE WERE NONE THERE AT THE TIME THIS WAS HAPPENING AND I DID NOT REALIZE WHAT SHE WAS DOING.) and I wouldn't be surprised if the reason the scammer chose my line was because it was obvious that I was a new hire and I was the youngest person working there alone and obviously some new teenager is more gullible than the adult cashiers that were on the other end of the store plus the way my brain functions doesn't help the situation any more because I genuinely did not realize it was a fraud. Okay lets hire a teenager and give her no training besides some robbery safety videos from 2006, sit in out office all day doing nothing, have no supervisors this day to monitor or check up on her, and put her on the register the farthest away from the other workers what could possibly go wrong? I wish I never listened to her but hey, that's how my dumbass brain works sometimes I don't always realizing when something isn't right/suspicious and I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up ruining my life at some point because I actually have fallen for scams before. \n\nSince this happened I'm going to try my best to not be so gullible especially under pressure and in a busy environment I need to take a step back an evaluate situations first and really think about it but it just sucks I lost a decent paying job. I wish there was a supervisor watching me when this happened like they usually did but nope just my luck she wasn't there the one day I make a huge mistake. I take responsibility but at the same time I just wish it never happened I wish there were more jobs that were learning disability friendly and give you proper training and helpful supervisors this worries me that once I become an adult I'll make more mistakes by not being able to understand the directions, not working fast enough, or simply falling for things that aren't true so this experience tells me I don't need to work anywhere involving money again and if I had gave into pressure at the first job and agreed to the headset cashier position I probably would have messed up there too. They work you under pressure and tell you you're going too slow but when you listen to them and try to go at a faster pace and you mess up.\n\nAny one else fucked up so badly due to disability that it caused you to get fired?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 2325, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Making mistakes at work &amp; gullibility.

gave me was second grade reading sheets and basically is cut me in a shity room not doing nothing I'm not going to stay what you are graduate but it was a long time ago and they fucked up my education I'm not doing anything in my life right now and I feel like the system is against me my parents believe everything what the special ed teachers are saying about me but this was in the past I do have a job but I work in a sheet job making shity hours on all I ever got was an iep diploma they had  destroyed my life I have been taken the disabled bus almost 3 years now and they don't give a shit about us after we graduate I do have a social worker but the social worker is not doing shit for me she's not doing nothing for me at all or she's just doing just meeting me at Starbucks and signing some papers  I did post you back in 2017 but my account was deleted they had ruined my life parents parents parents please be careful what the special ed teachers I have to say about your child they are lying they just want to get more money and that's the problem the only care about the next paycheck believe it or not I'm still having problem learning I try go to a community college but they rejected me so that's show you how the system is against disabled people they ruined my life and now I'm paying the price for it it's like it's my fault because I have a disability and now I'm not doing nothing I work in a shity job just making shity hours and I don't have good money to get a good cell phone I have phone Samsung Galaxy S5 and I fucking hate it and I just saw my teacher at the mall my phone was special ed teacher I wanted to cuss her out she was driving a brand new Audi car and I saw her at the Apple Store but I didn't want to say anything because she might call the cops on me but really she had fucked up my life in special education all my life my and fucked up by the system and I'm not doing anything right now and I have no friends I hate my ADHD I hate my reading problem I hate everything about myself but they had ruined to my life they made my life miserable and they don't give a shit about me I saw my friend at the movie theaters we both agreed on the same issue he was in the same class as me they didn't teach us nothing but I felt like they just kept us in the room so we couldn't get away with other students and that's the problem if you don't have connections in the high school or in middle school then you are fucked by the system I have seen so many special ed students gets free pass if you don't have any family who works for the government then they treat you like shit there was a kid and a teacher they were fucking behind the school back and he's always texted her and now he works in a good job but anyway back what I'm saying about special ed I live in a poor neighborhood and I grew up with a poor family you don't know how much special education ruined my life im mean it this time they had fucked my education so many time and teachers were making shit up about me is not even true social workers they change so many show social workers this is the 30 social worker that they gave me and my opinion they have a discrimination against disabled people thank you very  he fucking left me when I  kid I fucking miss him so much my life is shit I have no girlfriend  I have nothing  my mom don't have a shit me everytime I try  to

"score": 1, "selftext": "Hello everyone, \n\nI purposely created reddit to get some insight on my current situation and to perhaps have some clarity on what is truly going on and what is really bothering me.\n\nSince I\u2019m in a very depressive episode it is almost impossible for me to remain positive and to find happiness in any aspect, especially when I\u2019m around people I feel so disconnected and I can\u2019t even maintain valuable conversations with them only because this is overpowering my entire life in general.\n\nDue to my depressive episode I decided to do some more research on my history and what has occurred during that era and I\u2019ve found a document that had very sensitive information about my childhood and more issues that I rather do not tackle on.\n\nBut most importantly it also explained a lot about my physical being and the way I function in daily life but just to remind you I was only 6 years old at the time.\n\nOne thing that really resonated with me is the fact that it said that I was \u201cweak minded\u201d and far behind other individuals when it\u2019s regarding development and it also had several estimations including my IQ which declared that I possess of an IQ of 68 which practically means \u201cmentally disabled\u201d and ever since I\u2019ve been reading this I could focus on anything else and I\u2019m really starting to believe those narratives that were written in that particular document.\n\nIn addition of that the tests were executed when my parents were going through a chaotic divorce that has traumatized me drastically and besides that I was also born prematurely with a small case of cerebral hemorrhage so it\u2019s commonly known that I process some information more slowly in comparison with other individuals but most importantly they\u2019ve transferred me to several special ed facilities about two times but eventually I was permitted to go to a regular school during my middle school era. \n\nEverything went well so far and I did catch up quickly in some departments like reading and writing despite the fact that I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to read and write in special education schools since they didn\u2019t really care about anything and only gave us small simplistic assignments.\n\nAnd comically enough English became one of my favorite subjects but I easily retained it due to the fact that my mother is from Ghanaian descent so I basically was emerged into the English language because of the many conversations my relatives were having and that I was watching many English movies.\n\nWouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s at Cambridge level but surprisingly enough I\u2019m more effective in English when I\u2019m comparing it with my native language (Dutch).\n\nAfter I graduated middle school (or high school it\u2019s a bit different in our country) I managed into an MBO school (it\u2019s after middle school or high school but it\u2019s not an uni but still at a higher level) finished my courses as a secretary and afterwards I was pursuing a study as a sales associate on a higher level.\n\nEverything was going good so far but I\u2019m noticing that I\u2019m really starting to lose myself and certain assignments can get very overwhelming when they require much attention and dedication but I always tried to do my best and so far I managed to pass the second semester.\n\nBut I informed my teachers about my \u201cburn out and depression complications\u201d and they are very understanding and considerate towards me but I personally think it\u2019s more than a burn out.. \n\nAt certain days I\u2019m undeniably productive and attentive but usually I\u2019m constantly laying in my bed trying to distract this consistent war in my mind.. but at particular times I can do things that require intelligence like writing blogs and writing songs but I\u2019m also losing the \u201cability\u201d to pursue with those activities. \n\nNow I\u2019m really relying on those documents and I wish that I never discovered them in the first place because I know that I\u2019m underestimating myself but I\u2019m secretly also quite frightened about my future.\n\nAnd over the months I\u2019ve became so socially awkward and imbecilic I just prevent any sort of interaction because I know it\u2019s going to destroy me from the inside.\n\nAs I confessed before I\u2019m really starting to believe that these \u201cassumptions\u201d or let\u2019s say these summarizations are true and that I will not excel academically and that I might be slightly mentally damaged after all..\n\nWhat should I do guys? Try to find for answers and investigate even more or perhaps attempt to do those IQ tests over again?\n\nMy friends are recommending to avoid the IQ test at the moment due to my depressive thoughts and my horrible case of anxiety, But I just want to know what is happening with me so I\u2019m aware of my \u201ccondition\u201d or my \u201cdisabilities\u201d that I can continue on with my life without the humiliating feeling of being \u201cdumb\u201d or \u201cdependent\u201d \n\nNo assured if people will eventually reply to this but I\u2019m thankful regardless. \n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to bring more enlightenment on the situation.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1465,

I think everyone is because mostly people only know the answers but never actually KNOW it. I want to know. Example on what I mean: You can follow a recipe and get the right outcome but without it you might not understand why certain things work. One day you might be a short an egg and won't have a clue what to use instead. They never learned why the ingredients worked together but only, \"if I follow the recipe exactly I'll be fine\". Never, \"the egg acts to make it more light and have moisture, bananas may be a worthy substitute.\" This burdens a lot of people because they don't have REAL knowledge.

Last time i can remember reading a book completely and understanding it, I was in the 6th grade.\n\nI had issues also with sounding out words and still have that issue. My mother took me to a tutor and the tutor would try to help me sound things out- and wouldn't help me and would stay silent until I got it right. We would usually sit there in complete silence for a while. But I really don't know what letters make what sound when trying to spell like that.\n\nIn 7th grade, the class was assigned a book to read, and while i was trying to read it, i had been stuck on one page and couldn't get past it- and all of a sudden, the words started moving on the page- like floating and mixing together. I took a reading test, and my result was a reading level of about 1050, which was surprising to my family and my teachers as they believed i had dyslexia or other reading issues. But when the words moved around- the letters didn't separate they just overlapped other words and wouldn't stay still. I never got a test to see if I actually had dyslexia but I think I would know.\n\nAround 9th grade, my school decided to put me into special ed, i didn't really understand why exactly- maybe because of my anxiety or my issues with math and English/reading. But it was really easy and I felt like I was going to slow and ahead of my classmates- but in normal classes, i couldn't keep up. Even in my special ed, I couldn't read anything but was introduced to audio books. I don't consider that reading though because I never looked at the words on the page.\n\nIn 10th grade, I started to notice that I couldn't focus on directions in class anymore. Which was very difficult for me in science and history. My mom said that was probably because things were getting harder each year but I felt like a complete idiot. Who couldn't read books, textbooks, or simple directions?\n\nBut I was writing very well and my special ed teacher noticed that I was doing way better than any of his students when it came to essays and creative writing. So that left me confused again, how can I write so good if I cant even read..\n\nHowever, I realized that I could read fanfics that my friends would write with no problem- but yet again, when I would play games like animal crossing, it would take me a long time to read the dialogue bubble thing- which I actually caught on video. My mother told me that the problem was probably that I just didn't have any interest in things that weren't fun- but even when I was playing games I was struggling so that couldn't be it- i hope.\n\nAnd that made me feel like I was pretending to have an issue. But every time I tried to do book-work or just read a published book for fun, I couldn't read a singe word or understand one sentence.\n\nI started to think again- maybe I do have dyslexia... I did (though rarely) write some numbers backwards and my issues with pronouncing words and spelling them out was something that gave me concern. I just am getting no answers about this problem and I am truly struggling with school.\n\nI have brought this up to my mother many times, and she immediately just says its not dyslexia and she believes that I do it just because...\n\nI just need to see if this is my fault or an actual problem..", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1407, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I've been struggling to read..", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/gzj6vy/ive_been_struggling_to_read/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "wls": 7}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "matrix_rain", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_69q3t00e", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1591493932, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/gy3hza/stemathon_survey/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gy3hza", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/gy3hza/stemathon_survey/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "C-7zZNge30cScyYIzaTpAFI7ptKFPXl8iOPNw9Famyg", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZiJVhtPOF2Y7-M2_COZ-5zOB8cTxLhAnOX6380qg9O8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12055dba3940821599f3963214cfc36f32fdef4", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZiJVhtPOF2Y7-M2_COZ-5zOB8cTxLhAnOX6380qg9O8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7da2730c32a248e67777c62899de2a051186ed0", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZiJVhtPOF2Y7-M2_COZ-5zOB8cTxLhAnOX6380qg9O8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f759839914f55792ff4120031a1f061f45c5368", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZiJVhtPOF2Y7-M2_COZ-5zOB8cTxLhAnOX6380qg9O8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8995be68b927c3821552ea3e20315ff5a2cc5bae", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZiJVhtPOF2Y7-M2_COZ-5zOB8cTxLhAnOX6380qg9O8.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8210cd40907070514476992351f277a0fb3ac85d", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZiJVhtPOF2Y7-M2_COZ-5zOB8cTxLhAnOX6380qg9O8.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d181ac4c904abb3415554a550b48c4389f2e4d3", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZiJVhtPOF2Y7-M2_COZ-5zOB8cTxLhAnOX6380qg9O8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1551e3e0318c3fcbe4767698a2a34fc34a7b63f1", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 7, "retrieved_on": 1591493933, "score": 1, "selftext": " Hello!

I'm 27 years old and I'm currently enrolled at an online university to get my degree, but I've been finding that the same struggles I had in school have been coming back, and it really hit me that I may have something when I experienced some relief after starting a new anxiety medication. (I only notice relief if I increase my meds before working on my class work, but it's only helps with the panic, not the struggle.) I'm wondering if anyone has an idea.\n\nMy biggest struggle is that I have a really hard time understanding directions and it always seems like everyone else around me has received different instructions. I don't have a problem with reading or writing, in fact those are my strong suits, but if something is implied, I have to write it out in a long way to break it down for myself (and often this doesn't work because I'm so lost).\n\nWhen I was 13 and learning algebra for the first time, I may have had a panic attack and had a big fight with my mom multiple times just trying to understand y=mx+b. It didn't make sense how everyone else figured out what the slope was when it just said something like 4. Like, 4 *what*? I finally figured it out that I had to always convert it to a fraction (4/1) for my brain to make sense of it, and if I forgot I'd start getting really anxious and would stress myself until I was crying, if I hadn't already given up. (I mostly just gave up in class, and cried over homework. Needless to say, I still mostly hate algebra because I remember what it was like.) After that, I just made a point to do what I could and give up if something got too hard, because it was just *that much harder*. (I now realize my anxiety and depression was not helping and was making it worse.)\n\nIn my day-to-day life I still have to break things down for myself when I'm learning, but getting others to break things down enough for it to make sense is nearly impossible because it seems everyone else just understands. I've tried asking teachers for help and there have been times where they will straight up ask me \"Why don't you get it? No one else has a problem!\". I've asked for other resources for the same material, like if they could recommend a book, and it's been equally unhelpful because they want to explain it to me, instead of give me a better resource, which then always comes back to them explaining it in a way that I don't understand and I spend even more time trying to break what they said down so I can understand, and it's never what I need.\n\nI've been told that I'm very literal in how I communicate, and I need direct orders to make sense of things. (I know this is a thing for people with autism, but I'm fairly confident I don't have that since I have never had a problem with sarcasm, which I'm told is a tell. Although one of my parents may have had un-diagnosed autism.) This adds to the struggle with school because I can't always figure out where to even go for an assignment or figure out what I'm supposed to be reading.\n\nI also have some issues with understanding and remembering things that are spoken. If they are written down it sticks in my head, so I usually have to compensate by writing stuff down at work (lists are my life!). God forbid my teachers only give me a video to listen to with no transcript that's at all hard to understand, or is too fast or slow.\n\nDoes this sound like a learning disability, or something else?\n\nI appreciate your time! :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1384, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Learning Disability?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/gqhk6i/learning_disability/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "wls": 7}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "halfassgoogled", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6j59t5cc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1590261327, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/gpaqu0/what_are_your_challenges_if_you_know_two/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gpaqu0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/gpaqu0/what_are_your_challenges_if_you_know_two/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 7, "retrieved_on": 1590261333, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1382, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What are your challenges if you know two languages or more, and what are the methods of overcoming them?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/gpaqu0/what_are_your_challenges_if_you_know_two/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "wls": 7}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Throwawayjian14", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6jw2f1fy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1590232442, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/gp369g/how_to_get_tested_in_canada/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gp369g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/gp369g/how_to_get_tested_in_canada/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 7, "retrieved_on": 1590232443, "score": 1, "selftext": "Since I started my career in communications and marketing 5 years ago, I\u2019ve struggled to meet expectations at work.

In the past five years of moving here I have been in the d2L program in jr high school. It is supposed to help people through school with learning disabilities but during those few years in the d2l program that I wasn\u2019t accommodated enough. For math we wouldn\u2019t learn what the normal kids were learning we were learning stuff that was dumbed down which doesn\u2019t feel right to me because I thought this program was going to help me through junior high and help me learn. In ninth grade my math teacher refused to teach me I would have to do other booklets and I tried so hard to do the normal math and  i got it for the most part but every time i got something right my math teacher would just shut me down. My math teacher was very unprofessional she would talk about my learning struggles at home to her son went to the school and I got ridiculed throughout my grade nine year  for not being able to do grade level math. So in my opinion having the d2l program did not help at all so grade 10 starts and I get put into the dash four class and one English class that is dash one but i failed that because I didn\u2019t get support but i almost did pass it, i was at a 49 my teacher could have bumped up my grade but he didn\u2019t. But now being on grade 11 I have to graduate next year but I don\u2019t have enough time to get my high school diploma and I will have to graduate with a knowledge and employment certificate and i just feel like such a failure to everyone around me i try my hardest when im at school but it just never pays off but i\u2019m going to have to stay an extra two years to finish English social and math and science it\u2019s just very upsetting for me because I just wanna be normal and having dyslexia dyspraxia is really hard for me because schools is hard even though I give it my all I just wish the Calgary school board would help me and give me more opportunities to show that I can do this higher level classes I just feel like the school board is giving up on me and that I\u2019m a lost cause it\u2019s just so hard and I\u2019m so stressed all the time but other then that thats about it sorry for ranting on here lol if you guys have any advice for me that would be great", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "the cbe setting you up for failure", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/gg7atk/the_cbe_setting_you_up_for_failure/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "FabulousTrade", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_65s2fvfy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1588964367, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/gfz7qi/dyscalculiaapd_in_the_retailservice_industry/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gfz7qi", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/gfz7qi/dyscalculiaapd_in_the_retailservice_industry/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1588964371, "score": 1, "selftext": " I (38f) was diagnosed with dyscalculia and APD at around 8 years old. Ever since I turned 18, I sought out fast food places, restaurants, and retail, but would be quickly disqualified because I failed the math test (this was in the late 1990s/2000s) or I made the mistake of mentioning my APD, so my job options were limited. I didn't get my first job until I was 28.\n\nI did pretty well for a while, working jobs where there would be very little math work while receiving disability checks. Those checks stopped when I had to move to another state, but reapplying became a headache because my application would be rejected despite having documentation of my dyscalculia and APD. My work delayed more due to the same limited opportunities. I can't use friends because I've struggled to keep them on account of my processing being mistaken for rudeness.\n\nNow I am living with my parents in their tourist city where 90% of the jobs are retail/service/fast food. I tried 2 vocational services but after 2 years of nothing, I left them both.

Great! We want to help you understand how the Australian Standards for Playgrounds can really help you achieve a great result.\n\nIt may help you to know we firmly believe the current Australian Standards are the best they have ever been. Yes, the best for everybody but especially the children that need great opportunities to play. And we say that as having 30 years of experience in building playgrounds.\n\nYou see, Australia went through a period in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s when many of the old playgrounds were shut down due to safety issues (many of them rightly so) but the new standards that were implemented at the time led to what we now call the \u201ccotton wool kids\u201d era. When everything had to be so safe it largely lost the spirit of play.\n\nPlaygrounds became very \u201ccookie cutter\u201d style to maintain the safety, a lot of the height factor was taken away, even \u201cforeseeable risk\u201d (which is a good thing by the way) had to be designed out of the playgrounds and, well, kids and their parents just lost interest in going to the playground. And we could understand why. The thrill had gone, you might say.\n\n### [The good news? Actually the great news is\u2026 there were (and still are) enough concerned individuals in the world that recognised the need of exciting, challenging and stimulating play as an essential part of a child\u2019s growing up years and they could see that the benefit of this was being lost because of these onerous safety standards.](https://www.moduplay.com.au/)\n\nAs a result since around 2000 they (and we) have been steadily working with the Safety Standards organisations and Government bodies, in Australia and around the world, to remove the shackles from playground designers and re-introduce the elements of risk that are OK to have in a playground. And to also write these rules into the standards so designers have the tolerance of design to make playgrounds attractive to children once again.\n\nAn example of how the authors of the Australian Standards managed to do this is by making it easy (through clear definitions, dimensions and diagrams) for designers, manufacturers and playground auditors to identify the difference between a **\u201cforeseeable risk\u201d** and a **\u201chazard\u201d**.\n\n### A \u201cforeseeable risk\u201d\n\nIs where a child can see there is risk involved but they build confidence by trying to master the challenge it represents (eg: a sway bridge with sides that are relatively open design)\n\n### A \u201chazard\u201d \n\nIs something that may injure a child that they could not pre-identify as dangerous (eg: sharp edges or spaces where they may get trapped).\n\nSo you can see the practical benefit of having rules to assist with good playground design. This is where they shine and is why you can have confidence they are not just \u201cmore red tape\u201d but actually add value to the modern day process of designing new play spaces.\n\nAs a playground operator, you should engage with a professional or competent playground designer that can interpret the standards for you, to make the process easy and ensure a reliable outcome.\n\nFor more information on the management or safety guidelines relating to public playgrounds, give our friendly and experienced staff a call today on [**(02) 4272 1644**](https://www.moduplay.com.au/contact/)**.** \n\n Source URL: [https://www.moduplay.com.au/playground-safety-standards-are-they-realistic-or-necessary/](https://www.moduplay.com.au/playground-safety-standards-are-they-realistic-or-necessary/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1328, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Playground Safety Standards \u2013 are they realistic, or even necessary, and how will they help me get a better result with our new playground?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/g5xbw4/playground_safety_standards_are_they_realistic_or/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Kaylah365", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_25hye6gd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1587400286, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/g4w0wh/what_could_this_be/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g4w0wh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/g4w0wh/what_could_this_be/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1587400291, "score": 1, "selftext": "\u2022I have trouble articulating myself alot (example being I had to make a call to my pharmacy one time and I had to write down what I wanted to say) (Most of the time, I have to write what I want to say or else I won't be able to articulate myself; though I do better with writing)\n\n\u2022I have a terrible short term memory where I'll forget whole conversations (an example of this is where I had therapy online a few days ago and when my therapist asked what I got out of it, I couldn't tell her because I forgot most of the conversation)\n\n\u2022Sometimes, it's hard to understand others and when I do, I forget what they say\n\n\u2022Odd thing is I really didn't start noticing these problems until last year.

I didn\u2019t learn to read until the third grade, then struggled to commit my thoughts to paper, then struggled with math in middle school. By the time i was in high school I had essentially given up. It was diagnosed a number of times throughout my childhood but none of the treatments seemed to stick. \n\nAs I have gotten older (30/m) I have worked through those issues, rerolled in college and have mostly excelled. Now that I am in the transition from the community college level to the university level these hurdles seem to be starting to re-emerge. \n\nIt\u2019s not exactly that I expected pursuing a math intensive degree (economics) to be easy for me but it constantly seems like I am hitting walls that seem insurmountable. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t have any trouble implementing the core ideas of calculus in my approach to solving higher level problems. \n\nIn the past I have struggled with the introduction of a new concept for an inordinate amount of time and the made huge leaps in my understanding of the subject (i.e. went from being illiterate at the beginning of 3rd grade to having a 9th grade reading level at start of the 4th). Now things seem different, it seems like I am\nquickly losing the progress I have made in higher math, calculus went smoothly but now I am struggling with algebra as it applies to proofs. \n\nHas anyone had a similar issue in their ability to navigate life as an adult with a learning disability as well as a strong desire to understand complicated and rigorous subjects? \n\nThe degree I am pursuing in economics is something I do online for personal fulfillment after my real job as a carpenter.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1311, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Overcoming adversity in learning disabilities", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/g0d105/overcoming_adversity_in_learning_disabilities/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Ltrimarchi1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_58bvrqus", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1586712636, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/g00xaw/research_study_opportunity_chance_to_win_50/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g00xaw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/g00xaw/research_study_opportunity_chance_to_win_50/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "aozs3vDdxRjYCAycwVYXdT_j7oKpuVf8pO1HGm3tIWk", "resolutions": [{"height": 139, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/ryinjk5f9fs41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32a247e16a7f11cc55fec4bf6e02fee4d7e4eaa4", "width": 108}, {"height": 279, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/ryinjk5f9fs41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=673288467a96acae95a92a3b0000d2a59e039f93", "width": 216}, {"height": 414, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/ryinjk5f9fs41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1014724328d75a9476d439706ccdc5910aaa4cf7", "width": 320}, {"height": 828, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/ryinjk5f9fs41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ae3e103c2c617c85614ec1368380031a2661cb8", "width": 640}, {"height": 1242, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/ryinjk5f9fs41.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00cef2254c284e29d0a2931ec026ac582717f135", "width": 960}, {"height": 1397, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/ryinjk5f9fs41.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fdd6a42b7aa6f648d66ce4724b6a0bec6b6c150", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 1650, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/ryinjk5f9fs41.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=093e53c85d8c1cff405f4ac01e9b0b6a32e795bf", "width": 1275}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1586746985, "score": 2, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1310, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/IIjRGgVjp48K7jQyvlnNZV0cItrcbjVDWOrZT83xVtw.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Research study opportunity: Chance to win $50 Amazon gift card", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://i.redd.it/ryinjk5f9fs41.jpg"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "spectacularkay", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ar0ak5x", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1586571049, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/fyuc0q/could_i_have_a_learning_disability/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fyuc0q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/fyuc0q/could_i_have_a_learning_disability/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1586571052, "score": 1, "selftext": "I know you guys can't diagnose me, but im hoping this means something and can potentially lead me to getting a formal diagnosis.

I couldn't really pinpoint what it might be but I tried asking him about it. He got really offended and said that he doesn't have a learning disability. I tried telling him that it is not a problem or anything but if we knew more information we can come up with better ways to help him study for his classes, because he is having difficulty. The other day when I was shredding old papers for him I saw a letter from when he was in jr hs addressed to his parents about him requiring individualized program due to a learning disability (letter was vague didnt provide too many details). I did not bring it up to him to avoid him getting upset but it kind of confirmed my suspicion.\n\nThese are the things I've noticed:\n- trouble reading and spelling even really simple words?

My son is 5 and supposed to be starting kindergarten this fall. My wife and I have been trying to teach him the alphabet, numbers, how to spell his name, etc. We got ABC mouse and he plays the games just fine. We got magnet numbers and letters and every day we practice his name and random words he wants to spell. He can match letters and numbers, says them out loud along with the games, traces along with printouts or whatever. He can recite his alphabet with ease, and can count to 20 (keeps skipping 14, but otherwise he's got it). Even does simple addition on his fingers. He's a super bright kid if you talk to him.\n\nBut something isn't sticking right. He consistently scrambles the letters in his name, can't seem to recall half the alphabet or numbers when you point to them, and even when looking at a number or letter he can't replicate it freehand. Most current example, the number 5. He can trace it just fine, starts in the top right and goes from there. But when he starts freehanding it, he starts in the top left and just loses it, starts making wildly obscure shapes that don't resemble anything, let alone a five. We've tried showing/telling him to start in the top right, but it's not sinking in. We go along with him, like we draw a line from right to left and he still goes left to right. I understand he could go left to right if he lifts the pencil and goes back to the left, but he doesn't get that either. \n\nWe are absolutely at our wits end. I am becoming increasingly convinced there is a deeper underlying issue here that I don't know how to address. I don't know if this is a learning disability, and I don't know where to go to even test for that kind of thing. I myself have ADD, which I understand is probably on the lighter side of possible issues, but I mean at least I can understand that learning can be hard. I just don't understand why it would be THIS hard. I want to help , but I'm desperately underprepared for this.\n\nPlease, I have no idea what to do or who to talk to. If there is a serious issue here, I'm more than willing to do whatever it takes to try and help him through this. I just want to be a good Dad and I feel like I'm failing him.

\nMy boyfriend works at a coding for kids place run by an asian couple. \n(a back story: My boyfriend has depression,anxiety, he is considered high functioning autism, and he is dyslexic. but I love him to pieces because he is such a genuine, sweet, caring guy.) \n\n(back story to the situation)\nHe was asked to make lesson plans and he was very passionate about it and honestly the kids he was teaching them to loved it. \nThey retained all the information, was able to create games and websites. \nAt first his employer said they would pay him for the lessons he made per hour. \nHe accumulated 40 hours. \nHe sent his employer the hours and they said they couldnt pay him (I was livid). but the next day they say they will pay him for less than half the hours with a +$1 promotion. (w.e we took it anyways) \n\nBUT they asked him to STOP making lessons and so the employer makes it herself now but its black and white slides and it's boring. \n\nBtw we couldnt call BBB because we figured they couldnt do anything because this was all said by mouth and there was no written contract or any written documentation to prove he was right in anyway. But my boyfriend learned his lesson. \n\n(Here is how the situation)\nThere is a student at this coding place and his family is aware he has some learning disabilities. It is very prevalent when you sit down and work with him. They also have spoke with my boyfriend about what his issues were and how he does in school. \n\nDue to my bf now unable to make his lesson plans the employer makes slides that are boring, with tables,  very small fonts (I swear I looked at it it's like size 8 font) and WRONG CODING LINES that dont even work. \n\nThis poor child sat through two classes already cried, hides underneath the table becuase he can not focus, is bored, lost, confused,scared (told my bf himself), puts himself down (calls himself stupid, cant do anything right, etc.) and had a hard time retaining the classes information. \n(he isnt the only child there that is having a hard time retaining with these new lesson plans) \n\nThis employer says that she didnt know he had a learning disability (like for real you OWN this business you ACCEPT these students to come learn coding at YOUR facility. She has TAUGHT CLASSES with this child also in her class in the past and she DIDNT KNOW?????) Anyways my boyfriend told me that her solution to solve this issue was all she said was to have him removed from the classes because he can't do these new coding lines.\n\nLIKE WHAT SHES SHUTTING DOWN A CHILDS INTREST OR EVEN FUTURE CAREER??!!\n I promise u this child has successfully made a simple website and simple games just like the other students in the class. \n\nCLEARLY he was doing just fine when he was learning off of my boyfriends lesson plans and slides. \n\nIt breaks my heart to hear this is happening because my boyfriend told me he sees himself in this kid struggling learning new things with just shit lessons. \n\nI have worked in the past with disabled children (I'm a toddler and preschool teacher so I experienced and help parents through when their children are being diagnosed at a young age) and in disability homes with elders, adults, teens and young children. This is always a touchy subject to me so hearing another older adult say this to a disabled child really puts me through the roof. \n\n(if you are interest here is what the employer does when my bf teaches.)\nbefore the whole \"pay me for my lessons plans\" situation she never came in at all to help my boyfriend teach his classes. \n\nNOW\n\nShe sits on the side in her \"boss desk\" and watches my bf teach these kids with her slids, with the WRONG INFORMATION ON IT and barely helps the kids. \nShe watches aslo him have to  rewrite code lines that actually on the board and he cant even EDIT THE SLIDES OF WRONG CODE LINES.

She worked this job for about 6 months out of the year for 2 years and I think her role consisted of things like dish washing, cleaning, and maybe being a hostess. She has speech difficulties (maybe verbal apraxia?) and I really have to listen closely to understand her. She seems to have the maturity of a middle schooler as far as her interests, reading level, and life skills go. Her writing skills are extremely poor, lacking basic elementary school grammar, spelling, and syntax. When my husband (her brother) and I try helping her with things she writes for an online class she's taking, she can't spot even the most blatant errors and doesn't understand why we've circled something on her paper to change (ex: \"He say it to me\" vs \"He said it to me\"). This makes me think she also has dyslexia, but I'm pretty ignorant on stuff like that. She receives disability checks and was encouraged to apply for those benefits in the first place by her parents, so they can take advantage of the extra money too, which has enraged my husband. She doesn't know how much is in her bank account and doesn't know how to find that out and doesn't really see the importance of asking for help about that. \n\nMy husband doesn't think she has any disabilities and believes she can do anything she puts her mind to and become whatever she wants to be. I think this is a great attitude to have and I completely support her to follow her dreams (which is to be a floral designer! Love it!), but I can't help but think we're giving her unrealistic expectations. Her parents, on the other hand, completely discourage her from trying anything new. They didn't want her to take online classes and they'd rather see her work at Walmart for the rest of her life because they don't think she's capable of doing much else. It's really frustrating and heart breaking to see her living with that kind of negativity from her own parents. My husband and I continually encourage her and challenge her, but is this all in vain? My husband is in total denial that she has any kind of disability, and I'm just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation. I don't know whether to continue helping her with her class papers or just letting her submit them as-is so she can understand that she needs a tutor or something when she receives a poor grade. I just don't know what the best way is to help her and I feel like I'm the only one who recognizes that she has a disability but also understands that she isn't completely helpless. I don't know what the right balance is. I really hope I didn't sound mean, I've just never been in this situation before and I want to her to succeed as much as she can because I love her so much!\n\nThank you in advance for any advice/insights you might have!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1185, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Need advice on helping an adult sibling-in-law with learning disabilities", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/eztou1/need_advice_on_helping_an_adult_siblinginlaw_with/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Labbehanz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kkyhys5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1580918465, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/ezbnkg/what_are_the_downsides_of_having_dysgraphia_does/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ezbnkg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/ezbnkg/what_are_the_downsides_of_having_dysgraphia_does/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1580918469, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1182, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What are the downsides of having dysgraphia?

And to add insult to injury, before the new information can even make it to the bouncer at the front door, my attention span (which is supposed to be in charge of managing the traffic and parking lots to the club) keeps losing interest in everything and winds up directing all of the potential information (even VIP information that I personally want to come to my club) away from the premises.\n\nI can read paragraphs numerous times and sometimes even listen to them,  and they just never settle in.

I work at Wal-Mart. Part time. For five years. And I work in Fashion and pretty much have just always done what I'm good at. Which is clean. I am responsible for making sure Fashion is tidy. That the tables are always folded. That the returns are always put away (sometimes I show up to 1 or 2 carts piled high with returns)I have to keep everything off the floor, just keep Fashion looking nice, everything in the right place, etc.\n\nI was hired as a Cashier here but just like my first job as a teen I got fired from, Cash was way to complicated for me and I got moved. I will say though I eventually took the time to learn how to cover the smaller areas of the store, electronics and cosmetics but that's mostly because everyone pays with debit. Cash payments still take me by surprise and make me struggle, I'm horrid at counting change and any unexpected things confuses me and throws me off.\n\nI recently tried to apply for full time sales floor. My mom has been putting understanding pressure on me to get full time work. \"You are 28! You can't live on part time forever or live at home forever\" my mom tells me. I know she's right, so I tried, and I allowed myself to be hopeful. Sales floor full time had the same description as sales floor part time. Basically it sounded like my job would be what I do now in Fashion but likely all over the store, zoning (putting everything in place) putting away returns, keeping the store clean. I was scared at the idea of working longer hours but hopeful I'd be making a step forward in my life.\n\nBut right in the interview, they pretty much said no, you are not qualified. They were nice about it. Every worker who applies is entitled to an interview so it started with them asking me the standard questions. They seemed to like my answers - especially when I told them the reason they should hire me over others is I don't plan to leave - they loved that one. They told me I had an amazing attidude, BUT...\n\nWell, the position was just... I mean, I'm not suited to it. I'd need to be able to do Front End, and whether I can do that is just a 'maybe' Sales floor full time is also not the same job as sales floor part time. They would want the person chosen to be a assistant and also a leader. \"Would you be able to lead meetings?\" They asked me. \"Give associates orders?\" I weakly replied yes, or \"I'd try\" when deep down my mind was screaming NO I CANNOT I AM NOT A LEADER I am a FOLLOWER I do not FEEL comfortable with the idea of LEADING!!\"\n\nThey were so kind, but I could tell they didn't believe me. They even said once again, 'it was all just maybes' they didn't think I could do it, and I didn't either tbh,\n\nBut here's the thing. They told me they were going to make a development plan for me. I'd be taught new things, train on front end, and if I worked on it, full time would for sure be in my future one day. They told me they liked my attidude, my response about not leaving (we don't want you to leave!) They told me one day the person chosen for this position might get promoted and then it would be opened to me again.\n\nI should be flattered right? And happy? I acted like it. But inside, I was spiralling.\n\nMy mom has been putting such pressure on me for full time. And I didn't get full time. And the honest truth is, I may never. I have such learning difficulties I don't know if I'll ever be capable of front end cash. I don't WANT to be. Suddenly I was missing our old Manager. The one who was here when I started. He saw how much I was struggling being trained on the Front end and he pulled me out and into the office and told me he was moving me to Fashion, because he did NOT WANT me to show up to work anxious everyday which I had been since I started. He didn't think I should work like that. He understood.\n\nI also can't picture myself a leader, giving orders, leading meetings (public speaking gets me tongue tied and I can't speak properly) Even if I learn new skills (they will be training me to learn new tasks in the Fashion department) I can't picture ever being qualified to the degree they'd want for full time.\n\nSo what do I do, I wonder? How am I going to tell my mom? I know what she'd say. You need to look for another job.\n\nSo for the last few days I've been looking for jobs. There are part time ones...  and I suppose I could get a second part time job. But I feel anxious picturing how that would work. My work likes that I can work anytime. I'd have to change my availability and at any place I applied too I'd have to pick certain days I can work since I wouldn't be available for them all the time either. But also, minimum wage is 14 in Canada but I'm at 16 an hour now from little increases every year at Walmart. And our Manager is really good at giving you extra hours if you text him and ask (I just have to be less lazy and ask more) so is a second part time job really worth it?\n\nI tried looking for full time, but there really isn't much that isn't for Managers or Leaders. I found a few for associates and I should try and apply but as always, job descriptions make me spiral. Things like \"Must be a fast learner\" give me anxiety because I am a slow learner. Everything sounds so hard in the descriptions. I grow fearful. Walmart may not give me full time, but they are pretty chill. Most of my shifts are pretty relaxed, just me cleaning and tidying Fashion and folding and hanging clothes and putting returns away. If you want to learn more, they expect you to take initiative but won't force you.. I realize now for five years I've never taken initiative to learn more because the few times I tried it was to confusing and it's just easier to stay in my comfort zone, where I can do what I'm good at. \n\nBut other jobs, I know, wouldn't be like that. The descriptions tell me I'd be in for a real wake up call in these jobs, they would expect so much more and I'm terrified. I know me. I'm bad at most things. Slow comprehension. People can get frustrated quick. There's a woman I hate working with if I get morning shifts as the Morning staff have stocking duties and pricing duties and basically run the Fashion Department (I just clean it) and if you work with them they WILL try and give you things to do. And I've never been good at their tasks. This woman gets so annoyed with me, I have trouble comprehending her instructions and she gets impatient and swoops in correcting every little thing she doesn't like until she tells me to just go do something else and let her do it. Story of my life, I've been hearing \"Let me just do it\" all my life, which is why I DON'T try and learn new skills too. I'm never good at even the most mundane complicated things.\n\nI like just cleaning Fashion. I can fold. I can hang clothes. I can pick things off the floor. I can empty return carts and put clothes away. Leave me in peace basically.\n\nBut other jobs aren't going to let me have it so easy. Job descriptions scare me to no end. I always find things that scare me. Even if I like the idea of the job at first I panic. For example, I saw an opening for Hot Topic once. I was like oh I like Hot Topic! But then I thought about how TINY the store is. It's inside a mall and it's SO tiny.. the store is kind of claustrophobic. It's one of those tiny stores in a mall where there's little places to move. There would be NOWHERE to hide.\n\nI like how Walmart is big and my department is huge. I enjoy walking around my department, surveying my domain basically, having the freedom of movement. Hot Topic is like a tiny cave. And I thought, I've come in many times to just ONE WORKER in the entire store. Would I be left ALONE sometimes? I feel panic fill me. I need people to be able to rescue me. The idea of being alone in there... oh my god. And also the job wants you selling and promoting and ohmygod I can't do that. I am to shy and anxious to promote things. Hell, I wouldn't even remember the lines I'm supposed to give because under nerves I can't repeat promotion lines.\n\nI feel so pathetic. Like a loser. My learning difficulties have NEVER made me want to try harder. I've always just wanted to shy away from things that are hard for me. I think to myself, with how slow I am, if I did get hired full time at new job I'd probably be let go for not being good enough. I'm still not over how I got fired in my first job. I'm still not over all the times in my life people have been mean to be from impatience because of how I struggle with things. I don't want to put myself in positions where I'll be set up to fail.\n\nWhy can't I just work full time somewhere retail and just do what I do now? You can't tell me big stores like Walmart couldn't use full time people who just tidy and clean and put away returns. The part timers don't have enough hours to keep up with it!\n\nAnyway I'm just scared. I'm 28. 2 years, I'm 30. I don't feel 28. I don't feel almost 30. I still feel 16. I was looking through my 16 year old diary. And all the problems I had then are so similar. 16 year old me was terrified about doing her volunteer hours. 16 year old me wrote about how volunteering during the art show set up had one of the art teachers get super mad at me because I couldn't comprehend his instructions. And then he just told me to go off and he'd \"just do it\" which I realize is a huge theme of my life. \n\nPeople have been getting impatient with me all my life and then shoving me away, telling me 'I'll take over'. My mom has even done this all my life! People get impatient, give up on me and tell me they'll just do it for me, since I can't. And the truth is, I started finding this so comforting. I'm more than happy to hand off things I struggle with to people who KNOW what they are doing. A woman at work did this to me just the start of this month too, it's always happening, I can't comprehend instructions and people get so impatient they realize it's more efficient to do it themselves.\n\n16 year old me also talked about how she didn't want a job because she was scared of being bad at it. 16 year old me didn't picture a future for herself. She didn't know how she would ever move out, or how she'd ever be an adult. Well, I'm 28 years old and I never have moved out or figured anything out. There's been no development. That's why I mentally feel 16 years old, not almost 30.\n\nIt just hurts.\n\nI don't know what to do. I did go to College for Journalism, because my parents wanted me too, because they would pay. I graduated amazingly, but I hated every moment. I hated reporting. I like writing but creative writing. I just did what I had to do to pass but unlike the others in the program I wasn't excelling or passionate I was taking easy ways out, most of my articles were about on Campus events because I wanted easy things. I wanted the less stress. I just wanted to be done and escape. I was going through the motions to get passing grades.\n\nI like writing. Always dreamed of writing a book. But been to depressed to put my ideas into words. And anyway, what's the likelihood I'd write something and actually makes enough money to live off it?\n\nI feel so lost. So sad. When you're bad at everything what is your future? I've been thinking about during my interview my Manager told me they loved my positive attidude and never to lose it. I wondered later why he said that. I guess because they were basically nicely turning me down for full time and he didn't want it to crush me? He didn't want me to lose my positive outlook? Well the truth is, I am. I don't know how much longer I can act positive to the world.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1173, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm bad at everything.

English is not my first language, I started to speak and read at the age of 7. During my adolescence years my parents were immigrants to Australia and constantly worked their asses off while I was a lonesome who had no one to interact with but the T.V. During my childhood in primary school I kept on getting sent to special help due to my ability to comprehend to the language and pick up social clues. \n\nMy social development slightly got better after the age of 10 years old. High school was a bit of a challenge as I felt my understanding was some what behind the eight ball and felt like I was falling behind to my peers. \n\nThrough out my teenage years I always tried my best and gave my best in what I did but depression decided to set in and I kind of lost motivation to do anything. I failed horribly but still passed high school with the lowest grade as possible. \n\nA few months after high school I decided to rebuild my foundation and chose a field of Business studies which I thought was interesting. I managed to obtain my diploma with goods marks which gave me a open pathway to study a bachelors degree. The next few years were hell, I lost motivation and was suicidal to the point that my brain couldn't comprehend anything, I failed not once, not twice, not three times, but six times in total. I failed pretty much all of my 101 classes, the university had no choice but to suspend me. \n\nFast forward 4.5 years on I am working in a mundane job with no interest. I am just glazing into day and hope that night will come around as I can numb my feelings of emptiness away when I fall asleep. \n\nIf I have a certain interest it makes things slightly easier to comprehend but it can be a struggle at times. It takes me a few times to re-read something which caused me to have OCD which developed during my adolescence years. \n\nI don't know if I am mentally retarted, autistics or stupid. But I refuse to get diagnosed as I feel the label will be stuck with me. \n\nApologise for the rant.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1171, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I don't know if I have a disability or I am stupid.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/eulxzd/i_dont_know_if_i_have_a_disability_or_i_am_stupid/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "keyzz95", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_10elmt77", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1580095757, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/eui3pc/adhd_and_learning_disability_struggles/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eui3pc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/eui3pc/adhd_and_learning_disability_struggles/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1580095759, "score": 1, "selftext": "What will help with my leaving disability and hdhd.

We are communicating through zoom and using google jamboard and she has told me that she likes this setup because it is very visual and interactive. She is great and I really want her to succeed but I feel bad because I feel like I don\\`t have the right training for disabilities. I also don\\`t know what her particular disability is and though she has alluded to having a disability counselor, I don\\`t want to be rude and ask too much about it.  I sometimes feel that she is getting the individual steps, but I have trouble communicating the general concepts in a way that she can replicate it without guidance. \n\nMy approach is that I try to be visual with lots of arrows and using different colors for different things. (I use these techniques when teaching calculus too because I just think they\\`re helpful for anyone including myself.) I usually start the problem and then ask her to tell me what the next step is to try and get her to recognize the pattern. I try to reinforce anything correct that she says like if she says 2 and the answer is x squared, I would tell her that this really close and there is a 2 in it, then draw and x and ask her where it goes in front or up to the right. I also try to make sure there is no added stress from me and to never act disappointed or frustrated to her because I know she gets overwhelmed and sad which makes me feel really bad.\n\nAn example of something we have worked on before is foiling.  (Feel free to skip this next paragraph if you\\`re not comfortable with algebra, the main points have already been made.) Say we had something like:\n\n (x + 3)(x + 4). If I draw arrows from what we need to multiply together in each step she will tell me the correct result for that part most of the time with the exception of when negative numbers are involved. I try to explain the pattern but I can\\`t seem to explain it in a way that's graspable. If I use math terminology like saying something like \"multiply the first terms in each set of parentheses together first\", that doesn't seem to help. But if I totally avoid math jargon  and use general terms along with arrows it ends up sounding too vague and she stops paying attention if its too wordy of an explanation. Then she asks me to say it again and it turns into me just saying we need to multiply this and this straight out so that we can make progress. It also doesn\\`t help that there is a delay in Jamboard so my drawings may come up a bit after I say something. \n\nIf you have learning disabilities, what has helped you with learning math (or

I'm curious if the way I learn and the struggles I face with traditional teaching is some kind of learning disability. I don't believe it's anything more, I guess, 'severe'. I'm curious if there are folks that experience the same thing and perhaps if there is a name or term for it.\n\nI learn in reverse. The world makes sense to me in reverse. Not like Z-&gt;A, but end result -&gt; beginning point. Schools don't teach this way and I struggle to learn. \n\nI'm 44 now and when I was younger I was considered quite smart. I knew basic math including multiplication tables and division by the time I hit grade one. We worked out of workbooks and in my boredom, I finished my math workbook in an afternoon, learning as I went.\n\nIt was grade 4 when I was diagnosed with ADHD. This would have been 1984 I think and medical science wasn't exactly great back then. I was not medicated. They gave a sample of some kind of pill that's since been outlawed and it turned me into a zombie, so sayeth my mother. She didn't like what it turned me into. Hyper focused and despondent to outside stimulation.\n\nThere fundamental learning event for me that I recall clearly:\n\nMy mother showing me how to navigate a circular maze on the back of a Shreddies box. I kept running into dead ends and was having issues figuring out how to do it without trying every avenue and brute force. She showed me to work from the 'goal' and then work my way back to the start. This was very significant and clicked with me.\n\nSo this formed the basis of how I learned. I was exceptionally destructive but it was about taking the end product and deconstructing it to see all the parts to see how it ticked. It wasn't boredom or maliciousness, it was curiosity. I had the end result, I just needed to work it back to the individual parts. \n\nI'm a big picture kind of guy. INTP. I like probability. I like problem solving. I'm a 'fixer'. \n\nWhen it comes to learning new things at work or when I was in college, I find myself very frustrated. Every time I sit down and try to learn something, I end up with the same questions and just wonder how anyone learns anything with the way it's being taught. That brings me to the thought, 'it must be just me, then'.\n\nI just don't get it. You don't go over how to use a hammer, how to use a saw, how to use a protractor before you're told you're going to design and build a house. So every course for me, I have to compartmentalize everything I'm 'learning' and hope in the end they get to the point so I can then go back and relearn everything with \\*context\\*.\n\nSo, to combat this, I am forced to ask for context before we begin. Why are we learning this? What does it do? What does the end result look like? Why is this important for me?\n\nTeaching throughout my lifetime has always been the same. I sit for however long wondering why were learning this, why it's important, what it's supposed to do, what's the big picture and I get hung up on that until we're all done.\n\n\"This is pulp. These are seeds. You don't want the seeds. This is the rind. When you squeeze the pulp, you get juice. Here's how to do that. Any questions?\"\n\n'What is this thing?'\n\n\\- It's an orange.\n\n'What are we learning?'\n\n\\-How to make orange juice.\n\n'Why would we do that?'\n\n\\-Orange juice is very healthy and tastes good.\n\n'Why didn't you tell me this at the beginning?'\n\n\\-I was trying to teach you how to do it.\n\n'FFFFFFFFFFFFFF'\n\nWhy does the normal teaching methods work for others but not me? How can people learn about a puzzle piece and how they go together without knowing what a puzzle is or what it's supposed to look like in the end? How can they just keep putting pieces together aimlessly and end up 'hey, that's a picture.

My IEP basically says that I\u2019m allowed extra time, able to use a computer instead of writing by hand, and some other stuff. \n\nI\u2019m in grade 11 and I\u2019m doing fully online school due to the pandemic. Instead of having 2 semesters with 4 classes each we have 4 semesters with 2 classes each, meaning the course load is heavier since the time is more condensed. \n\nThe 2 classes I\u2019m taking are grade 11 university level chemistry and grade 12 university level biology. I\u2019ve been getting lots of homework and with my mental illnesses + my ADHD, dyslexia, and other learning disabilities it takes me almost twice the time it takes others. \n\nSince school started, I\u2019ve been working until 10 or 11 pm at night without a lunch break (we don\u2019t have lunch breaks anymore) and I only stop for half an hour to eat dinner. I\u2019m honestly so burnt out and exhausted. \n\nYesterday I was having trouble with my biology assignment and my teacher took like 2 hours to help me individually which I really appreciated. I told her that I had something else due the same day and she was like \u201coh well you shouldn\u2019t be working all day and all night, you can hand in your biology assignment tomorrow. Go take a walk and have a snack.\u201d I literally started to cry because none of my teachers have really cared about that stuff. \n\nI was able to finish all my chemistry homework and then I had my chemistry project. It was due at midnight and I submitted mine at 12:30. A couple hours earlier, I asked for an hour or two hour extension because I didn\u2019t think I would complete it. I ended up finishing it earlier than I thought but I did hand it in around 30 minutes late. \n\nToday I got an email back from my teacher and he basically said \u201cWhen I give a project it is due at midnight, no later. I don\u2019t want you to rely on extensions\u201d and it was kind of harshly worded. \n\nEven though my IEP says that I get time and a half to complete tests and assignments. When I saw the email I felt so humiliated. I felt like he thought I was just being lazy and procrastinating when I swear I\u2019m not, I\u2019ve been working all the time and sleeping for like 5 hours a night. I haven\u2019t watched tv, played video games, or done anything like that since the class started. \n\nI just feel like I\u2019m so lazy and stupid now, and that I\u2019m trying to take advantage of my disability for my own personal gain. I feel like I don\u2019t work hard enough and I\u2019m just wasting all my time. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s my fault because before this, he\u2019s seemed really nice and he always tells about us about his travels across the world. (Except the first time I met him he asked me \u201cWhat are you?\u201d and I said I was adopted from China as a 10 month old baby. Then he asked me if I learnt to speak Chinese there and if I remembered anything) All of the popular students really like him and he always jokes with them during class.

I got perfect 4.0 GPAs both times. I think this is because I didn't have to take history or general classes. I was solely taking classes towards my degree in subjects I loved. I was earning two art degrees so I was taking only art classes.\n\nNow I'm trying to learn to drive and it is a nightmare. I have been practicing for hours and I can't grasp anything. My husband would like to know why that is. He thinks I must have a learning disability if I can study my ass off and it amounts to nothing.\n\nGP says I cannot be tested as I am out of school and past school age. I'd have to pay a lot out of pocket I assume.\n\nI have tried online tests for Autism and ADHD, but I just don't fit those moulds.

I was lucky to be born into a household with enough money and time to get me the help I needed, and because of my young age doctors were eager to work with me. As a result of this I was very lucky to be the recipient of different treatments and tutoring (if you were in the arrowsmith program please hit me up) that allowed me to pass as neurotypical by age ten. I preformed well academically all through high school and most of university as well. I'd never really felt disabled since then either, sure I was notorious for getting lost and stunned friends by not being able to process rap lyrics but other than that I was fine. But online school changed that. I had been taught how to learn at a young age and the sudden change in style of learning combined with my symbols relations weakness meant I just couldn't learn. For the fist time in my adult life I felt the impact of my disability. I find it hard to place myself back into the LD community however because a lot of people arent as lucky as I was, and talk about how they often struggled in school and all the challenges they experience and sense that I, someone who really likes school and has only begun to seriously struggled in my final year of it, don't fit into that narrative.

I was put in a special ed Math class, rather than my regular Math class. Later on in high school I had an \"IEP\", and a teacher referred to me as having a learning disability. \n\nMy problem is, they never told me I had a learning disability, or what my learning disability was. This has left me with a lot of confusion. They just put me in the class and I had an IEP, and that was that. I must have a learning disability, considering they put me in said situation, but I have no idea what the nature of it is. I mostly did well at English/Reading, and Math gave me the most trouble.

It is really very embarrassing and I find it very hard to talk about. I\u2019m hoping that there may be someone on here that can help me.\n\nI first heard the word dyscalculia back in secondary school around the age of 13. A teacher mentioned it to my parents and described it as \u201cdyslexia but with maths\u201d. Even though this teacher had brought this up to my parents, nothing ever got done about to. I never received any support and no research was ever done other than what I have looked into myself as I\u2019ve gotten older. \n\nAll these years later, I still have never passed my maths and even though it hasn\u2019t really affected jobs I\u2019ve gone for in terms of needing qualifications and stuff, it still bothers me and affects me every day. \n\nI recently got a job offer and was asked to figure out what my price would be. It\u2019s incredibly embarrassing but I\u2019ll admit I was stumped. I was desperately trying to work things out and although I can do basic maths like adding, subtracting, etc, it was incredibly hard for me to settle on what I thought was the right amount and if I\u2019d done my calculations right. I ended up with 4 different answers to the same question and had a panic attack. I cried for hours. The numbers just fall off the page when I look at them. If I\u2019m reading a sentence and there is a number in it milt mind instinctively skips over it. \n\nI want to specify that this is the only subject I have trouble with. I got good grades in all my other classes and did especially well in English. I have just never been able to do maths, and it\u2019s not from a lack of trying. \n\nRecently it has become more of a problem than ever, even affecting my relationship a bit. I really want to get diagnosed and think it\u2019s time I got some support, but I have no idea where to even start. Who do I go to? The doctor? A specialist? Do I need to have a lot of money to sort this out? Most websites I\u2019ve seen only give advice for people in the US and since it doesn\u2019t seem to be a very common thing I\u2019m not sure what my next move is.\n\nAny advice on this subject at all would be incredibly helpful if you have it. Even if it\u2019s just your own experience with this, it might give me some comfort.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 2015, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Dyscalculia in the UK?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/mfrgrr/dyscalculia_in_the_uk/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Newengland933", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_37mwx4b7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1616957015, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/mf70z3/i_cant_remember_names_or_terms_anyone_else_have/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mf70z3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/mf70z3/i_cant_remember_names_or_terms_anyone_else_have/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1616957322, "score": 1, "selftext": "Junior in college i\u2019m 28... i have a hard time remembering names and terms.

I'm on the road to seeing a neurologist for a meeting after a clear MRI. I've previously been tested and found not to have ASD spectrum disorders though many people I meet remain unsure of this diagnosis, and I am highly skeptical of a former anxiety diagnosis for similar reasons.\n\nAs background to the relevant part, I'm being investigated for sensory processing issues, and get migraines: those intertwine in description that sometimes the world is a bit grey, no input is enough (think wanting to hug for hours and hours on end and not being satisfied), and sometimes everything is too much even at tiny levels. That's the sensory part. What I'm curious about is the processing part.\n\nI was very academically able at school in terms of textbook and rote learning, memory, things like that. Very strong in languages, pretty good at maths. Doing A-Level back in the day I could get a question wrong and not understand \\*what\\* I had done wrong. I felt as though I had been taught wrong or that how everyone else was learning ran counter to what I needed and that I had underperformed, had to work far harder to scrape a good grade. Real-world things however...think Mr Bean on steroids. I tried driving lessons when I was 22/23 before work-stress had kicked in and potentially aggravated issues of sensory, and one time my instructor was positvely baffled when asking me a question, because I responded that I didn't understand the question. You can see the conflict straight away there. As I got older I realised I have a lot of information gaps, going both ways.\n\nAn information gap is my shorthand for a processing issue where someone says something, with a literal meaning from the words, and with a subtextual meaning from context, personality etc. Problem is, I don't get the subtext encoded bit, get confused, and things go wonky. And I've noticed having the same problem with sending subtexts too. This extends even to my family: my parents always got it backwards whether I was being dry or funny, managers at work, close friends, always seem to think I'm flapping when I'm not. It came up a lot at my last job and having started a new one recently, and experiencing the same thing, I'm now wondering if it's a me thing rather than a them thing. My father even, gets so frustrated with me to the point of swearing at me ( :'( ) when I explain that I don't understand something. I make an analogy of if a foreign languages student didn't understand; if a 5 year old wouldn't understand, you wouldn't get upset at them. People do at me though, and it's hell. I asked him earlier whether he notices it as a similar trait to that of the media portrayal of dementia and things of that nature having long since noticed that in myself (without any thought or fear of self-diagnosis or hypochondria therein), and he said it does remind him of that. It's like \\*folder not found\\* in my head. \n\nThe interesting bit is that there are then on the flip side times when I can soulread people who think they are hiding everything. One time my closest friend was sat quietly with me and thought she was poker-faced. I was like \"oh, you feel x because y and z\", and she was shocked. I'm the same at poker. Comes in useful with super-intuitions on how relationships will end once I know enough about someone in the beginning: not kidding, I've known precisely what someone would do before they did it, and never been wrong. Like a super red flag radar.\n\nDoes anyone relate to any of this nuclear mess?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1986, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Possible LD?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/m574jb/possible_ld/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "yourcookieduh", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_92hrp2fm", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1615549441, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/m3fveg/might_i_have_a_ld/", "gildings": {}, "id": "m3fveg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/m3fveg/might_i_have_a_ld/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1615549451, "score": 1, "selftext": "At first I really wasn\u2019t aware of such things as Lds but as I grew up I\u2019m genuinely more concerned about my mental health.

I don't know if you have ever felt lonely and low motivated when studying alone at home because you can't go to a library or coffee shop as liberal as pre-Covid. I know I have.\n\nI tried to watch study with me videos on YT, but I just feel it is lacking something\\~like, I am still alone by just watching... So, I am creating a virtual study zoom. You can join and study with others TOGETHER. You are watching and watched. Sounds creepy, but you got it, you are participating in it\\~ No obligations, you can choose to come/leave whenever you want to, and there will always be people there (hopefully soon, now it is just me, lol)\\~ no fee or talking or rules needed\\~ just show up and dedicate to your own work during that time. **Oh\\~Just one rule: MUTE yourself, please.**\n\nIt is a recurring meeting without a waiting room, which means you can join even if I am not there, and whenever you want to. Grab your own drink/coffee/snack, let's hold each other accountable, and get some work done :)\n\nZoom link: [https://asu.zoom.us/j/82954351559?pwd=TlRNNW1rZVFRREd4UlY3bURKejdmUT09](https://asu.zoom.us/j/82954351559?pwd=TlRNNW1rZVFRREd4UlY3bURKejdmUT09)\n\nPassword: selfstudy\n\nThis post was first posted on r/AskAcademia, and gain some positive feedback. So, I was thinking that maybe someone in here could benefit from it\\~ The idea behind this **Virtual Study Zoom** is a 24/7 virtual coffee shop (no fee or talking or rules needed)\\~ It is up to you to come/work/leave at any time, and there will always be people there. Hopefully, this zoom can grow bigger, so whenever you join, it will always have people studying/working there\\~ Even if there is nobody when you join, I hope this zoom can be a cue for you to focus on your tasks. Sometimes, you might be the only person sitting in a coffee shop, right? When you click on \"join the meeting\", hope the camera helps get you into the studying/working zone quickly and effectively.

Like it sometimes wasn't working correctly. About ten years ago I started thinking that I might have a learning disability. My father struggled alot on school and he said he always knew something was wrong with him. My brother was having issues in school and my dad realized that he was experiencing the same learning disability. He got him tested and diagnosed. \n\nWhen I started thinking maybe I had the same thing happening to me,  when I told my close friends and spouse that I thought I had a learning disability they all dismissed it saying things akin to you're so smart there is no way you have one.\n\nBut I struggle alot in my work.  I often misinterpret something I've read. Then based on that I will take an action that becomes a mistake. When my manager will ask my why I did what I did I would say something like that's what the email or memo or spreadsheet said. Then when they show me the item and ask where I read it, I'll look at the document again and then I see to my embarrassment and pure bewilderment as to how I misinterpreted it and I have no rational answer other than I'm sorry,  I misread or misunderstood it. It happens alot. It's humility and I spend so much time being angry at myself for being so stupid and why can't I stop fucking up all the time. \n\nI'm not lazy I work so hard to keep up. But I also get overwhelmed alot as well. And when things get busy I make alot of mistakes. I try really hard, but everything gets all scrambled in my brain. And I feel like I keep trying to stay above water but I feel I am drowning. \n\nI'm in a new job four months in and I literally cannot keep up. Everyday I feel like a failure. I'm putting in at least 10 hours a day just to keep up with the very basics and I can't even get to the extended parts of my job. I wasn't prepared that they would expect me to hit the ground running. I was only a month in when they gave me my two accounts! One of them was one of the most complex accounts they had. I felt like I was trying to catch all the falling ashes of a fire and never being able to get close to doing that.  Finally one of the senior members of my team went to my manager and said that the account was too complex for a new employee. Relief flooded me. I felt I totally let my manager down. The replaced the complex account with 10 more a accounts and I am back to not keeping up. I'm still drowning. And I am trying so, so hard but as I said earlier I get overwhelmed by too much coming at me and then I get confused. I hit the wrong buttons in our systems. I'll misread a communication and send an answer to the wrong company.\n\nDoes the misreading/interpreting thing sound like a learning disorder?\n\nWhat about the overwhelmed and confusion?\n\nOr am I just someone that has low intelligence?\n\nI've always known something was wrong with me.  I just want to be able to find out what it is and if I can be fixed. \n\nI welcome any thoughts or opinions. Just please be nice. Putting this there for people to judge makes me very vulnerable. \n\nOh and one more thing from what I've seen getting tested is like 1 to 2 thousand dollars.

of processing issue for a while now, but it is painfully apparent in group situations where I'm expected to learn a new skill or task. I was at a work training the other day where we had to learn to administer medication via needle to an opioid overdose victim. The instructor did a talk-through demonstration and had attendees practice using needles on a soft squeeze ball. I have no idea what I was thinking but pulled the plunger part of the syringe out entirely and started pushing it into the solution to draw it out... you're supposed to loosen the plunger lightly and then use your thumb to pull it upwards to draw the solution out, then push remainder of the air out. My solution starts sputtering, I'm staring blankly at it, knowing I'm fucking up but frozen in place. I was the last one in the room to finish and had to be walked through by the instructor who I noticed noticing me screw up from across the room.\n\nI'm going to guess this is in part performance anxiety (I tend to have social anxiety in general, though it has improved as I entered my mid-20s), but I am generally very bad at learning new practical skills and following instructions exactly. If someone verbally tries to walk me through something step-by-step, it gets jumbled up in my head and feels entirely foreign; I end up fumbling. First, I am tasked with remembering the order of steps, then have to translate it to reality while remembering how to position my hands, body, etc. for optimal performance. Sometimes other questions arise in the process and distract me. After multiple tries, doing it on my own, writing steps down etc., I can eventually grasp it but not without concentrated effort. From observation, it seems to be straightforward for most other peers.\n\nIn addition... I've always been very spacey, day-dream-y, and in my own head, out of touch with reality. I have considered dyscalculia as I struggled immensely with math and failed statistics in university. Was only able to pass working closely with a tutor. I'm uncoordinated, seem to have poor spacial awareness, and have trouble processing double negatives used in language.\n\nI'm capable of critical thinking, question the nature of reality among other things, and can grasp various abstract (usually philosophical) concepts to a moderate degree of understanding. But I express difficulty doing things that would seem like common sense and it makes me feel incredibly stupid and incompetent.

With a lot of studying, memorization and taking the easier paper, I managed to pass the O level. However it's been 4 years since the O level and since I ever studied any math. All the skills I learned to get the O level are completely gone, and my math has degraded worse than ever before because I never practice it.\n\nNowadays I cannot do anything beyond 2nd grade math. I cannot estimate the length or weight of objects. I can do virtually no math calculations in my head. For my whole life I kept using my fingers to calculate. I failed at manning the cash register because I kept taking wayyyyy too long at calculating change, and often gave people the wrong change. People have called me stupid, retarded, looked at me like I've grown a second head because I couldn't do a simple addition like 30+16. Somehow I sometimes fail calculations and mathematical reasonings even with a calculator.\n\nI feel that my terrible maths is affecting my life. So many people from all ages and backgrounds have looked at me like I was crazy because I couldn't make a simple calculation or mathematical reasoning. I cannot estimate the length or weight of things, which sometimes affects my hobby for baking as well as some other life situations that require those things. I absolutely cannot work as a cashier, which is a real detriment to me.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if I have dyscalculia or not because I don't display many of the symptoms I've read about. On regular clocks I have no trouble telling time (though sometimes I do on those with funky, non-number designs like the Roman numbers, and sometimes I confuse AM and PM). I can tell the days of the week, months of the year and numbers in order. I can estimate time without flaw and am not late to anything. I don't lose my bearings and have a great memory of routes.\n\nPlus, at this point it feels like I'm overdoing the labels.

I've been born around 14.02.1997\n\nI also have been diagnosed with learning disability since i was a child. I can't remember what age, but when i had to go to first grade, it wasn't a normal school, it was a class, which we call in Finland ''Pienryhm\u00e4'' I also have had OCD symptoms during my childhood such as compulsive hand washing, symmetry obsessions,Checking, and recently I've had obsessive thoughts.\n\nI have not been diagnosed with OCD of any form.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this small group class i was heavily bullied. I had 2 name calling names. such as ''squeaky toy'' ''stutterer''. Around this time i had a stuttering problem, and making noises around the class because i was not paying attention at all, and mostly  i just were making noises because i was bored during the class. i would sometimes daydream and think about  what games i'm going to play after school or what are we going to do outside with my childhood friends.\n\nAt age 12 i was put into a epilepsy test and they would test me in a hospital. they tested my brain by putting me some kind of device around my head and i would have to sleep during the time they were reading my brain. The tests came as negative and i had no ''problems in my brain''\n\nAs i kept getting older i had to be moved into a different school because of my bullying and my difficulties to not keep able to be on track with other students. This time it was different. This school was specifically designed for people who are disabled/have severe learning disabilities.\n\nWhen we had this discussion with the principal i cried. I did not want to go there. But i had no other choice.\n\nSo around 2009 i was moved into this school. During the years i studied there it was horrible. I felt... like i was some kind of test subject the government keeps eye on us.. everything was so strict as well.for example: No kissing, showing other affection to other human being if you liked other student (the only way you could show you liked a student romantically  would be by hugs and holding hands but not kissing for some reason)\n\nthe teachers had this overly positive attitude as well which  annoyed me a lot. Like they were talking to children.  I was on 7 grade by the way, and this kept going nonstop until 9 grade. I tried to fight back the education system they were handing to us but it just gave me bad numbers. Everything considered violent subject we would have would be banned/not to be talked about. We didn't even had history. Biology. nothing. The hole education system was litterly made for fucking children. Some of the teachers would hold you're hand if you would not be able to succeed on a task. for example ( We had household class where we basically cook, and one time i was squashing tomatoes to make some sauce and one of the teachers came to me and started to show me how it's ''apparently done'' by taking me by the hand. ) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to my parents, my mom is probably the most supportive person in my life. My dad on the other hand is narcissistic, \n\nhas a temper and overall he's a pretty shitty person. During midsummer two years ago, he said that i'm not he's son and i should leave he's fucking house immediately because i didn't want to help him for some task (he was drunk) \n\nHe would get pissed off at the smallest things, He did shouted at me during my childhood which lead me to running to my room crying.He also cheated on my mother, lied to her kept promises about he's going to change but he didn't do a shit to change himself. just false promises. He's a piece of shit who can't admit if hes wrong. (My dad has also learning disability)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to woman/relationships I've had last relationship around 6 years ago. It was not searius but during that time i had no social skills, i was really awkward and shy.\n\nI would never leave my parents house, i would be sitting my ass off playing games all summer all day long. Until a few years ago i started working out, started to talk to people and getting out of my comfort zone. A lot of woman/men have told that I'm attractive looking. a few woman have also stated that i'm a good talker/kisser as well, but since i'm shy i'm having a hard time to start conversations. \n\nHonestly life felt good for the time when i was studying. But after i graduated from Vocational school, everything started to slowly fall apart. My first ever job would be face-to-face fundraiser but i got fired because i would not get enough donations.\n\nAfter that last year, i had to go to a IQ test which was in social insurance institution of Finland in my town. Basically after the face-to-face fundraiser i couldn't find a job, i kept sending CV'S to companies, to the simplest jobs that there is, but i would just not get a response, that's why they suggested that i would take one of these IQ test and i agreed.\n\nSo after the first time i went to this IQ test, and during this IQ test i was really nervous,anxious,uneasy and i just wanted it to end. Since the psychologist didn't have that much time, we had to make it to 2 sessions.Every session lasted around 1-2 hours. Every time after these sessions, i would just go to the bathroom and cry. He gave me a IQ of 36 if i remember correctly and it fucked up my self-esteem for a very long time, still to this day. I even skipped exam day to a acting school where i had a chance to go to try my luck. I didn't read for the exams, i was so fucking lazy and depressed that i just gave up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then I've had possibly starting depression, I've also have had suicidal thoughts. I have self-harmed. Last summer around 1.6.2019 i was out drinking with my friends. My friends dropped me into a pizzeria because i wanted to get some pizza (Ya know drunk munchies?) after i got my pizza i walked home since i live nearby it. So i get inside my house and open the pizza box and just start crying. I get up from my computer chair head to the kitchen and slit my finger (Index-point finger) the wound was pretty bad so i had to call a ambulance. \n\nEver since then i have stopped completely just trying. I don't clean anymore. I don't do the dishes. i don't cook anymore. I can do them all by myself, but my mom keeps helping me since i had a trouble learning stuff in my childhood, and she has that kind of personality that she wants to help people, and i honestly sometimes i feel like shit because of it. That i can't even fucking take care of myself currently. I used to have a passion for acting/theater but it's all gone. All what i do is sit at home play video games, watch porn try to work out to keep myself in shape/meeting my friends and trying to meet people so my social skills wont shrink. ( I'm quite lonely and isolated )\n\nMy friends could be the best people I've ever met in my life. I think that they accept me for the person who i am but since we don't really share that much interest to other things (other than theater) we're really not that close. My psychiatric-doctor says that i just have to believe in my self but i am in a point where i think this is it. This is the situation where i will be for god sake how long. On this fucking hole. Miserable hole. I just don't know what to do. I have no energy to motivate myself anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you read the hole post i appreciate it.

I'm going to write an abridged story of my life for some context and then ask some questions.\n\nI'm a 24-year-old, male college student who was determined to have a learning disability at the age of 5 or 6. An attempt was made to help me overcome these difficulties while in a public elementary school, but their intervention was not acquited enough. I was formally evaluated and it was determined I had dyslexia and an audio processing disorder. So my parents decided to send me to a private school that specialized in teaching individuals with dyslexia and ADHD where I thrived.  At the same time, I started receiving regular speech therapy for my audio processing disorder. I graduated from high school and then went to college.  \n\nThroughout this period of my life, I spent a lot of time working one on one with adults and my father. I spent a lot of time in various therapies for my disabilities in and out of school. I spent a lot of time helping my father maintain properties he owned because he made me feel guilty about the amount of money I was costing him and I was very handy while he was not at. (Also, he is dyslexic and most like has an undiagnosed mental health disorder.) This guilt I felt also compelled me to push myself to the limit to succeed in school. It turned me into a workaholic. To this day its hard for me focus on anything but my current job.  \n\nSo by the time I finished high school, I feel I was emotionally and socially stunted. I did not have many close friends and had grown apart from my friend from elementary school. The individual I graduated high school with all were friendly with me but never felt like they truly enjoyed my company. I felt they simply were nice since I was willing to help them with schoolwork or if there was a group project that could be counted on for doing a lot of the work. All of this compounded my tendency for introversion and lead to many failed friendships. \n\nI just never feel like I connect with people. I believe part of my difficulties are related to my disabilities. I speech strangely because of speech impediment, have trouble understanding social cues and sarcasm because of the autoprocessing disorder, and when I tell them I'm dyslexic, they have trouble getting over the fact I do well in school and have a learning disability. At least that what it seems like to me. Because of this, I'm quiet and introverted around strangers and new social situations cause anxiety so much so I try to avoid them to some degree. \n\nSo I went to a small college and studied physics with an interest in going into engineering. The school had an agreement with a major university that would let me transfer after three years to it and receive two degrees. One from the small college and one from the large university. This program also has the option to stay for a third year to earn a master's degree.  I ended up staying for four years at my small college where I got comfortable and it was relatively easy for me to get summer jobs at the college. I still wanted to go into engineering. So I applied to the major university, got accepted, and got a full ride. This left with the choice of deferring my graduation and going to school for at least two more years or entering the workforce. I chose to stay in school and work on earning an engineering degree since I figured it would help my future career and I have fears about going into the work force. \n\n I'm now at this point in my life where I feel very anxious about my future career and relationships. I have been successful in school because of a lot of hard work but that came at the cost of developing other interests and spending time with friends and I'm very much a workaholic. \n\nI'm starting to apply to internships and have a lot of anxiety about interviews and succeed in the work world. I know that success is based on hard work and relationships, but I'm afraid that my disabilities will hold me back.  That I will finally get an interview but I'll be too quiet and/or not interview well. Any advice?\n\nIn some respect, I feel like the path of least resistance would be good which would be to continue my education and get my master and maybe PhD since I mostly avoid the social stress of interviews and demands of the real world. I can just do research within academia for a few more years and maybe for the rest of my career. But I feel like this a bad idea in the long run because I feel academia has a lot of problems and the private sector is more opportunities. \n\nI feel like starting my own business might be a good career chose, but I do not feel like I have social skills for it or any ideas and after being in school so long my natural drive has gone. It's hard for me to focus on task to completion that I'm not receiving a grade for or being paid for.\n\nI'm starting to ramble so I'm going to end this post.\n\nAny advice for someone with multiple learning disabilities and social anxiety/problems would be helpful. I'm dying to have true relationships with others and have a successful career.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1112, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Dyslexic with Audio Processing Disorder seeking Life, Internship/Job, and Social Advice.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/el0ei9/dyslexic_with_audio_processing_disorder_seeking/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwaway777xxxxx", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3xwgxfco", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578148611, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/ejxc0l/would_i_be_able_to_get_accommodations/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejxc0l", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/ejxc0l/would_i_be_able_to_get_accommodations/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578190188, "score": 3, "selftext": "Recently I requested to have accommodations for this math class I'm taking at my college this semester.

And then when I struggled there when my mom would help me with homework and it seemed impossible she would threaten to put me in classes for people with disabilities as if it was something to fear.

A part of the assignment is to interview someone with a disability I'm curious about and interview them.\n\nAnyhow, here are some of my questions:\n\n1. What is dysgraphia, to you?\n2. Is there any kind of help regarding this type of learning disability, whether it be in school or the workplace?\n3. How has dysgraphia affected your life?\n4. What are some of the biggest challenges a person with dysgraphia can face?\n5. How were you diagnosed?\n6. Is dysgraphia treatable?\n7. Are there any social difficulties, for a person with dysgraphia?\n8. What would like other people to know about dysgraphia?\n9. Has the use of technology for dysgraphic people been a good thing, or a bad thing?\n10. What do you think about your writing?\n\nAnswer as much you can.

I can usually get by on recognition memory if I'm taking tests (multiple choice), etc. but if I'm asked a question and to elaborate on it using my knowledge, I have an extremely hard time.

My dilemma is as follows: \n\nTL;DR: 14y/o niece lives with me/ needs LD testing/ I'm unfamiliar with state and gov. resources, please help\n\nMy niece (14) is living with us for the school year and does distance learning via a public online school system. She is a freshman in high school and should have failed the previous three grades/ or at least been held back for evaluation and given an appropriate individual education plan (IEP). I do not fault her mom because she has three other kids and put a lot of trust in the public school system- she is not familiar with the process of IEPs. At one point my niece was diagnosed with ADHD, however, she is not on medication and has no treatment plan. \n\nMy husband and I have been working with my niece one-on-one and have noticed significant gaps in her knowledge that do not make sense for someone her age or at her grade level. For instance, she expressed concern about struggling with the multiplication table- my thought was that this is normal, I still have trouble with my 8-12s on occasion... she is having trouble with multiplying things by 2 and adding single digit numbers. We explained that when you multiply by 10s you add a zero- this made no sense to her no matter how we explained it (visually, verbally, with blocks). She does not understand the concept of division no matter how many different ways we explain it. I looked this up and came across dyscalculia. She has never been evaluated for this, but it seems to fit. \n\nI work with her on English, science, geography and social studies as well, and we've run into issues with memory and retention as well as comprehension. She makes more grammatical errors in her speech than is typical of a freshman in high school and she does not understand higher level/ high school or junior high level vocabulary. Explaining root words confuses her. When she reads, she seems to use whole word recognition rather than phonics and will regularly substitute words that change the meaning of the sentence. She does not seem to retain verbal information well, and we use different strategies to incorporate new topics into everyday activities. \n\nI have never had a child evaluated for learning disabilities, but I looked into a clinic here that does it and it would end up being about 10-20k out of pocket. I know that this can't be the only way to get my niece evaluated. Does the school district have any responsibility for helping with this?

And I can't shake the feeling that my co-workers must be thinking \"What's wrong with this guy? Why's he asking so many questions?

So instead of three meaning three, three is just a name for an idea that doesn't make sense.\n\nBut someone just told me about all of the spacial awareness and memory problems that come with Dyscalculia and I found myself relating to every single one. Going off of ADDitude's \"Dyscalculia Symptoms in Adults at Home\" (https://www.additudemag.com/dyscalculia-in-adults-symptoms-signs-and-statistics/):\n\nI'm 23 and still count on my fingers to add\n\nHave no idea what a reasonable tip is, have to ask my fiance or Google it. \n\nHave trouble remembering dates and phone numbers (It took me four years to figure out my fiance's birthdate. And I still do not know his cell number even though it's has never changed). I can usually remember the month of an important date but the actual day often evades me. I also sometimes misjudge how far away a date is on the calendar. Mixing up \"this coming weekend\" and \"two weekends from now.\"\n\nI don't drive due to driving anxiety, but when I was learning I was often under the speed limit, and always thought I was closer to the line than I actually was.\n\nIf someone tells me a string of numbers, I will not remember it. My bank called and gave me an activation code to type in to my banking app. Usually I write down the numbers as the robot is saying them, but I didn't have anything to write with. By the time I switched from the phone call to the app, I had switched around a few of the numbers and forgotten the rest. My fiance had to recite it for me. I was surprised that he had no problem remembering.\n\nIf I have to remember the answer to an equation, I  sometimes have to repeat it to myself or else I will forget and have to start over\n\nI often get lost in new places. Or if I'm in a familiar place but go a different way. North and South have almost no meaning to me; if you asked me what direction I'm currently facing I could not tell you. and it takes me longer to create a mental map of places than I think it takes most people. If I'm facing a different direction than before, the whole map is messed up.\n\nI'm a decent dancer, but I've always noticed it takes me longer to learn steps than the other girls who have been dancing just as long as I have.\n \n.\n\nThe thing is, I'm not terrible at math. It was my worst subject, but I never failed anything simpler than a trig test. I've always understood that 7 is more than 5. I know \"seven\" means this many things. Can add (although I use my fingers, like I said). I know what mathematical symbols mean, and I can remember equations as well as most people who are only okay at math.\n\n I was even put into advanced math in third grade. But I've often spoken about how I believe my school was wrong to do this; that I should have been moved up a grade and received *extra* help in math. I never learned multiplication tables as a result of advanced math going through them too quickly, and me just not getting it. I would often think I was doing a math problem perfectly, only to get the question wrong and not understand why. When I was moved up, *then* I was aware of how much I didn't understand, which is when I started saying I was \"bad at math.*\n\nWord problems are hard for me, and word problems that are spoken to me are almost impossible. Even ones that don't really include numbers. Never figured out \"if two trains leave at the same time-\"\n\nI did well in statistics in college, though it was the hardest class I've ever taken. The professor kept saying \"people are always scared of statistics because of the math. But the math is easy. It's the procedure that's hard.\" But I had no problem with the procedures. What was tripping me up was the simple addition and multiplication, giving me wildly illogical answers or answers that were not one of the choices.\n\nSo my question is: does this seem like Dyscalculia? I'm on the fence, because it seems like I have a lot of symptoms, but not the main \"not understanding numbers or the symbols that denote the numbers\" symptoms. Is it a milder case? Am I just clumsy and bad at dates? Still bitter about being in advanced math when I was an advanced reader and okay at math? Should I just get tested instead of asking Reddit? (Yes)\n\nTdlr: have a lot of symptoms of Dyscalculia, but I'm not really tripped up by quantities or counting or what mathematical symbols mean or anything.

Going off of ADDitude&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Dyscalculia Symptoms in Adults at Home&amp;quot; (&lt;a href=\"https://www.additudemag.com/dyscalculia-in-adults-symptoms-signs-and-statistics/):\"&gt;https://www.additudemag.com/dyscalculia-in-adults-symptoms-signs-and-statistics/):&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 23 and still count on my fingers to add&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have no idea what a reasonable tip is, have to ask my fiance or Google it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have trouble remembering dates and phone numbers (It took me four years to figure out my fiance&amp;#39;s birthdate. And I still do not know his cell number even though it&amp;#39;s has never changed). I can usually remember the month of an important date but the actual day often evades me. I also sometimes misjudge how far away a date is on the calendar. Mixing up &amp;quot;this coming weekend&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;two weekends from now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t drive due to driving anxiety, but when I was learning I was often under the speed limit, and always thought I was closer to the line than I actually was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone tells me a string of numbers, I will not remember it. My bank called and gave me an activation code to type in to my banking app. Usually I write down the numbers as the robot is saying them, but I didn&amp;#39;t have anything to write with. By the time I switched from the phone call to the app, I had switched around a few of the numbers and forgotten the rest. My fiance had to recite it for me. I was surprised that he had no problem remembering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I have to remember the answer to an equation, I  sometimes have to repeat it to myself or else I will forget and have to start over&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I often get lost in new places. Or if I&amp;#39;m in a familiar place but go a different way. North and South have almost no meaning to me; if you asked me what direction I&amp;#39;m currently facing I could not tell you. and it takes me longer to create a mental map of places than I think it takes most people. If I&amp;#39;m facing a different direction than before, the whole map is messed up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a decent dancer, but I&amp;#39;ve always noticed it takes me longer to learn steps than the other girls who have been dancing just as long as I have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I&amp;#39;m not terrible at math. It was my worst subject, but I never failed anything simpler than a trig test. I&amp;#39;ve always understood that 7 is more than 5. I know &amp;quot;seven&amp;quot; means this many things. Can add (although I use my fingers, like I said). I know what mathematical symbols mean, and I can remember equations as well as most people who are only okay at math.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was even put into advanced math in third grade. But I&amp;#39;ve often spoken about how I believe my school was wrong to do this; that I should have been moved up a grade and received &lt;em&gt;extra&lt;/em&gt; help in math. I never learned multiplication tables as a result of advanced math going through them too quickly, and me just not getting it. I would often think I was doing a math problem perfectly, only to get the question wrong and not understand why. When I was moved up, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; I was aware of how much I didn&amp;#39;t understand, which is when I started saying I was &amp;quot;bad at math.*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Word problems are hard for me, and word problems that are spoken to me are almost impossible. Even ones that don&amp;#39;t really include numbers. Never figured out &amp;quot;if two trains leave at the same time-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did well in statistics in college, though it was the hardest class I&amp;#39;ve ever taken. The professor kept saying &amp;quot;people are always scared of statistics because of the math. But the math is easy. It&amp;#39;s the procedure that&amp;#39;s hard.&amp;quot; But I had no problem with the procedures. What was tripping me up was the simple addition and multiplication, giving me wildly illogical answers or answers that were not one of the choices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question is: does this seem like Dyscalculia? I&amp;#39;m on the fence, because it seems like I have a lot of symptoms, but not the main &amp;quot;not understanding numbers or the symbols that denote the numbers&amp;quot; symptoms. Is it a milder case? Am I just clumsy and bad at dates? Still bitter about being in advanced math when I was an advanced reader and okay at math? Should I just get tested instead of asking Reddit? (Yes)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tdlr: have a lot of symptoms of Dyscalculia, but I&amp;#39;m not really tripped up by quantities or counting or what mathematical symbols mean or anything. Is this a thing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dyscalculia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r2co", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dyscalculia", "subreddit_subscribers": 1640, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Dyscalculic but okay at math?", "total_awards_received": 0, "ups": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dyscalculia/comments/d7bcr9/dyscalculic_but_okay_at_math/", "user_reports": [], "view_count": null, "visited": false, "whitelist_status": null, "wls": null}], "domain": "self.dyscalculia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/d7bkft/sharing_here_for_more_input_dyscalculia/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d7bkft", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/d7bkft/sharing_here_for_more_input_dyscalculia/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569078076, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 937, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Sharing here for more input (Dyscalculia)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569164459, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dyscalculia/comments/d7bcr9/dyscalculic_but_okay_at_math/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Dyslexicdiaries", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4hm2n30b", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569041435, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/d767os/why_they_call_it_non_verbal_learning_disability/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d767os", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/d767os/why_they_call_it_non_verbal_learning_disability/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569041437, "score": 14, "selftext": "Like my only avergage-ish strengthns are verbally.Everything else i am really bad in.like the things that matter-the meat of a burger-processing speed,working memory.It completely baffles me.i defts have some sort of learning disability because ive struggled so much and never knew why.

Female. Still living at home and for years I\u2019ve coped with my fears by living in daydream world most of the time.\n\nI work retail. Part time. Can\u2019t get full time and honestly, it\u2019s because of very deep rooted fears and problems.\n\nI have learning difficulties. Have all my life, though tbh, nothing ever really came of it for me \u2013 help wise. I think it helps that my struggles don\u2019t come from say, writing. Sitting down in class and writing out stuff was easy for me. It\u2019s so easy for things to go unnoticed when school isn\u2019t paying attention to every angle of learning difficulties. \n\nMy real struggle came with Math, and most of all in hands on tasks.\n\nA great example is I remember our art teacher folding paper and having us copy her. I don\u2019t remember what we were making; maybe it was a paper airplane. \n\nWhat I remember is by the third fold, I was confused. I couldn\u2019t recall in my brain what she had just done. It\u2019s funny, my imagination was and always has been wild. I can picture a dragon in insane graphic detail. I can create fantasy worlds in my brain with insane detail. But I couldn\u2019t form in my head the fold she\u2019d just made. I\u2019d look at the other students and try and see what they were doing but my brain couldn\u2019t make any sense of it.\n\nBy the time the rest of the class had finished I\u2019d always be the only one sitting there with a paper barely folded, totally lost and confused.\n\nThere\u2019s something about hands on tasks, comprehending verbal instructions and being able to make my hands do it I\u2019ve always struggled with. I mean, I can\u2019t tie my shoe laces even to this day (I buy shoes that don\u2019t have laces) and I could never master skipping with a jump rope.\n\nToday at work, my Manager wanted me going outside my comfort zone of just cleaning the Fashion department (folding, tidying, keeping the clothes all nice etc) I\u2019ve been working here five years and honestly that\u2019s pretty much just what I do, keep the department looking nice. It\u2019s a lot of work but it\u2019s not deemed important because anyone can do it right? They want me trying more stuff like helping with stocking etc.\n\nBut that requires the skills I don\u2019t have as silly as it might sound.\n\nIt involves being given instructions I have trouble comprehending. I\u2019ll be told get this and move this to put this here and it\u2019s all so fast I don\u2019t understand. Fashion already feels so full, I can\u2019t work out in my mind where I\u2019m supposed to put items when everything seems full. I\u2019m not good at looking at everything and figuring out how I\u2019d need to rearrange everything. Not to mention, they don\u2019t like you moving things out of their places. So my mind is all confused.\n\nToday I was made to put out rainboots, which should be easy, but it was a struggle. First, I stupidly stared confused. Where would the boots go? No room? The shoe department was fucking PACKED. My brain couldn\u2019t figure that out, where I was supposed to put them. Manager tells me move this stuff off here and put boots here. There\u2019s a spot my brain didn\u2019t even register that\u2019s getting a little empty and I can rearrange there.\n\nBut matters get complicated because the shelf, this four way, well the shelves are spaced out in a way where the boots are to tall to fit. So I need to fix the shelf spacing. Might be easy, if not for the fact I\u2019m not good at doing things with my hands, aka, I can\u2019t figure out how to get these shelves out. They\u2019re stuck so firmly in place. I struggle and struggle. It takes minutes to work one out, but then I have to move the other and nothing I do gets it to come off. I\u2019m beginning to panic now, feeling embarrassed. This Manager, who I already feel intimated by (sigh guys make me feel intimated) is hovering nearby. I can practically FEEL his judgement even though he\u2019s not speaking.\n\nI feel like a kid again. Trapped under the gaze of an adult, like my mom or a teacher who is annoyed and frustrated with me because I am to slow, can\u2019t figure out how to do something so basic. I haven\u2019t put a single boot out. I need to rearrange the shelving so these rainboots can fit, but if I\u2019m struggling this hard to remove them I\u2019m NEVER getting this done. I keep struggling with the shelf and it just doesn\u2019t make sense how to remove them.\n\nI end up putting some boots on the first shelf so it looks like I\u2019m doing something, panicking because I don\u2019t want to struggle with the shelf again because it\u2019s just so damn embarrassing to show off how I can\u2019t figure it out.\n\nManager comes over, tells me I have to put the boots up by size. He then ends up without a word spacing out the shelfs for me, and again I feel like a child. The amount of times in my life an adult (or my mom) would get so frustrated with me they\u2019d just take over is uncountable. Eventually people always realize I\u2019m to stupid to do it myself and to speed it along they do it. I mean hell I even remember trying to bake with my mom and it would end up with her doing it all as I watched. There\u2019s only so much of ME people can handle before they think, let me just do it and get it done.\n\nAnd it\u2019s humiliating and shameful because I\u2019m always grateful when they do. Thank god. Please. Do it for me, I\u2019m humiliated and want to die but if you do it, it speeds along my suffering.\n\nI go back to putting the boots but of course I mess up how I\u2019m doing it and am told that. Kids sizes are weird toddler is 13, 12, 11, kids 1, 2 and 3. I had started putting sizes in order of 1, 2, 3 , 11, 12, 13 but no it\u2019s supposed to be smallest to biggest aka 13, 12, 11, 3, 2, 1 backwards. Also I should know this, shouldn\u2019t I, working here for years lmao. But I never really think about it.\n\nMy brain feels all frazzled. I think I\u2019m having an internal panic attack. I think I get those a lot. I don\u2019t freak out or cry or scream I just inside am dying and freaking out. Focusing is hard. But also it\u2019s all I can do because I have to beat the shame and I can only do it by completing the task. It\u2019s like a kid again, forced to focus on Math homework because there\u2019s no escape I\u2019m trapped by the one who is charge and I can\u2019t go until I\u2019m released from their grasp. I want to go back to daydreams about dragons or daydreaming about how much I wish I was in some other universe. \n\nEventually the task is done. It was a simple task and yet I felt like I\u2019ve never worked harder in my life I wanted to crawl into a hole and die from the embarrassment of how hard the task was for me to do. And my Manager was there hovering and saw it all. Maybe if I was alone I\u2019d have done better, the humiliation of knowing I\u2019m being judged gives me such bad anxiety I perform even worse in these conditions. \n\nThe Manager ends up pulling a teenager in to do some help with us and it\u2019s obvious she catches on faster and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s pleased and seems to want her to start working more in Fashion. He even jokes with her a little. I think about how I\u2019m so intimated by him and how I can\u2019t picture talking to him casually. I also think about how there are other teenagers in fashion more involved than I am, when I\u2019ve been working here for years. They move about with more confidence than I do, that\u2019s for sure. \n\nSpeaking of which, ever experienced the humiliation of a teenager having to help you do things or teach you things? I sure have. I remember getting into a bad situation at cash in Electronics and one of the teens walked by and helped me out. I was so grateful but felt shame. I should be helping HER, I\u2019m 29 for god\u2019s sake! I feel like the teenager most of the time. \n\nI don\u2019t like going out of my comfort zone and why is this? Well I know the answer. I\u2019ve been talking about it. When I step out of my comfort zone, I humiliate myself. I show the people in charge I struggle to understand their instructions. I show them I can\u2019t figure out how to use basic equipment. I show them I can\u2019t even figure out how to remove a shelf. I show them I\u2019m incompetent, and it hurts. \n\nI try and tell myself I have gotten better at some things. Fun fact, I got fired from my first job ever as a Cashier because I was so bad (didn\u2019t make it through training lmao) and at this job started off as a Cashier but thank god the Manager at the time was a nice man who pulled me aside and told me he was moving me to Fashion because he didn\u2019t want me stressed at work all the time. I was told it was okay I didn\u2019t feel comfortable working on Cash.\n\nBut since my mom was putting pressure on me for full time a few years later, and I was told I needed some cash experience to get full time (covering breaks in electronics) I allowed myself to get cash numbers and learn. However I\u2019m still bad at it and only manage because most purchases are debit in electronics and no memorizing of food codes. I can do it at a VERY slow pace but still cannot handle it fast without getting confused and being incapable.\n\nMy last full time interview was humiliation city \u2013 I went in believing I could get full time for sales floor, just keeping the store zoned and neat and covering the breaks and am basically told I\u2019m not good enough and I need to be able to do front end and actually work stock and all that involves. They liked my positive attitude though and put up a plan for me to teach me more, having this manager in fashion teach me. She was really chill and very nice and patient though I still felt anxious training with her because I never felt good enough and like I could keep up. I was funnily enough older than her by like 4 or 5 years I think, but as usual I felt intimated by her too even though she was so kind, her being so close to my age but younger kinda made it hard, because I just felt so embarrassed.\n\nWhen she left, the whole training plan thing was forgotten and I never tried to pursue it, because I simply cannot stand the shame and embarrassment I feel when I struggle and people are watching me and judging me. Especially with our new Manager, who is a guy and is all business mostly. I miss her, our old Manager and wish I could have learned more with her. \n\nI like to keep how much I struggle a secret. But I can never really keep it.\n\nI don\u2019t even want full time but as my mom likes telling me, they won\u2019t be around forever to take care of me. I can\u2019t work full time forever. But I\u2019m not good enough to get it here and I every job I look it seems even worse. If I have so much trouble with basic tasks, how will I be good enough everywhere else?\n\nI read job descriptions of other retail places and panic. So many situations I\u2019ll be put into to be humiliated. To be trapped again with nowhere to run. For people to learn my dirty little secret. \n\nI\u2019m so\u2026. Tired of feeling so worthless and stupid. I\u2019m so tired of it. The only thing I feel like I\u2019m good at is writing. I love writing little stories, co writing with people online like on discord or tumblr. But I\u2019m nowhere near writing a \u2018book\u2019 yet and doing something I could make money off of. I just enjoy doing it you know? \n\nI hate how I haven\u2019t made any movement in my life. I\u2019m 29, 30 in the winter. And I\u2019m still nothing.\n\nI feel jealous. Jealous of everyone who is smart and things come naturally too. Who just naturally are good at things or can catch on quickly. Who can go to school without fear \u2013 I did go to College and graduated but the program I went too wasn\u2019t for me. See, I have confidence I could go to College and pass again in something.

Why should you LHTL?\n\nIf  you don't LHTL you will not be able to learn effectively. What that  means is you either spend too much of time learning small stuff and feel  the efforts are not worth the gains or worse you will frustrate  yourself during the learning process because of your past poor learning  techniques. (we have seen this first hand). If the later happens,  doesn't matter whether or not you successfully learn a concept or solve a  problem, you will not be willing to come back and continue the learning  process as the skewed pain to gain ratio will make you feel like its  not worth it, thereby making you not play the long term game to see long  term results. The thing is you don't have to put yourself through so  much of pain to learn.\n\nThis isn't  to say that once you complete this course there won't be any confusion  or annoyance or stints of confusion or feelings of stupidity for not  understanding something when you begin to learn a new concept. This is  to say that, you can use these tried and tested techniques or tools that  someone else has already figured out to avoid the avoidable suffering  and embrace the necessary suffering or the meaningful suffering that's  part of the learning process.\n\nLife  is hard to begin with its wise to take all the available help that's  out there to make it a bit less painful. And then you won't have to end  up as failure (failed potential) filled with resentment.\n\nThese  tools will help you manifest your potential which would other wise be  wasted. The realization of wasting your potential (time and energy)  causes regret in the later part of life. As someone who had experienced  it recently let me make it very clear \"The realization was quite painful  and i will do everything in my capacity to put myself in a better  place. Trust me that isn't a place you will want to be in. Its not just  painful. Its pointlessly painful. That meaningless suffering makes you  suffocate. It frustrates you, makes you resentful (at the successful  people around you) and angry and that's painful and remember *pain argues for itself.\"*\n\nSo  the goal here is to teach yourself how to learn effectively without  frustrating yourself (AMAP) which will help you learn whatever that you  want to learn, which then can be used to purse whatever you find to be  meaningful and make a career out of.\n\nOne of reasons for where i am today and not where i wanted to be is because of the above.\n\nMy  definitions of learning was wrong very wrong. I was using poor  techniques to learn and setting unrealistic standards of learning based  on my wrong definitions. Of course i didn't meet those standards.\n\nHow could i?\n\nWho  the fuck thinks being able to recall everything i mean literally every  word in a book is true learning? I used to have thoughts such as what if  i forget the first word / part of the sentence when i reach the end of  the sentence or that i don't understand what i am reading?\n\nHow will i understand anything if i am thinking these thoughts right while i was reading?\n\nOf  course i failed meeting those stupid standards i set for myself and i  couldn't take it. I started stress reading, rereading again and again  like 3 times / 7 times / 11 times or some odd number of times believing  somehow that, that will make me remember what i read. I reread it so  much so that by the end of day the meaning of the text that i read  didn't matter or mean anything to me.  I would actually forget the  meaning of what i read. There is no big picture perspective of what i  read, no diffused mode kicking in or no meaning. Its just me reading and  rereading words like a maniac.\n\nBefore  i knew i became frustrated because i couldn't concentrate on what i was  reading while having to deal with these thoughts and anxious with the  thoughts about forgetting what i read. Thoughts like if say i learned  something and if someone asks me to explain and \"if i don't recall every  word in the book wouldn't they consider me a fraudster a cheat?\" were  constant. You might be thinking this doesn't make any sense, its stupid  to think like this or its irrational and yeah you are right it fucking  was irrational. But it somehow made perfect sense to me in the past so  much so that it made me feel like my life was dependent on that.\n\nI  saw forgetting something as a sin and let the voice in my head  painfully critique me. I tortured myself. This effected other parts of  my life and soon things spiraled down and i ended up in depression and  suicidal at 22. Yeah i know as stupid as it sounds all this shit sounded  real to me. It sometimes still does.\n\nEverything  that happened was because of me. I didn't think twice before accepting  what my mind was telling me. Never dared to question its stupid  standards. I don't even know how the fuck i came up with these  standards. This is the **real why? the why for why i have to take this seriously and**  fix this shit. My life really is dependent on it. Unlearn every god  damn thing that you have learned. Question every god damn standard  (trap) that your mind set up to kill you. Think through every standard   carefully with reason and chunk it if it doesn't make sense or seems  irrational. You would want to hang on to them despite it making no  sense. You might believe that your intuition with regards to those  standards might be right/true. But remember the same intuition drove me  to death. Now question yourself how good or useful is a intuition when  its self destructive in nature? Is it even a worthy intuition to pursue?  Time to let go of it and adopt new techniques and methods and redefine  learning standards and measuring techniques.\n\nWhat  do you guys think about this? Do i sound crazy? stupid? genius (lol  really?) clear thinker? Is there a flaw in my thinking process? Can i  reason better? Please i am looking for feedback on this thought process.  Its all in my head and i want to get it out. Its not easy to share such  stuff with people in real life hence i am turning out to you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1948, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Convincing my present self to take up the LHTL course", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/lpwb35/convincing_my_present_self_to_take_up_the_lhtl/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tavukveben", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_yu0oc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1614015066, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/lpud2l/how_do_you_function_as_an_adult_with_learning/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lpud2l", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/lpud2l/how_do_you_function_as_an_adult_with_learning/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1614015077, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have ADHD, Dysgraphia, Dyslexia, and SPD\n\nI've struggled all through school.

I can\u2019t dance at all, when choreography is involved it takes me 5 minutes to get one step, and then I end up forgetting it in a solid 3 three minutes. And I\u2019m excellent at every other class, except math. I was honors everything, but for math i was basic. So naturally I thought, \u201cWow, maybe this is it.\u201d So I messaged my math teacher about it and he said my counselor will be contacting me. She asked me three questions. Do you have anxiety? Do you take medication for your anxiety? Do you see a doctor for it? After I I answered yes with the exception of taking medication for it, she responded saying I wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the school\u2019s learning disability program because I have excellent grades. And that was it. She suggested talking to my counselor because it\u2019s most likely my anxiety. And now I just feel stuck. I thought MAYBE I found something that would explain everything. Only to get told it\u2019s my anxiety. Somehow, I do not believe that my anxiety is making me THIS bad at everything? If so I think I would have had issues in other classes as well. But that\u2019s what she told me so.. yeah. I guess I just don\u2019t know what to do now. I don\u2019t even feel like it was accurate, yes there is most likely a link between learning disabilities and poor performance but does that NECESSARILY mean you need to be failing your classes in order to have it? I don\u2019t know, maybe I was wrong. Maybe I was just cursed to be really stupid in math and smart in everything else.

I'm getting my testing re-established (it was done in the 80s) and I want to make sure I'm maximizing whatever the accommodations are that can help me.  The program is computer science and I can slog through it but it takes me A LOT LONGER (like 3x to 4x of other students for projects).\n\nIs there a forum or place where others with university learning-disability accommodations can discuss what accommodations are possible? Even though the disability counselors are really nice, I feel like I'm asking for favors from the university, and I'm not even really sure if I'm asking the right things, e.g., additional time is great, but how much is normal?  What's a typical \"accommodation offer\" if there is such a thing? Are there other things that help students (technology assistance) that I should think about?\n\nGrateful for any thoughts on that.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false,

I have a problem that is getting worse and I am not really sure what's causing it. Ever since I was very little, I couldn't read long pieces of literature. It was never a problem of attention span, since I could always keep my attention everywhere else (lectures, movies). I could read articles and New Yorker pieces and SAT-length passages. In high school I managed (rather well) to get by with sparknotes, and in college I paid people for notes. It just took too long to read the mammoth volume we were assigned, and I'd manage about a fifth of the total amount per week. But now it's a little humiliating that I'm over 25 and have not read a book in more than 10 years. Every time I try, I end up falling asleep, crying, reading the same sentence over and over again, sometimes trapped in ulterior thoughts and even music in my head. Again, this isn't a problem if I am listening to a lecture or watching a movie. I can watch 10 in a row without breaking focus. I've been tested for ADHD and other LDs twice (age 5 and 2 years ago) -- both times tested negative. I've been really trying to read more over quarantine, and while I can read magazines quite easily, books are becoming an even greater challenge. My family is full of M.A.s and PhDs, so this is really kind of humiliating. Since this isn't ADHD, and I know it sounds a LOT like ADHD, does anyone have any ideas what could this be (anything at all)? Could be neurological? I can't keep cheating my way through life like this, so I am trying to put things in order. I am beginning to fear that there could be physical aspects to this, not just psychological ones. searched long on reddit; this might very well be the best venue for this question. many thanks in advance, sorry to bother!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1929, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[posting anonymously for my bro]: have had serious trouble reading longer literature lately... what could be the issue?

The psychologist who said I had High functioning autism I only had one visit with, came up with his assessment based on 5 questions he asked my mom and I and observed my body language. The second psychologist and the speech pathologist who I went to at the Inland Regional Center said that I have comprehension and word sorting issues while trying to Express myself. \n\nFor more context: as a child I was hyperactive, spaced out/daydreamed alot, I had and still have issues with completing tasks especially if its difficult for me. Like I either have issues processing the information or when I do understand what to do it was hard to do it by myself without constant instructions. I also would get these impulses to hit and or throw things at others although I attribute that to my Simi unhealthy home life.

School is horrible for me, I can\u2019t follow simple instructions and can\u2019t even understand how to play simple dodge balls games in PE without the teacher always reexplaining the rules. \n\nMy math semester is ending on Monday and it was a terrible experience. I don\u2019t think I have ever gotten above 70% on a test in that class. And to make it even worse my dad pretty much teaches me everything after my teacher already explains it. For my last math test I studied about 2 hours a day for 5 days before my test and also had my dad one on one teaching me everything. I got 63% and it took me 2 and a half hours to do that test. I always try and pay attention in class but no matter how hard I try to focus the words just go trough me. Lots of kids in my school smoke weed all lunch and never do any homework and yet get high 80s and 90s\n\nI am terrible at English too. I spent 2 full days sitting in front of a blank google doc trying to write this overdue 2 paragraph assignment. Almost all my assignments were handed in overdue this semester for English. When the teacher explains something I can\u2019t figure out what to do unless I get extremely specific instructions and even then I can\u2019t do it a lot of the time. \n\nI am not sure if this is a symptom of a learning disability but I also have absolutely 0 friends and just sit around doing nothing in my free time and at lunch during school.\n\nI didn\u2019t know where to put this but my school situation has been making my life borderline torture.

So, how am I so bad at everything else motor / organization / space related?? Please read my post if my TLDR didn't make any sense xD\\]\n\n\\---Also! I was never diagnosed with any learning disorder, I just want to ask a question and couldn't find any more relevant place. I feel a bit of an \"impostor\" and odd to be using this sub-reddit, so I apologize if I'm somehow out of place or if you feel like I'm rude---\n\nHello,\n\nI'm a 27yo female :) It's a bit long but, I'd really like to find someone who relates to me!\n\nI always had a big problem understanding \"physical\" instructions (sorry I really struggle with coming up with a way to explain it, plus English is not my native language so I'm sorry xD). For example, in PE, all my life, I never understood when the teacher was explaining some physical game rules, or some sport rules. In general, I struggled a lot to understand things like organization change, if we have to move the tables in the classroom, or if today we were in another classroom, which line to go according to which bus you take, etc. For all those things, I somehow never understood the instructions, and I just survived by following and imitating everyone else. Teachers labeled me as passive and daydreaming - which was true, besides. xD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was supposedly gifted as a child (I took the test at 7) but with \"a huge emotional retardation\". I was bad at sport, kind of clumsy, I couldn't tie my laces by myself until an advanced age, etc, but nothing so serious it really affected my life or my grades. I was just super bad at sport, but like, it happens.\n\nAnd actually this \\*still\\* shouldn't bother me at all. I studied linguistics in university and as it was all very abstract (it didn't involve any movement), I got by easily.\n\n...BUT I'm now following a sound engineering program (yes I know it's weird bla bla bla), and actually, since we keep having to work with machines, plugging stuff and installing mics and consoles, etc, the same feeling as when I was in PE class came back :( and I actually find myself struggling A LOT to simply understand what the teacher is saying. I keep asking them to repeat themselves, and they sometimes seem to get a bit annoyed. I feel like I also bore other students.\n\nI have very good grades in theoretical subjects like physics as well as purely musical subjects, as I'm good at the piano (ah yes that's what makes any motor disorder impossible : I don't want to brag but I'm really good at playing the piano and have been starting at age 4 xD which is also why I'm so confused about myself \\^\\^\" --I should actually add that in the title), but I REALLY struggle with anything practical. I truly feel like the teachers are speaking another language when they tell us \"this machine goes there, then you go there, then you do that, and this button does this, etc\". They can say it 10 times, it just doesn't reach my brain. What I mean is, even though that kind of explanation probably seems fuzzy to everyone, my classmates seem to be able to immediately reproduce the movement they saw the teacher do, or follow the instruction they said - while as for me my mind is completely blank.\n\nI also have big problems with organization in general, especially time management. I've got 21 hours of lateness just for this semester. And if someone asked me, I wouldn't be able to explain why I was late. I have no idea. But, I have a friend who has a similar problem, and she doesn't have any learning disorder.\n\nI'm kind of old now xD so I don't know if going to a therapist or something would help me. But I was wondering if there was something wrong with me, or if it had another cause (maybe anxiety, or daydreaming too much, etc), or if at least someone experienced similar problems. (I just hope I explained myself clearly enough.)Maybe I'm just panicking for nothing and I actually understand everything just fine?Today I had a super hard day at university barely understanding what the teacher explained, asking him to repeat, and him telling me I should \"know all that by now as another teacher already went over that several times\". I said I truly listened but somehow I didn't understand. I almost cried XD So, coming back home, it's been bugging me and I've been feeling hopeless and wondering if maybe something was wrong with me.\n\nI found things about \"poor motor planning\" that might fit me somehow. But if I was so slow at tying my shoe laces or putting my coat on, how was I able to play piano classical pieces???...\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading :)  \n(And by the way when I say I felt like \"something was wrong with me\" : I hope I didn't offend anyone. I do feel like I'm lame regarding my studies right now, hence this feeling of being \"wrong\". But, if you have a disorder, I think there's really nothing inherently \"wrong\" with that or with you. I was just trying to describe my own feeling, not the disorder I may relate too.

following matter:\n\nFour years ago, my brother was diagnosed with Mild Learning Disability (IEP). He also has speech articulation problem like when he speaks his tongue moves up (unsure the exact word) which he is getting help for and is doing fine now. Over the year, he has improved (he is in Grade 8 now). His teachers mentioned that about him. In fact one of them said that at the end of Grade 8, do the learning test again. Apparently, yesterday school told us that he can\u2019t go to regular class and should be put in locally developed courses. The decision made was based on psychological report which was done in Grade 4/5 (unsure which grade). My question is can I hire a private psychologist and have a report done to see where he is now. My intuition tells me that he has improved though he needs help which we as a family are trying to do. Any advice is appreciated!

I take medication along with Concerta Er and no I don't have ADHD but I take that medication for memory. I love reading books. I love to read biographies and history. I even l draw and paint face portraits but I do it by using a reference. I'm a visual learner but I can't remember visually the details. I can remember the shape of the face, eyes, nose, and sometimes lips. and the color of the skin but I can't remember the details. I can't remember the texture or how the skin looks detailed. If I remember my mom or a person it easily pops up a picture that I've seen of her. But it looks kind of blurry. How is it that I'm a visual learner but I can remember visually later. Some people have a photographic memory and some people don't. I learn best when I read things with instruments background music so I can visualize the story of a book and that is easy. But I can't remember things visually. But I can remember the summary or topic but not detailed. Not sure if this will be helpful but I am right-handed and my IQ according to my neurological results is 79 and I'm 20 years old. My psychologist told me that I lack or have problems with abstract thinking. So I am trying to figure out if I am a visual learner because it does seem like I am but I can't remember things visually or words from a page or handwriting. I can remember what it is about but not visually. If I try to remember the face of a person or something visually their faces seem not blurry but like a bit black or black dots it's hard to describe it. I am trying to figure out a way that I can memorize. Now it is easy for me to remember voices and the tone of voices My hobbies are drawing face portraits, painting face portraits, cross-stitching, and reading biographies/autobiographies. I also love going to the library to rent books. I prefer books that are colorful and have a couple of pictures and visual demonstrations on them like a drawing or a cartoon. But I can't remember it visually however I can remember the concept of what it is about but not detailed. If I try to imagine a word in my head I can and be creative with that word by moving it or make it somehow transparent or I can see them as it is in front of whatever I am looking at but if I read a page from a book I can't remember the words but I can remember what it is about. So, I am trying to understand that. I love reading biographies and autobiographies and drawing facial portraits of people and I can remember what it is about but I can remember it visually which is why I use references. When I read a book I imaging it like a movie but later I can't recall it visually only when I am reading the book. I know this is funny but there are people who have a photographic memory like Temple Grandin and who are good with numbers and calculations like Katherine Johnson. And that can be rare to find out what exactly you are good at but I'm trying to figure it out. I can't remember things and how they look like because they seem a bit blurry. But I am a visual learner? So I am trying to figure that out. The best way for me to have a good memory. I love reading biographies, history, and autobiographies but I am bad when it comes to writing comprehension well I've been told this many times. I can write well and grammatically well but not well with comprehension. This is why I struggle a lot in my past English classes. I enjoy reading in my English classes but when it came to writing an essay or a summary that was where I had problems. How can I know my learning style if I struggle with memory? That is my question so like I was saying I remember things when I read them and if it is in picture demonstration but I can't remember them later. How do I know my learning and memory style if my IQ is 79, my frontal lobe is partially damaged, and I struggle with abstract thinking. But I am good at telling others about an autobiography/biography story that I read just not in detail but the general story.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1833, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I have a question about memory and learning style?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/kqojz7/i_have_a_question_about_memory_and_learning_style/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HorrorSubstance", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_wfcxxhx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1609637871, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/kpaqrq/what_is_wrong_with_me/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kpaqrq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/kpaqrq/what_is_wrong_with_me/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1609637882, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have had several jobs from the age 18 - 22.

I just recently found out that she only had an up to a middle school education because when she was younger her mother died of breast cancer and her father was crippled with alcoholism. She was forced by life to start taking care of herself early.\n\nShe met my dad and got married young. Then she and my father moved to America with a hope for a better future. Unfortunately, they also had many obstacles to overcome. The didn't have much money to keep a good standard of living for a growing family, English was not their first language, they could only afford to live in dangerous neighborhoods, and they had so many more issues that put strains on their marriage. Later, after many years, and having had 7 children, my dad left. He completely abandoned my mother, who raised us on her own, in a foreign country. \n\nShe barley was able to make ends meet. Her time was consumed with work. She could not spread herself any thinner to give us anything more than bare bone essentials. She did not have time to raise me properly and she didn't really understand what learning disabilities are or what their effects are. If anything, she just thought of me as very stubborn, lazy, and a difficult/bad kid.\n\nWhen I was placed in reading resource classes at 8 years old I didn't really understand why I was in those classes but I did know that I was different from the rest of the kids in my grade. Then as I got older I became aware that I was being labeled \"dumb\" in the eyes of society from the way my middle school teachers, and then the kids, at school began to treat me. Some teachers treated me condescendingly and were patronizing. Other teachers were openly cruel. In the 6th grade, I decided that I no longer wanted to be treated differently so I put every bit of determination in to get out of the reading learning group. \n\nI felt like I was the only person at school and at home who believed in my potential.\n\nI worked hard to leave resource classes. I even managed to get into honors English and AP classes in high school. Then I got into university and completed my degree unassisted in four years. \n\nI did truly struggled to keep high grades the whole way but I never believed it had anything to do with the biological makeup of my brain. I always believed that maybe I wasn't working hard enough even though I spent hours struggling to memorize information, studying and practicing material. \n\nBack then I didn't realize how much time and effort I was putting in because I was an introvert and I didn't have much else going on in life. Now as an adult I have come to realize that there must be something concerningly wrong with me. Something more.  \n\nAs an adult in the workforce I cannot keep up with the fast pace demands and constant changes my job requires. It's harder to learn now than when I was in school. I even find it challenging being able balance work and  having any life outside from that.\n\nNow at 28 I realized that I missed up. \n\nI never didn't learn to manage my brain properly.  \n\nEarlier this year I started taking medication to help me cope with anxiety.\n\nAnd just recently, after doing some googling, I discovered that my issues may be due poorly treated learning disabilities coupled with undiagnosed  ADHD. \n\nI have made an appointment with a medical professional to finally be able to figure out why and how I am the way I am. I write this with tears in my eyes because in the back of my mind I still feel \"dumb\". I feel like an imposter. I hope I can come to cope with the feeling of shame, inadequacy, embarrassment, and guilt the adults in my life made me feel when I was young and that still I carry with me today.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1815, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Lasting Effects of having a LD and Growing Up Poor", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/kkkyki/the_lasting_effects_of_having_a_ld_and_growing_up/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "thirdyearpsych", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4hfk4hxy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1608649065, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/ki6v7n/research_recruitment_experiences_of_university/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ki6v7n", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/ki6v7n/research_recruitment_experiences_of_university/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1608649076, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi there, I\u2019m in my final year of my psychology degree &amp; need to recruit a few people for my dissertation &amp; would really appreciate help from anyone who can give it :)\n\nMy research is about university students with dyslexia and their experiences.\n\nI need a maximum of 10 participants &amp; would prefer as diverse a range of ages, genders and backgrounds as possible, so please share this with anyone you know that might be interested!\n\nParticipants will need to take part in one interview (done via skype/zoom/teams etc) lasting no longer than an hour.

I have C-PTSD from childhood abuse and was recently diagnosed with combined-type ADHD by a psychiatrist. I'm in therapy for the C-PTSD. I'm a smart person and I've been very successful in school as an adult, I'm doing a PhD in History now but I dropped out of high school in the first year and went back to school on my own when I was 21. I'm 31 now. \n\nI'll start with the problem of getting lost. I seriously struggle with directional information, to the point that the thought of looking around me while outside, to try to figure out or explain where I am, makes me feel nauseous. I don't seem to have any sense of direction, and I can't keep up with transportation systems like busses and trains. I get on the wrong bus/train very regularly, even going to and from places I frequent on an almost daily basis. I've been this way my entire life,  but since moving from a small town to a big city, it's become much more disabling. It is to a point that I am often afraid to leave the house to do simple things like go to the convenience store down the street because of the very real possibility of getting lost. I moved to a new neighbourhood about three months ago, and despite people having walked with me from one end of the street to the other many times, and knowing that there are major areas there, I struggle to remember it. I can remember one now,  tentatively, the other I cannot. I can walk down a street multiple times and seemingly have no memory of ever having been there. Often I will spot a shop or something else I remember and suddenly be surprised, because I thought I was in an entirely new place. \n\nI'm back in my home town for the holidays, where I've lived almost my entire life, and even here it is a struggle. My girlfriend drove with me to a new shopping center today and...she had to tell me it was new. It looked exactly the same to me as the two other shopping centres that I've been to countless times. I could not tell the difference. We're in another new place now (so I moved into a new place in the city, and we also moved into a new place in my hometown, I travel back and forth), and it took me about a week and a half or so to remember where all the rooms in the house were. There are some things I still struggle to remember, like there are two doors to enter the room where I game a lot downstairs, and I am still surprised whenever someone comes in the door I don't use, because I forget it's there. \n\nI don't forget absolutely everything, like my town is very small and the areas that I have walked through for several decades, I remember well. I could probably map out much of the downtown area,  but I think that's because I have so many memories there. I can connect almost everything to a foundational childhood memory, and I feel very safe here. \n\nI have other pretty serious memory problems as well,  which could be explained by ADHD, but feel connected to \"getting lost.\" I lose my things many times a day. I frequently put something down and have no idea where I put it seconds later. I get up to do something and completely forget about it. I struggle with screens even though I've spent hours of my day using computers and smart phones since I was nine years old. I can type extremely fast but I struggle to remember where the apps that I use multiple times a day are, like my email and browser. Same with smart TVs, I have to work hard and focus to figure out how to navigate from one function to the other (switch from TV to HDMI input for gaming console, for example).\n\nI forget important things all the time, like I suddenly remembered about ten minutes ago that I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning. If my work schedule changes, even though I am now extremely vigilant about keeping track of it, chances are very high that I will get things mixed up and not be where I'm supposed to be. Even the classes I teach at the same time four times a week,  I have to set alarms for, or I may forget them. I had to remind myself several times today that it's a Sunday. \n\nAlso probably related, I can't do math. I started failing it by the second grade and never recovered it.  I highly doubt I would have succeeded in university if there was a mandatory math component (ironic, since my mother was a math teacher). I struggle with numbers a lot. I got a literal and actual 100% on the qualitative (writing and reading comprehension) portion of the GRE and almost a zero on the math. \n\nMy therapist is trauma-focused and suspects that it's the result of dissociation, that I get overwhelmed and simply do not take in a lot of information about my surroundings, but we have a lot of work to do before starting to dig into it, and I'm just trying to find answers where I can.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1796, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I get lost everywhere.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/kcscw8/i_get_lost_everywhere/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Realrex", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_z04pi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1607875537, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/kcd2x5/help_finding_form/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kcd2x5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/kcd2x5/help_finding_form/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1607875547, "score": 1, "selftext": "Long story short, I have a learning disability, but between my mom and my forgetfulness I don't know what it is.

I have been told by the website that this survey is fully accessible, however if you encounter issues please let me know.\n\nAdditionally, if anyone would be interested in discussing this topic further, I am still carrying out interviews and would be very grateful for your contributions. I am looking to speak to people with all types of disabilities, although I am currently particularly low on responses from women. This interview can take place by Zoom, Skype, telephone or a text-based over an Instant messaging platform. If you would be interested in taking part, please leave a comment or send me a direct message (please note interviewees need to be aged 18+).\n\nThank you so much, if you have any questions please

seems like a candidate for a learning disability, but I can't think of what it is.\n\nI used to live with my uncle, this kid's father, during my college (or Uni, in the Commonwealth lexicon) years (about 10-12 years ago) since his house was near my school. I just met him again for the first time in a couple years due to COVID and was shocked at how he was struggling with minor life milestones.\n\nIt has to be a very general behavioral disability because I used to help tutor him when I lived with him. He didn't have a problem understanding things when broken down for him. It manifest as a motivation problem but is too broad to be simple laziness. \n\nHe's 19 and can't even pass the written portion of the driving test for his learning permit. I remember him being really excited for a youth soccer league. So I offered to help him train soccer skills. After about 5-10 minutes, his attitude shifted to \"this is hard, I'm going to go play video games\". He is taking a half course load at a community college and did not pass a single class. He is not into art or music according to his sister. He's in danger of becoming a NEET or falling into a dead-end type job.\n\nMy sister-in-law is a psychiatrist and brought up the possibility of a learning disability.

My Croatian language teacher( I am Croatian) simply said that I just need to work harder because everybody could start asking for special treatment if we start doing that.  \n\n\nShe was 62 years old and my country generally isn't most advanced in the world.  \n\n\nI struggled with Croatian and Math the most.  \n\n\nI long time suspected for ADHD and dysgraphia and after talking to number of psychologists/psychiatrists without any real help I finally got diagnosed with both Dysgraphia   \nand ADHD at age of 26.  \n\n\nI was relieved but also very bitter.  \n\n\nSurprisingly I am way more bitter about dysgraphia and effect it had on me.  \n\n\nFor my ADHD symptoms as I child I thought \"Nah I'm good, I'm just scattered brained, I just need to focus.\"  \n\n\nDyspgrahia really wrecked my self-esteem and made me think something is wrong with me.  \nI think a lot of mild/moderate depression/anxiety my therapists pointed out was due to untreated dysgraphia. Example:  \n\n\n For at least a dozen of times me and my father had a deal that I would greatly focus on my handwriting in next couple of months and start to write \"normal\".  \n\n\nSpoiler alert. There was no improvement.   \nAnd my father yelled at me and told me I am lying to him how hard I tried and that I actually didn't try at all.  \nIt really made me feel like an idiot. 12,13 year old writing like 7 year old, trying hard as hell on my handwriting with no results whatsoever while my classmates effortlessly wrote with no problem whatsoever.  \n\n\nI was ridiculed by my classmates,family even teachers.  \n\n\nStill being a fan of therapy I just never felt my therapists understood what is bothering me so much.  \nI got vibe from them like, \"You have bad handwriting and your school was bit more difficult. It was long time ago no point of ruminating over it.\"  \n\n\nAnd I completely agree that only thing I can do is to move on.  \n\n\nBut getting dysgraphia confirmed at adult age did wonders to my self esteem.  \nI now know what was \"wrong\" with me. I knew something was wrong with me.  \nIt wasn't like all authority figures said whole my life. That I am just lazy,careless and sluggish.  \n\n\nI also hate the fact that nobody told me. Especially my parents.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n My therapist explained that in my city in the early 2000s learning disabilities were poorly understood, especially dysgrpahia and that my parents and teachers did the best they could.  \n\n\nStill I feel nobody understood how hard is to have dyspgrahia growing up and writing for couple of hours everyday and not knowing why you struggle so much.  \nI kinda feel everybody I spoke to about recently about dysgraphia (expect learning difficulties specialist who diagnosed me) doesn't think it was that big of a deal.  \n\n\nI would love to hear you guys what do you think of my situation.  \n\n\nI know it is very common in our community.  \n\n\nI would also love to hear from guys who had similar difficulties and how do they feel about everything.

I have a reading disorder and probably as a consequence of that I despise reading books. I usually listen to audiobooks when I have to read a book and I plan on doing so in college. However, I can never take good notes unless I am looking at the material, so I have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to actually read books. That brings me to my question: Does anyone have any tips or tricks they use to stay focused on reading (I tend to find any excuse to not read) or make it less torturous?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 2269, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Reading Books in College", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/ozlrvo/reading_books_in_college/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "oldsoftshoe", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bj7jso8y", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1628305735, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/ozlhrr/recently_ive_been_reading_words_wrongseeing_words/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ozlhrr", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/ozlhrr/recently_ive_been_reading_words_wrongseeing_words/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1628305745, "score": 1, "selftext": "Often the words I misread are, I realize later, actually words I\u2019m thinking in my head, concurrently as I\u2019m reading, or words I hear someone say in the background.

It upsets me a lot, because I feel like I'm not doing a good enough job as a father. If a pipe bursts and I can't afford a plumber I should be able I fix it, because I'm supposed to protect them. My wife and son say I'm a great dad who shouldn't worry about that, and I try to remind myself of that, but at the same time it hurts because I feel like there isn't anything special about me and I want my son to learn as much as possible.\n\n I feel like when I try to learn mechanical skills like trying to fix things I feel this tense pressure in my head like I'm getting overwhelmed,  and if I think I'm doing it right I look back from a distance and see it's horrible wrong.

I hope you are having a nice weekend. I am wondering if anyone has any learning preferences to study without a computer screen or learn specific subjects by drawing their own diagrams?\n\nI have a system that works for my learning needs and have been formerly identified over 20 years ago which I feel very lucky because it was quite accurate and I took my education as far as becoming a Professional Educator and have the role I wished for. My issue is sometimes I feel very stubborn because studying from youtube videos seem so unnatural. Most of the processing deficits are visually and sometimes orally. I consider myself a better learner from hearing information and I am finding myself very interested in technology but it is just sort of boring to navigate the visuals. Does anyone relate to this?\n\nFor example, I had to review a subject in math in order to be tested and while the videos were great on youtube, I do not make sense of it unless I myself copy and fill it out completely on my own. So I will use three different coloured pens, remind myself for the steps as a memory aid, it is all great and I love colour coding but when it comes to studying, I feel so stubborn and inflexible sometimes.\n\nDo you relate? My main diagnosis is a physical limitation with one arm so I tend to get bored when typing rather than writing things by hand.

I also cannot understand things right away when teachers explain things to me. However, I learn with so much clarity when I am by myself (YouTube videos).

"pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1624097369, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI just wanted to say that if you or someone you know has a learning disability it really is not the end and don\u2019t give up on them. Push them every time they fail. \n\nI just finished my 4 year degree, a bachelors of science in visual communication design with a marketing minor  at a 3.8 GPA. \n\nHow did I do this? Well I had a lot of people who supported me.\n\nDiagnosed with high functioning autism, processing speed learning disabilities, adhd, anxiety and depression when I was 7. \n\nI had a 1-1 assistant and IEP my entire primary school career 1st-12th grade and barely made it to graduation after a 6 month stint on home and hospital from depression(I had a cruel English teacher). \n\nI moved a couple towns over to a community college and dabbled in various majors for about 4 years(sign language to photography and print making to computer science to finally web design). At that point I reached out to vocational rehab in my state known as California Department of Rehab(DOR). CA DOR paid for my schooling and a tutor and bought me computers, assistive tech and driving lessons so I could get my license. I worked my butt off showing up to labs and office hours when needed paying attention and taking things very seriously. 2 years later I got certificates in web design. 2 years after that I got my associates in Web after a brutal anthropology lab and a stats teacher who was one of the most disengaged and unconcerned teacher I\u2019ve ever met. And 8 months later I found out I had enough units for another degree in infographics design as a result from taking so many classes in print making and visual arts. \n\nIn Fall 2018 I applied and was accepted to San Francisco State. The DPRC there set me up with 2x testing time and I made sure to take full advantage of teacher office hours and tutoring offered by the school as much as possible. The DOR would pay for my school supplies and any odd requirements I had for design school like red markers or special xacto blades.  What also helped for me was getting pdf files of the books for classes and listening to them on text to speech(aloud reader app on Android). The school even had an in house shop where they could chop up books and make a pdf for me if the publisher wouldn\u2019t give them a copy. \n\nThen the pandemic hit and after only 3 and a half semesters in person I had to take all my classes at home an hour away from campus by BART. It was a dream come true at first but eventually was horrifying to basically teach myself how to do everything with only some video instruction and a web page for the class to prompt me. But I made it through and I\u2019m glad that I stuck it out. \n\nHow did going through this as a person with disabilities change my attitude? Well for one thing you learn to not take \u201cno\u201d for an answer and find intuitive ways to be successful like befriending classmates who are doing well or seeking out other resources or help online. Advocating for your needs is also extremely imperative and important because this world is not designed for the disabled. Developing support networks with other students to do group work and be less alone during the pandemic for example also helped. \n\nMy advice would be to not give up ever if you want to learn a professional trade or skill in a college program no matter what. Don\u2019t listen to the voice in your head doubting yourself because I had many classmates with no disabilities who were as smart as a rock. You would be really surprised by how many people are just there to barely make it for no particular reason. Meanwhile I almost always got an \u201cA\u201d because I knew I could not afford to do poorly because the world already expected that from me from the beginning. \n\nSo anyways I hope this will encourage someone and let them know that it takes time to get there but you are capable. I was in college from age 19 to 30 but I did it and it enriched me and gave me amazing tools that help me in my perspective and dealing with all kinds of life challenges. And if you are where I was when I was 19 or even 7 sitting in a classroom crying because reading a book was so mentally exhausting due to a disability I\u2019m thinking of you and know you can do this and you will.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 2190, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Encouragement for those with learning disabilities", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/o3b6w2/encouragement_for_those_with_learning_disabilities/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Sighooh", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5yvjcyil", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1623877992, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/o1fojc/what_is_an_adult_assessment_like_and_do_you_think/", "gildings": {}, "id": "o1fojc", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/o1fojc/what_is_an_adult_assessment_like_and_do_you_think/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1623899460, "score": 1, "selftext": "Debating if I should shell out the $3000 dollars to get an assessment and possibly some sort of diagnosis.

For example, If I\u2019m going to be dating somebody, I\u2019m gonna have to tell them about my disability sooner or later, because I obviously can\u2019t hide it forever. This applies to employment as well, I\u2019m afraid that if I choose to disclose during the job interview they won\u2019t hire me or they will pay me less because whether we like it or not, whether it\u2019s illegal or not, a lot of employers view us as liability\u2019s, because this world wasn\u2019t built for us. On the flip side if I choose not to disclose and let\u2019s say I screw up on the job I\u2019ll be fired on the spot or I won\u2019t be given any kind of empathy or accommodations, what should I do? \nAlso, sorry if this post was a mess to read.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 2171, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "(Advice) Employment and potential job/hiring discrimination", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/nxsy1h/advice_employment_and_potential_jobhiring/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "EMTVV", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bh5iaijx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1623386937, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/nx7mb8/how_do_i_address_learning_disabilities/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nx7mb8", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/nx7mb8/how_do_i_address_learning_disabilities/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1623388112, "score": 1, "selftext": "What kind of doctor do you go to to address learning disabilities to get help for?

I want to preface this with I have never had any trouble with reading words as they are written, spelling, or writing. I haven\u2019t noticed obvious difficulties understanding spoken words either. \n\nBasically my problem is with processing the information after I have read/accurately heard it. Individually I understand what is being said but sometimes my brain can\u2019t make sense of things as a whole. I can\u2019t understand card games or board games for the life of me (no matter how simple) to the point where it\u2019s a running joke in my group of friends..it just does not happen no matter how hard I try. I have trouble with a lot of video games too. \n\nI have trouble following stories people tell me (usually through through text, sometimes verbally) about situations that have a lot of moving parts. Basically people have to explain things to me.....a lot. Science and math were impossible to me, no matter how hard I studied. I\u2019m very slow with visually counting things and even the smallest mental math problems just do not happen (like counting 2,4,8 etc).\n\nI recently quit my office job after graduation (I\u2019m 25) because I struggled so much I constantly had to work overtime. I felt so inadequate next to the other entry level person who was very obviously not struggling as much as I was\u2014the comparison was lovely.\n\nMy mental health took such a scary turn that I had to quit and move back home to take a job at a grocery store. I cannot tell you how much happier I am to be bagging grocerie because I feel like I can fully understand this job.\n\nI\u2019m just now realizing after graduating that I may have roughly figured out how to navigate the academic world with these difficulties, but the office job world with their same-day deadlines and worship of quick learners is a whole new opponent that just decked me straight in the face. \n\nI know that a lot of this stuff can fall under ADHD symptoms, but sometimes I feel like I have information processing difficulties on top of that.

I usually take a bit longer than most to learn the rules, and it causes me embarrassment when trying to learn a new game. It sucks because I\u2019d love to attend local meetups at board game cafes. I have dyscalculia and dysgraphia, as well as NVLD. \n\nAs a kid, I didn\u2019t fully understand regular Monopoly (not kid\u2019s Monopoly). My parents didn\u2019t mock me for this, they just modified the game so that I could feel comfortable playing it. Now, as an adult, I still struggle to understand the rules of board games - they just have so many damn rules, and my working memory is shit. \n\nCard games are beyond me. Never got around to understanding trading card game rules like Pok\u00e9mon or Yugioh, and I was ostracized from my old friends due to this. As an adult, I have to come to terms with the fact that I likely will never be able to play card games like Poker. \n\nShuffling cards properly is near impossible for me also, due to my poor motor skills. I can technically shuffle cards, but it is not proper form AT ALL and is inefficient. \n\nI just had to rant. I used to love board games, but with age I\u2019ve gained a painful amount of self-awareness regarding my disabilities.

For every interest that I have. I know I will never have a chance at accomplishing it because I am a defect. I am currently interested in economics and have been reading all about it. But lpd makes learning everything that is related to language difficult. I can only absorb limited amounts of information at an extremely slow pace and it is even harder for me to express it in proper words that make logical sense. It is a death sentence for anyone who cannot process language in the 21st century when society places values communication over almost everything else. Add a mild speech disability and aspergers, life is pretty much over for me.\n\nWith learning disabilities, I could never hope to compete with a normal person in academia or in the work force. Hard work means nothing. An equally hard working normal person can easily breeze through anything that I struggle with and the world has plenty of normal people waiting in line for the job. There is no way that even the government force corporations to hire me when I can't perform the job. All the inclusiveness and diversity reform doesn't work on people with learning disabilities. I would love to work in academia researching economics but I probably won't get it unless the university lowers it standard in examinations for me to get a proper degree. It wouldn't never happen though. \n\nI also have a mild physical condition and chronic illness that prevents me from doing any exhaustive physical work. What a life right? At least with such a defective body, I don't fear death. If the world do collapse from economic depression/global warming in the future, suicide would really be the perfect way to go.

Can't afford to otherwise.\n\nHas anyone had the experience that accommodations are largely lacking? In my previous school I had none except a quiet room to take tests in, which didn't mitigate the anxiety of tests on 120 pgs of biology notes.\n\nSo to have some is somewhat comforting. But I realize, if I have say an autistic burnout, they are comfortable excusing me but they will not at all refund the tuition. \n\nI had the same experience in 2012. I was accepted into the Culinary Institute of America, the CIA, which is supposedly the best culinary school in the world.\n\nThey had no accommodations for people with a disability. They told me outright only one student to their knowledge had ever come there being on the spectrum. \n\nWhen I found that I was starving, due to my autistic diet, I was forced to pick up a job that I had to walk multiple miles to back and forth each day. I ended up not getting sleep for multiple months in a row, and eventually I became unable to do much other than stare at the wall for days. \n\nThey sent me home 30,000 dollars in debt, to begin again working jobs that paid 8 an hr. I was so paralyzed by my failure I was unable to do anything but walk my dog up and down the street for months. When I started work again about a year later, I found that I had lost the ability to speak.\n\nI would stutter, and misplace words, and the chef would make fun of me for going to culinary school just to be a dishwasher.\n\n8 years later and I worry that the same reality may repeat itself.\n\nThe school is happy to take my money, but I'm this sort of exotified experiment more or less, where if I do succeed, I'm glamourized for doing in spite of, and if I fail, I only affirm what they suspect.\n\nSo at this point I'm wondering if anyone has any advice? I don't have anyone that deals with these issues specifically. \n\nI reached out to autism speaks. They sent me largely useless information. A lot of it. That was a bit amazing actually. That people have so much useless information ready to go. They sent me to a job site that was supposedly an autism career site but the only job for me was the military and dying for this country... well I'm not a fan of irony.

"score": 1, "selftext": "I know i have Dyslexia, but over the last couple months I have been reading a bit about ADHD/ADD and Bi-polar and depression. I've never related to anything more than what read so far. I believe i relate more to the inattentive variety but I get spurs of hyperactivity which is cringy and I know i can become unbearable, but this does mentally burn me out. \n\nI do want to try and get tested or examined one day, but for now I wanted to see if these \"symptons\" are related and if anyone could help with coping with these for now. The main reason is I (currently) want to do a distant learning degree but theres no chance atm.. \n\nMental fogs - I have experienced this my whole life, i remember as a kid being asked what i think about something and not a thing going on in my head, just a foggy white noise type feeling. It happens while I am trying to think, explain or remember something alot. \n\nShort/long term memory recall - I could be told to do something at work and then instantly forget the important aspect of the task. Also when trying to remember something from the past, I can visualise parts of the memory but putting it into words just induces the mental fogs. \n\nTasks/procrastination - I get distracted and can lose interest in anything very fast, but it is also very difficult for me to get into any tasks. I'll literally do anything but the task sometimes. For example; I wanted to go for a run the other day, and I had a burning question popped in my head (which I needed to know the answer too) \"Correct running technique\", after that I had so many other questions relating to running, breathing and excercise which i was researching and by the time i finished, it was midnight. Then I lost interest in running altogether... \n\nHyperfocus - There are times which i get so interested in something, I could focus for hours on it, but I also tend to overthink and burn myself out as it can get overbearing, I get flooded with questions and ideas and it is impossible for me to process. When I do try and structure my thoughts and write them down Mr procrastination pops along and I lose all that focus. \n\nShortterm memory - I forgot I already wrote this, but leaving it in for some reason. \n\nDepression? - When I'm unstimulated, I get really low in mood. It can come out of nowhere and it can hit hard. It can also come after burning out from being more hyperactive or after the frustration of the effects of the other \"symptons i put down\".. This one is effecting me the most these days and is in a cycle as the depressing feelings is making me more unstimulated. \n\nAnxiety - I think all my social anxiety stems from the difficulty I have explaining stuff, it effects my work (I work on maintaining aircraft so it is important to explain whats wrong lol). My social life, as I feel like I cannot be there for people or make meaningfull friendships if i cant concentrate or think when the need me.. \n\nThanks for anyhelp if anyone does lol, and for any speeling. or grammatically errors, \n\nor\u00a0\u00a0 formatting \nerrors\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1768, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Dyslexic and (potential adhd) - how do you cope?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/k2e0fy/dyslexic_and_potential_adhd_how_do_you_cope/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Memory-Research", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8ymw8gep", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606503045, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/k274a8/accessible_banking_questionnaire/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k274a8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/k274a8/accessible_banking_questionnaire/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "EjD6gSXCgJABQfGoBNpOi9EgCSy2-oKyJDLVz2TabYg", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/cx3cohI4rXC4LDXUZiN6idKSNzxFEOrJ9KFnWoB7TuI.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c97ce9f6bd609cbfeb8d46abccaf118f20807d4", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/cx3cohI4rXC4LDXUZiN6idKSNzxFEOrJ9KFnWoB7TuI.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42c89637a78cfdbaf03a8a900d7f430b86d50681", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/cx3cohI4rXC4LDXUZiN6idKSNzxFEOrJ9KFnWoB7TuI.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5df99a1ae4a70be65f9d14d7fa537b1361176575", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/cx3cohI4rXC4LDXUZiN6idKSNzxFEOrJ9KFnWoB7TuI.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c930116a1638d4cbac2b1eeef3e4231e1c2f73a", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/cx3cohI4rXC4LDXUZiN6idKSNzxFEOrJ9KFnWoB7TuI.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=298ed13026ff3254357418d187021e6dacd9cc89", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/cx3cohI4rXC4LDXUZiN6idKSNzxFEOrJ9KFnWoB7TuI.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d70890742121a5ff69bfc074ae12d3430bac9a20", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/cx3cohI4rXC4LDXUZiN6idKSNzxFEOrJ9KFnWoB7TuI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=195f6390a06e5b045716ff495ed481fa952c4814", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1606503056, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nWe are conducting research on how invisible disabilities, more specifically memory-related, affect the banking experience of individuals of all ages.

I was trying to be confident but I turned out to be annoying and that people made dislike me ever more. I had poor social anxiety so I was quiet and reserved and craved social acceptance. I dreamed of getting girls and be liked by everyone cause I felt like an outcast. No one respected me even my friends picked on me and always made me the odd one out.\n- even my cousins thought i was weird and didn't appreciate me either.\nIn school, i was a bad student, i flunked 4th grade and got a lot of Cs and Ds but now i get normal and better grades. I first spoke as an infant when i was 4 or 5.\n- I'm not good with handling confrontation, i fight with my sister a lot because she always thinks she's right and I get mad easily but we still love each other. But I'm not glad with confrontation and defending myself. I always laugh or smirk when someone makes fun of me and I don't know why.\n- I had a very weird relationship with sexuality. I remember when I was very young I saw a episode of Spongebob and I was \"turned on\" and I was a very sexual kid and still am. I thought about sex a lot like in third grade. I'm older now and I have a more mature thinking about it but I always thought about sex from time to time. I'm a teenage boy now so I don't want to go any further lol.

I'm currently carrying out a postgraduate research project into disabled people's experiences using YouTube. This includes accessing and navigating the platform, the type of content you interact with, what you may like about the site and what you may dislike. You can be someone who just uses YouTube every now and then, or a creator who posts videos often. I am looking to hear the views of all types of users! (Please note, you do not need to disclose your disability or health information!)\n\nIt would be amazing if some of you would be interested in taking part in a short interview with me where I ask your opinions about the platform. It will be informal and not too long! This can take part on Zoom, Teams, by telephone, an instant messaging text-based interview, or an alternative depending on your access needs.

Just waiting for an opportunity to get an actual therapist so usually I don't mention it and instead say \"executive disorder\" even in the subreddit, but I swear the context of it will make sense), but if there's one thing I can't relate to, it's the need to gain new information. I really want to learn, and I enjoy it, but I can't seem to grasp learning sometimes, and it's to the point it's demotivating at times and I end up being in an awkward position where I want to learn it, but I can't and it's tiring to. I'm always taking more time to learn new things more than it is necessary, and the only time I was able to grasp a concept was with my Marine Bio teacher who would break the information down so that even a child or a middle schooler at most could understand what he was saying, and he would often summarize what we already learned everyday before giving us new information so we could be reminded of everything in a few minutes, making me very familiar with the information and being able to catch up with everyone else even when it came to difficult topics. But every other class I had to familiarize myself for months if not years on the same topic to actually be able to understand things most people understood in minutes.\n\nI honestly can't tell if I'm just a slow learner or not. It's kind of weird cause I don't mix any words or phrases up, nor do I have trouble with numbers beyond basic elementary stuff. I always thought of myself as just dumb, or I just suck at what I'm doing, but then I kind of realize I do this with everything I learn. People say I just have a different learning style but like, when I look at the types of learning styles I feel like I'm simultaneously all and none of them. Nothing works for me to actually learn like everyone else so I need to use all of them or else I can't absorb the information. And that's time consuming. And exhausting. And it makes me feel like I suck at everything cause people can get things instantly that I know I probably can understand, but not unless I put all my effort and still only learn the surface level stuff. It's embarrassing. \n\nI sometimes wonder how I'll survive in the world, knowing everyone has more potential than I would ever have. It makes me jealous of fake potential in a way I shouldn't be because fake potential is also dangerous, but god I want someone to actually give me an example of when I can actually be someone.",

I was diagnosed with ADD/ADHA as a preteen and was on Ritalin until was probably 16 but most likely still have it as an adult but when I started college I noticed something.\n\nMath. In general I can do simple math, even geometry but anything else cannot be retained. I noticed the trouble when I was learning my times table and division but it was never addressed. I went to ESL a lot as a kid and costed through high school because I was a polite, quiet, and good student. \n\nSo of course this has affected my college degree. Unfortunately Algebra is a requirement even in a fine arts degree, and despite being told I need it in my life, I really don\u2019t. My brain can\u2019t retain all the different ways to solve all the different equations, and if I remember one I\u2019ll forget it within a few days or combine two different ones. Of course if I had examples of solved equations I could do it. \n\nIts a lot more complicated than that but thats the gist. I also can\u2019t dance to save my life, pick up the wrong rhythm, and even though I played the violin for almost ten years I can\u2019t sight read a rhythm for the life of me. I don\u2019t drive and even get lost on routes I go on daily.\n\nI\u2019ve looked into math disabilities before but never really found answers. I think its a combination of ADHD and a learning disability but have no clue how to even approach it.\n\nDoes anyone have similar issues?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1733, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Possible learning disability?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/jufmr7/possible_learning_disability/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "JG34579", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7io8dhjk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605410618, "domain": "self.LearningDisabilities", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/juf513/still_feel_like_i_cannot_function/", "gildings": {}, "id": "juf513", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/juf513/still_feel_like_i_cannot_function/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1605410629, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI have been struggling my entire life with either severe ADD or some type of learning disability.

I struggled my whole life with learning disabilities not being able to read well past the age of five and not being able to do small math equations.  My mother did everything she could but what I want to display in this book is help for parents and children because I had a lot of my disabilities hidden from adults so that I could go outside and have fun with friends and not be stuck inside with tutors or going to special classes or things like that so I became very resourceful which is helped me but it has also hindered me as I\u2019ve entered the workforce and it did hinder me in high school as well in college and I\u2019m interested in finding a agent or editor does anyone have any good recommendations based on the kind of book I\u2019m talking about?\n\nSample\nChapter 4\n4th \u2013 6th grade \u2013 Moving Schools\n \nMany of those surrounding me were picking up on my learning differences, and my mom was making them take notice (thank you mom)\n \nI started Charles Armstrong in the 4th grade. I was THILLED! My bullies wouldn\u2019t be there, my brother wouldn\u2019t we there, and I was allowed the ride the train with the other kids heading to the same school for the first time. My mom told me this this could really help me, it was pretty far away, but I\u2019d get to ride a train with other kids, had nicer kids, more like me, more reserved, took a while to open up, and I would love it. I was so happy. So, she added me to the summer camp, I was the only girl out of 10 boys and I loved it! Not because I was the only girl, but there was not a single bully in sight, it was one of the best summers of my life. I was learning how to read using the Slingerland method.\n \n\u201cSlingerland is a structured, sequential, simultaneous, multisensory teaching approach is designed to help dyslexic students and other struggling readers with speaking, reading, writing and spelling. The flexibility of the approach has also made it effective in general education classrooms as well.\u201d \u2013 Slingerland.com\n \nFinally 4th grade begins and I am so excited. I dressed how I wanted to, I had my backpack ready, I couldn\u2019t wait! As I walked in the beautiful classroom, I see all these kids milling around the front of the class.  Excitedly I walk over, and we have. Pet classroom bunny! I love bunnies. I love all animals. I cried when my mom had to put a tree down. This was a DREAM come true. Was this school heaven? No bullies, bunnies, friends. Well as you can imagine this didn\u2019t last long. Suddenly every day I was coming home really, really sick, stuffed up, asthma, itchy eyes, sore throat. We waited it out to see if maybe I had a cold, but I would feel better on the weekends but much worse on the way home from school and at school. We realized that I was allergic to the class Bunny who was the sweetest Bunny but he wasn't caged he was free roaming and would roam around the classroom where you could pet him and cuddle him and of course his dander was everywhere and that was sort of affecting my health. I didn't care because I was only a child and I didn't want the Bunny to get taken away from the other kids even though I was struggling but my mom talked with the teacher and explained to her that she can't have her child coming home sick every day when I really need to be engaged in learning. While my mom did the right thing, the teacher did not and pointed me out as the one who had to have the rabbit removed and the rabbit would be lonely all-day watching TV because I had an allergy. You can imagine the looks I got from my fellow students. This passed and for the most part school went smoothly.  I was learning how to read using that new method, I was spending all my time in the bookstore reading as many books as I could I could not check out enough books I loved reading so much I would stay up late at night under the covers with a flashlight reading just thinking about all the things I had missed. Charles Armstrong did an amazing job teaching me in a different way and understanding me in a different way. Reading now comes just so naturally to me I barely even remember the Slingerland method it is so engrained in me. It opened up new worlds for me and I could not be more thankful.\n \nThe only thing that lacked was math and that is where I really still struggle today, but that will pop up soon I promise, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hide it forever.  \n \nTips:\n\u00b7      I know it\u2019s hard when you\u2019re already having to go to tutoring sessions outside of school and sessions in school and you're stressed out all the time and homework is taking forever and usually involves fights and tears with our loved ones. But I really recommend as early as you can finding someone who can help you with math if you struggle with it. I have what I believe Dyscalculia and I knew I was having trouble with math for my whole life but I just had no more time to put in as a kid to share this with an adult (I wanted to spend time with my toys and friends) and I didn't want to disappoint another adult Or see the look of disappointment at how I wasn't understanding no matter how many times they explained it\n\u00b7      Express your free to your loved ones, maybe make a deal that you only have to attend twice a week and at first and see how it goes. Give them some choices in them process\n\u00b7      If you do put your child in a special program like Kumon for instance make sure that you are there to watch what they're doing because there were often times I would use a calculator or I remember having to do Kumon in Hawaii and I cheated using the calculator upstairs because all I wanted to do was get down to the beach and this did me no favors and was a waste of my mom's money. And I was never ever prepared for the next week.\n\u00b7      A private math teacher or 1:1 center may be best, because kids on want to have fun, they don\u2019t realize the repercussions ow what not applying themselves costs them. I don\u2019t recommend math take home homework, it\u2019s way to easy to cheat.\n\u00b7      Hug yourself, or your kids, they aren\u2019t cheating to be an A+ student, they are using a survival mechanism", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a 36-year-old female working in one of the top tech agencies.

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. About 2 weeks ago I was evaluated and tested to figure out what mental disorders I have, per my therapists request. I went into it not really thinking I would be given an IQ test, but I was. I got my results in the mail today, and it said my overall IQ score was 71. It also said I had the mental capacity of a 10 or 11 year old. I'm basically devastated, because I feel like this is all wrong. I excelled in school until 5th grade, even having one of the highest reading levels in my grade at one point. 5th-12th grade I just stopped caring though, due to personal issues, but I did graduate high school. I do have some reading and comprehension problems, but I don't think they're to the point that I'm intellectually disabled. I'm a functioning adult, I'm in my early 20s and happily married... No troubles with doing every day tasks... I just feel like a normal person. Could this all be wrong? I'm just so confused and hurt, and I don't know what to do.\n\nEdit: Thought I should add it was a writter IQ test, asking me synonyms between words, matching pieces to complete a bigger picture, and trying to complete patterns.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LearningDisabilities", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ysrh", "subreddit_subscribers": 1727, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Told I have an IQ of 71?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDisabilities/comments/jtnlp1/told_i_have_an_iq_of_71/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]
