I am now 15 years old. I go through spurts where it's not so bad, but then other times, I can throw up to 75 times or more a day (rough estimate). I had an endoscopy (the procedure where the scope goes down your throat; not sure what it's called) whenever I first started having issues, but that was eight years ago. I have tried both western and homeopathic methods. Western methods didn't really offer me many choices, so we went to homeopathic methods/doctors whenever I was about 11. It was also whenever I had a really, really bad period of rumination. I've also tried different things on my own, but nothing really seems to work or keep it away. The main problem with my case is that usually I swallow my throw up back down. I do this to keep from losing weight, but, in the meantime, it is really just straight-up ruining my esophagus. At times, it feels like my esophagus/throat area is literally burning. It also has led to a lot of breathing issues. I have had moments where I'm too dizzy to stand; of course, there are also plenty of times with massive constipation and diarrhea. I have heartburn and pressure on my chest. These are all the additional symptoms that I experience whenever my rumination is bad. All of these started a few years ago, but they keep getting worse and more frequent with time. In October of this year, we went to a different homeopathic doctor, and I was placed on three medicines, one as an antacid (anti-acid), one for anxiety, and one for something else (had to do with my rumination; just can't remember specifics). I went because all of the additional symptoms as well as the actual rumination came to a full-head. It just rampantly increased out of nowhere; I literally had trouble breathing for at least four days straight. It wasn't fun. The medicine has really worked, but now it's not. I'm throwing up a lot more again, and the burning sensation is starting to come back. I don't really know what to do from here. I think I'm going in soon for some tests; I think it's a blood test and a pee in the cup test. I was wondering what your guys' advice would be and if there's anything I can do on my own or at home. I've been dealing with this sucker for over half my life, but I'm still suffering with it. I don't really know what to do or what the next step is.

since I was a kid, I haven't faced any issues whatsoever related to stomach, digestion or throat like I stated, I'm a healthy guy in general, It usually happens when I eat too much and have enough water for the flow to be sutable to perform backflow, I can pretty much feel it in my stomach when I can perform it or not and yeah It's in MY true will to do it or not.. It NEVER accidently happened, not even once..\n\nI remember as a kid before going to school I would use this trick to fake \"vomiting\" my breakfast so I could skip school or re-eat sweets that I loved (I know it's disgusting but that's just the truth and I'm coming forward.) I didn't use this much since I didn't will to give out too much about my \"little secret\"I grew up doing this as an adult and never once questioned it but today when I used this for first time as a \"trick\" again since my childhood, I had to do the research. I have gym tommorow morning and I had chicken in the evening and dinner which is far too heavy meal for me to perform gym in the morning, So I did what I can, I threw up the \"extra\" food I had making my stomach feel empty again.\n\nConclusion: Even though I've been living by doing this for years, basically my whole life and doing it feels so normal as breathing, I am still concerned about what causes this and is this even something that people have found to be diagnosed with, Please help reddit.

I remember being hospitalized for being able to essentially vomit on command.\n\nAcid Reflux was my diagnosis....they gave me pills and sent me on my way for decades.\n\nAcid is 1 component of destruction when it comes to conditions like GERD or Rumination syndrome. Luckily for us our food is ruminated before it becomes very acidic in our stomaches, BUT there are other enzymes that damage your throat such as Pepsin and Bile.\n\nI know there is a temptation to ignore this issue. Just take some Prilosec and just drink some alcohol with the boys eat some Lemon candy, and start your day with a nice sugary coffee.\n\nDo not do this. Eat a low acid diet, stay away from all alcohol, chocolate, and caffeine.\n\nWhat happens if you don't? When your body ruminated, especially at night if you have a full stomach. The contents go not only into your throat but your Eustachian tubes as well which connect to your ears. This will cause over time not only nerve damage on your throat but Tinnitus.\n\nDoctors will be of no use once you develop either. Tinnitus nothing can be done and Nerve damage can only be treated with medication that just takes away the effects.\n\nSo not ignore this. I finally know what is going on with my body and it has taken years to figure out my diagnosis, but also my own research and bad moves to learn about where this road leads.\n\nThe good news? If you watch your diet, don't overeat, and stay away from acidic foods the damage from rumination can be quite minimal! If fact despite my throat issues my esophagus itself is in pretty good shape.\n\nTake care of yourself.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ruminationsyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_28y4i8", "subreddit_subscribers": 338, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do not ignore this Condition", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ruminationsyndrome/comments/qtnwl2/do_not_ignore_this_condition/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Lisacoates", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_81kwlgnq", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1636320922, "domain": "self.ruminationsyndrome", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ruminationsyndrome/comments/qoyf7z/burping_up_water_right_after_swallowing/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qoyf7z", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "c10fce66-5f4e-11eb-b502-0ea465762f43", "link_flair_text": "Does Anyone Else", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/ruminationsyndrome/comments/qoyf7z/burping_up_water_right_after_swallowing/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1636320933, "score": 1, "selftext": "Can you bring up stuff right after you swallow?

I'd like to add a trigger-warning since this isn't an easy thing to discuss - especially not for people with/recovering from an ED. If this is too hard to talk about, definitely feel free to skip this one.\n\nCutting to the chase - I've had RS for as long as I can remember. Growing up, it wouldn't happen at every meal, but certain foods or situations would trigger it. I was a chubby kid/teen, but went on an extreme diet in my early 20's. I ended up losing a lot of weight but then started having a hard time letting go of the diet again. Soon I realized I could take advantage of my RS by knowing what triggered it, and \"undo\" what I had eaten by doing just that. For example, I knew that eating large portions of food/drinking a lot of liquid would make me ruminate. So I started eating just one giant meal a day that I would eventually \"throw up\" through rumination. I knew that the carbonation in soda would help \"push\" the food back up, so I stopped drinking water and only drank diet coke. I found that rumination was much easier and more comfortable than conventional puking. In the beginning, things were pretty good - I could eat as much as I wanted and then relatively effortlessly get rid of it again. But the downside was that I would sometimes spend 1-2 hours slowly throwing up a meal. I would cancel social plans in the evening, because I'd spent most of it spitting up food alone in my room. Eating became shameful, something I only did in private. The giant binge made me feel disgusting and spending hours afterwards slowly throwing up my meal felt even worse. Eventually I felt myself losing control of my body (ruminating without triggers or when burping/hiccupping) and realized I needed to start fixing things. \n\nI've spent the past 3 years trying to recover and it's actually going pretty ok. I still have bad days, but they're getting increasingly rare. I now actively avoid my trigger foods and try to space out my meals rather than having one giant one, which helps. However, I always felt like I wasn't a \"real\" bulimic because I never puked in a conventional way. I even went to see a doctor to discuss my ED and I felt like I was lying to her because I never stuck my fingers down my throat to puke. Calling myself a bulimic always felt like such a scam, but I never knew how else to define what I was going through.

It saddens me to know that some people suffer with severe depression because of RS. My best advice is to embrace it and Learn to laugh at yourself if it happens unexpectedly.

It would last anywhere from 5 minutes after the meal, to an hour or two. I also explained to him that it NEVER tasted acidic unless the food itself was acidic. I also told him that I didn't mind it honestly because it always tasted exactly like it went down. I seriously don't think I have EVER had heartburn (people say I would know if I did). \n\nHaving said all of this, he decided to put me on pantoprazole. It has been a week and I half now and I literally haven't seen a difference in anything. If anything, it makes my stomach grumble/upset and causes diarrhea.

The focus was on the triggers and using diaphragmatic control to stop the rumination events. \n\nMy daughter is not \u201ccured\u201d but is doing *much* better. People who never knew would never realize now what she is dealing with, which is great as she plans to return to school in-person this Fall. I think she was a fairly moderate RS case overall. (I am certainly not an expert by any means.) She was almost never forced to expel, but ruminating at *every meal* at least 5-6 events during/after eating. She could not ever drink while eating without expelling. \n\nShe is now able to control all the rumination \u201curges/warnings\u201d or she calls them \u201cfeelings\u201d at nearly all her meals. She still does not drink while eating as she finds it to be too distracting. \nIf she accidentally eats *very* spicy food or eats very quickly she has a harder time and has to pay special attention when \u201cdistracted\u201d while eating. Recent flare up example was at a restaurant meal with a friend of hers - she was too excited to be with her friend and was just not paying enough attention to her intake/breathing. \n\nI know medical intervention either to be formally diagnosed or treated with this type of therapy is not available to everyone, but I wanted to share our success with the diaphragmatic therapy after a short period of rumination (less than 1 year). I truly hope this helps others feel that there is a method that may also work for them.

When I was 16 i returned to a school that I\u2019d already been to and noticed my syndrome getting worse. Was undiagnosed at the time and really wanted to fit in. I ended up not eating to suppress it and when I would eat I would just throw food back up again. Eventually got diagnosed with it. Later down the road because of this I developed two eating disorders, depression, Agra phobia and anxiety. Am still facing these issues to this day.

I have had rumination syndrome every single day since around thanksgiving in 2020. The doctors think it might have been caused by some very stressful stuff I went through in July 2020, and didn\u2019t pop up until around thanksgiving. I started ruminating, then I went down with a stomach bug, it got really bad, and has never gotten better. It fucking sucks. I love cooking and I am good at it, and I like eating too, but I can only enjoy good food that I make myself or that people make for me for a while, before I am ruminating every couple minutes for hours. It\u2019s Fourth of July and every one is eating food and having a good time and I\u2019m not eating because I\u2019m still ruminating from the food I ate 7 hours ago. The only time I don\u2019t feel sick is if I haven\u2019t eaten, but if I don\u2019t eat for too long I get really bad stomach pain. I\u2019m depressed as fuck most of the time because of this shit. I have had almost no success with diet change, diaphragmatic breathing, and other treatments I have read about. Weed works, calms me down and in turn helps my stomach settle, but I do not enjoy getting stupid high after every meal, because it ends up with me depressed and/or unmotivated. Im pretty desperate for some kind of treatment. There are only a couple things that make me happy anymore. All I want is to get better.. A lot of this post is just a vent I guess.

For the first few months I didn't really think much of it or notice it, but when I did, and told my parents, they got really worried. Ngl, I initially was quite okay with it. I mean, it meant that whenever I ate something bad, or maybe overate, I could easily just spit it out and it'd be as if I never consumed it in the first place. but thing is, now i just really can't help it - i dont even get to decide or anticipate when it's gonna happen or what's gonna come up - like salads or fish thats good for me. Of course it comes in handy when it comes to being super full and uncomfy or guilty for eating crap.\n\nFor me, this regurgitation thing is both controllable and uncontrollable. It'll come up whenever and I cant control that. However, I sometimes can encourage it to come up myself - which I shouldn't but still do (IDK it just makes me feel better sometimes). When I try to stop it from coming up it's really uncomfortable. It's like a heavy feeling in my throat or chest. Sometimes I can't tell if it's going to be a burp or actual regurgitation. Also i'm one of those people that regurgitate water too :( Another thing- everyone's saying it often happens to them within 10-15 mins after a meal, but for me it can happen anytime. Like even can be the case where my lunch food comes up after dinner. usually the later it happens, it may be slightly more acidic. If it's right after consumption tho, it wont be acidic at all. sometimes i kinda enjoy it. ew it's kinda gross thinking about it.\n\nAnyways, back to my journey, before i had no idea what this thing was, I went to a GI and we spent like thousands of dollars doing all these different things to figure out what it is I've got - like pills, breath test, endoscopy. We found that there was really nothing wrong except for the fact that my throat i think (can't really remember) was affected but the doctor said it's probably a result of this regurgitation thing - like the acid. He suggested going to see a psychologist cause he said if it isn't anything physical, it might be and eating disorder - and i really didn't like the sound of that. like i dont want my parents worrying about me having an eating disorder and i felt bad cause i thought it would be another waste of money. So we kinda let it be for the rest of the year but i recently, my parents made me go to visit a psychologist or psychiatrist not sure which\n\nExperience with psychsomething: I basically told her all my personal problems in my life and thoughts on those regurgitation. She concluded that it may be related to me putting too much pressure on myself or stress and that this regurgitation was a way of my body coping or dealing with this pressure.  She described the body as a house - it may look fine from the inside but if theres too much pressure in it, the walls may start to crack a little. This food coming up thing is something my body has learnt. Like it's addicted to it because whenever i do it, it feels like i'm releasing pressure (from my chest) so it makes me feel better. In the end, she didn't really give me any info on how exactly i was supposed to solve this thing but just to be less hard on myself. I don't think ill be going back again cause i dont think it really was that helpful cause i still dont know what to do. But maybe that may be helpful to some of u guys? not sure.\n\nNow: last night I was regurgitating a TONNE and i was so fed up. I mean i did overeat quite a bit yesterday but still, it was such a hassle to keep getting up to spit it out, and this time the stuff was all mushy thick and gross (sorry if thats tmi). Also i hate having it happen when im around people. first off it's gross, second if it's my parents, they get all worried for me all over again. so i decided to do some research. I ended up finding a bunch of youtube videos and stuff  on rumination syndrome so I feel a lot better cause now i know there are others out there who have the same thing as me :) Anyways, I'm determined to get rid of it cause i dont wanna have it my whole life. And i figure the later i leave it, the harder it'll be to get rid of it. So now i'm gonna be practicing diaphragmatic breathing as much as possible and eat my food slower. i hope that it'll get better and knowing that there are others out there who managed to get rid of it, i feel a lot more hopeful :)\n\nsorry this message is really long - just felt like sharing and it made me feel better to read about others having this rumination thing so i decided to share too", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ruminationsyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_28y4i8", "subreddit_subscribers": 266, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "my rumination experience", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ruminationsyndrome/comments/odd0yv/my_rumination_experience/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "neen12345", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8k58fgdb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1624781658, "domain": "self.ruminationsyndrome", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ruminationsyndrome/comments/o8svai/sick_of_having_to_get_up_every_time_i_ruminate/", "gildings": {}, "id": "o8svai", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ruminationsyndrome/comments/o8svai/sick_of_having_to_get_up_every_time_i_ruminate/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1624781669, "score": 1, "selftext": "Sometimes I yack in my mouth every five minutes, and it gets so annoying getting up to spit it out.

who have had rumination syndrome for at least 20 years (or, for as long as I remember, at least). I'm not diagnosed, but since I've had the symptoms all my life, I'm pretty sure this is what I have. It never bothered me when I was younger - it only happened after large meals, and usually I'd even kind of enjoy it. It never tasted awful or acidic. Usually it just tasted of whatever I just ate, sometimes even hours after eating.\n\nAbout 6 years ago I brought it up with a friend of mine in a casual way. Like \"you know when you mini-puke after a meal, and it's kinda gross but also kinda enjoyable at the same time?\" My friend looked absolutely mortified. She told me no, and that it certainly wasn't normal. I quickly back-tracked and played it off as a joke, but honestly I was shocked to learn that not everybody did this.\n\nLately I've experienced ruminating more often than usual (every day rather than 3-4 times a week) and is finally thinking about seeing a doctor about it. I just don't even know where to start. It feels embarrassing to admit that I've been experiencing this all of my life, yet never saw a doctor about it. It's also an unflattering and embarrassing thing to explain. Lastly, it's not even a diagnosis that \"exists\" in my country. I live in Denmark and there's no information about rumination syndrome whatsoever in Danish. It just doesn't exist.

The other day I used a coffee cup after it got bad and threw it away at a store--now I am afraid of going back. Growing up I used glass cups when no one was around and would sometimes forget about them, so my parents and brothers would stumble across them in drawers once in a while and become deeply disgusted. I have gone through so many fazes with it, from swallowing it, to using various portable cups, to sneaking to the bathroom, to spitting it out in public when no one was looking, to trying to ignore it. I have never met a person who can relate, and everyone seems to think that rumination = vomiting or bulimia, not understanding that it is so much less gross (food which tastes the same as before eating it). After what has been probably 22 years with this disorder, I just want to thank the moderators and everyone here for having this community and letting me know that I am not alone. Finally, others understand the process of hiding it and the social embarrassment and stigma of it. And, of course, doctors never knowing what it is. And not to mention struggling with weight gain and dealing with strangers and family gossiping about an eating disorder and my body when it has just been RS (except for a phase that lasted a few years).\n\nThank you all!

I don\u2019t do it on purpose, it\u2019s completely involuntary. I was diagnosed with acid reflux at about 4 years old, they told my mom to give me antacids and change my diet to prevent the reflux. None of that ever helped, I regurgitated after every meal no matter what I ate and it was never acidic. It tasted the same way coming up as going down. As a little kid I used to to chew it before swallowing it down and now I just swallow it. I\u2019ve never experienced heartburn or any of the other acid reflux symptoms in my life. Regurgitating never really affected me negatively since I had done it my whole life, and nobody ever noticed when it happened to me (swallowing back vomit basically). I\u2019ve never tried to do it, it just happens naturally to me and I barely even notice or care when it happens because it\u2019s like a daily biological function for me. I don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s like to not ruminate/regurgitate after eating. Up until now I actually thought this was normal to some degree because I never talked to anyone about it (I assumed everyone ruminated at least sometimes and that my problem was that It happened to me more often than normal). Today I got curious and looked up why it happens, and i was actually shocked to find out that it\u2019s not normal at *all*. It\u2019s supposed very rare and usually only happens to babies or people with severe cognitive disabilities, which is embarrassing. A lot of things online were claiming that people who do it are either doing it on purpose (because they\u2019re mentally handicapped and just want to re-taste their food?!) or because of a mental disorder, emotional trauma, or bulimia. \n\nMy rumination isn\u2019t caused by a mental handicap, mental illness, trauma or an eating disorder. \n\nI have anxiety, but it isn\u2019t related to my rumination. I did have some trauma as a teenager but I had been ruminating every day way before that. I have never been bulimic and I\u2019m fit physically and at a healthy weight, I\u2019ve always been at an ideal weight for my height. As far intellectual disability goes, I have no learning disabilities and I have always been somewhat intelligent. I\u2019m no genius, but I had my IQ tested as a child and it was considerably above average (although I hate to be one of the people who brings their IQ into everything). People have always considered me to be an intelligent person... I\u2019m far from cognitively impaired. I\u2019m not saying all this to gloat about myself, it\u2019s just that now I\u2019m wondering why the hell this happens to me. I\u2019m honestly really embarrassed by myself now. Is there a way I can stop doing it? I feel disgusting after realizing how abnormal it actually is. It seems like there\u2019s not much information about it, but I really don\u2019t think my issue is psychological.

I had very bad anxiety &amp; depression before the symptoms started and that just made it even worst.

We are Georgia Tech students and we are working on creating a biofeedback device for gastric disorders. This includes rumination syndrome! We hope to make a wearable device that can aid patients with diaphragmatic breathing. The device would analyze multiple biological signals to alert users when they are breathing incorrectly. This will allow users to adopt the proper diaphragmatic techniques and hopefully counteract rumination. To make our idea come to life, we need your help!

I\u2019m not sure if others have had the same situation of RS presenting in a kid so I figured I\u2019d share our experience thus far. Ok. Back to September 2020: My kid, C, is a *completely healthy* vegetarian 11 year old. No history of any major medical issues and virtually free of family medical issues as well. She had been doing this odd burp-run to bathroom-spit into toilet for a few weeks before I realized it was definitely happening every day, regardless of what she ate. As a distance-learning middle school kid with a wild little sibling at home she usually eats breakfast and lunch in her room during/between classes so it was really only after dinner I\u2019d be around her to see/hear this. Ruled out induced-vomiting early on as I was right there with her watching it happen through no effort on her part at all and she was not happy with the situation although she also didn\u2019t bring it up much. She said it was just annoying but finally admitted that it had been happening every day - after every meal - for over a month and that she was now usually just re-chewing and swallowing without even getting up (ok, wait, what?!) It couldn\u2019t be heartburn or GERD bc she has had heartburn before and she isn\u2019t a super-tough kid, she would have been whining and complaining that it burns etc.... I\u2019m a dietitian so I immediately think possible hernia, esophagitis, malfunction of pyloric sphincter, stricture or obstruction?... but the total lack of pain was a dead end for me. She has no history of swallow issues and she says it doesn\u2019t hurt to chew, swallow, etc. I cut her to an ultra-bland, low fiber, elimination diet thinking it\u2019s some new allergy flare up (so she is now only eating things like plain white rice. Bananas. Applesauce. Steamed Carrots or green beans. Plain white bread or crackers. No dairy. No citrus. No tomato. No chocolate, very little fat etc) but... no change except that she was completely miserable and starting to hate me. I also started monitoring her weight daily and after 2 weeks of no weight change I\u2019m at a total loss. Pediatrician  suggested three weeks of Prilosec and go back to normal diet, which is high fiber &amp; lots of variety. I figured it would be a dead end but also I\u2019m not a doctor and C isn\u2019t suffering or losing weight so we try the Prilosec. after three more weeks we are well into October and so far no better off. Now we wait to see the pediatrician again. One evening C is drinking water at the dinner table and immediately it\u2019s just right back up everywhere it\u2019s like her body is now rejecting even just water(!) no retching. Just rejecting. Now I\u2019m really freaked although again C says she\u2019s fine, nothing hurts. Well, like hell I\u2019m gonna just watch to see what happens to my kid next - we get a referral straight to a pediatric gastro-specialist. Couple weeks later (Nov 2020) we have a theory: Rumination syndrome. Not something I\u2019m at all familiar with but at least we have a name and the more I\u2019m reading and talking with C this really seems to be it. It fits every sign and symptom she has been experiencing. The only mystery is ... why? No conclusive answers there. Gastro doc says possible that it\u2019s a stress reaction to ::gestures broadly:: ... I wanna say 2020? Poor kid. Of course I\u2019m thankful up and down forever that this is something we can work out without surgery or even needing to involve needles. So we are scheduled for an early Jan first session with a pediatric psychologist for feeding therapy. essentially the plan is to reteach C how to eat and to train her stomach and brain to work together again to accept food without the rumination issues.

(This is why bulimics tend to have heart problems) but, importantly, it's still disruptive if you always swallow!\n\nI started wearing a fitbit with heart rate monitor recently.  It shows that my heart rate goes up SIGNIFICANTLY when I am eating/ruminating.  It's one of the main reasons I'm trying to stop.  My resting BPM is high, around 80 ish.  But when I eat, it's often hovering at 110, and can even get to 120, and this lasts as long as I'm ruminating.

The doctor said the results \"seemed normal.\"  However, I think it was looking more for arrhythmia than abnormal speeds.\n\nThe doctor was very adamant that rumination is disuptive to the body's electrolyte balance, and therefore, the heart.

I have been able to figure out the main food groups that always triggers ruminating. Dairy, meat, grains, hard fruit(apples only really), and oil/grease. Everything else outside of that can trigger, but mostly only in large volumes. Ice cream is my favorite, taco bell is the worst lol. \n\nWhen I was young, it was constant. But I was a stressed out miserable little kid. Bad past, and when I was adopted, I was incapable of actually connecting to anyone as family. I phrased the family experience as, Outside the window looking in. (This was figurative, but sometimes literal) Eventually, I chose to enlist to make sure I still had a future when my parents kicked me out. During those five years, I made tremendous progress in growing in myself mentally, and understanding ways I worked emotionally. Eventually I even grew to learn to be social. Invested. Interested. \n\nDuring that time. I have no idea when the vaaaassst majority of my RS disappeared. But I didn't even realize (except those rare moments I ate too much)  that it was gone until it came back nearly full force. \n\nI saw some threads that talked about varying levels of control over it. When RS is at its worst for me, I found I can sometimes help or stop the \"hesitant\" mouthfuls. But if I do help, or if it's not controllable, it doesn't stop for awhile varying every 5-15 minutes for the first 30 minutes, to an hour. And then it starts to wane down, taking longer in between til it tapers off.  Somewhere between 2-4 hours, with a few times getting up to 6 or 7. If I don't help the hesitant ones, it'll go both ways of either happening anyways but sometimes painfully slow, or not at all. \n\nThe uncontrollable ones are much faster. A lot harder to keep everything from jettisoning out. So gross. This one I have to attack with gulps of air and subsequent burps, so gross too, but somehow I can hold the food down while burping so less gross socially. Until I thankfully rarely fail to hold it down and liquids with small chunks comes up. Then the burp gargles. Ugh. \n\nLast but definitely not least, the relaxed one. This one is weird because I don't feel it or think about it until all of sudden, it just shows up in my mouth. These ones are somehow gentle? And front have any inertia behind them. If I had to say something stupid. It literally just materializes on my tongue. Chewing this one is comfortable, easy and tastes the best for the longest. But it also goes back down easy if I chose not to chew it again.

Sometimes he blows out his cheeks too. I had no idea what this could possibly be until I spent some time googling tonight and discovered this.

However, it keeps getting worse and worse because it is constantly happening for the hour or two after I eat. It only seems to stop once I start to taste any acidity. It's becoming really annoying...\n\nNo idea what this is or why its happening. It seems so sudden. I looked into it today and this disorder is what I found and it sounds spot on.\n\nNevertheless, I think I have this disorder. Now, how do I go about stopping this? If I really put my mind to it, I can kind of prevent it. I can still feel it wanting to come up. However, I can't keep my mind on it all day.\n\nBackground info: 19 y/o male, started to feel this happen when on a cutting diet (started lifting weights 6 months ago and I take diet and training very seriously). I also eat extremely high volumes of low-calorie dense foods so when I'm full, I mean I look like I'm in my third trimester. Perhaps this is a result of trying to get shredded with some diet guilt I sometimes wanted to act on, as well as COVID stress.\n\nSorry for the disorganized post lol.

She also has to have a port installed (which is a pretty serious procedure) so she can get regular IV bags.\n\nIn my personal experience with rumination, I experience no pain, no abdominal cramps, and I certainly have been able to go through both high school and college with no issues.

I've been looking for anything to help me but as I'm sure you all know there's pretty much nothing out there on the internet. \n\nI'm 20 years old and have had Rumination for the past year now.  I went 7 months without being diagnosed.  It was a really rough time. I was throwing up every single thing I ate and drank every day. Not to be gross but tbh this whole situation is gross. I would throw up for hours at a time.  I was unable to work or go to school. It completely took over my life.  After seeing multiple GI specialist and getting almost every test you could think of I was referred out to yet another specialist, who finally was able to diagnosed me.\n\nI guess you could say I felt some relief finally knowing what was wrong with me but mostly I felt confused.  It doesn't feel great to get an answer, but really the answer was nothing.  Yes, I now have an understanding of what is physically wrong with my stomach but no one will ever be able tell me why its happened, no one will ever be able to cure this for me.  To hear that this will never go away fucking sucked.  I waited for the day I'd get diagnosed so I could take action. I was ready to do whatever it took to feel \"normal\" again but i'm never going to get that.  I walked out of the office completely overwhelmed and with a new breathing technique which was my only form of treatment.\n\nFor the next few days I did the deep breathing and it helped to some extent.  I did throw up less, but it was a constant struggle.  I'd be breathing for hours all day because the minute I stopped I felt like the food would come out.  If I took a sip of water I could just feel I was about to throw up.  A few days after my appt the doctor called in a prescription for Baclofen, a muscle relaxer.  We talked about it in the office and he said it's worked for some people as it helps control the muscle contractions.  I was up for anything and started taking it.\n\nBaclofen has become my new best friend.  I went from throwing up everything I ingested all day everyday to throwing up a few times a week AND when I did throw up it was significantly less.  I still have bad days where I'll throw up more than once.  I also am extremely limited in what food I can eat.  I find that hard skins on food make me throw up.  Fruits are out, almost all veggies are out, meat is hit or miss.  I have the best luck with chicken but I never know when it's going to work or not.  Broccoli is the best vegetable but it has to be practically mush.  Pasta doesn't work.  Rice doesn't work.  I've tried smoothies but shocker those don't work.  Even my \"safe\" foods really aren't that safe.  They may work for a day or two but then randomly they stop working for me.\n\n As I said above the Baclofen has helped me but really I don't feel \"great\" again.  All it does is give me a higher chance of keeping food down.  Recently the past month/month in a half I've felt like the baclofen somewhat stopped working.  I don't necessarily feel like it will stop forever I've just noticed I've been having a rough time again.  It's felt like it did before I was diagnosed.  Possibly it's a flare up from stress or anxiety, as I know those play a role in rumination syndrome.  And to be honest my life for the past year has been a huge ball of stress and anxiety.  Who knows why im having a rough time but it's happening and it sucks.\n\nI have thought maybe the loss of my dad could have played a roll in this.  I read that trauma (loss of loved one) and stress could potentially be a cause.  I lost my dad when I was 18 and I got Rumination Syndrome about a year later.  Since losing him it's been very hard for me.  I've definitely been extremely stressed as losing him meant my family lost our main financial support.  I had to put my life and school on hold to help everyone else out.  I've been trying my best to help work on my daily stress, especially with having Rumination.  I know being stressed and anxious won't help me but honestly how could Rumination Syndrome not make you feel like this.\n\nI'm still not in school or working.  My throwing up is so unpredictable I never know when I'm going to throw up and as of now the quantity is at large.  It feels like I'm never going to get my life back.  I don't know what to do and it's killing me.   I just wish I could get some sort of handle on this.  I need my life back.  I'm almost 21 and I go every where with my designated throw up cups.  Again gross I know, but you've got to do what you've gotta do.  If anyone has any advice or similar stories I'd really appreciate it.

So I figured I would share those!\n\nIn general, I've always seen Rumination framed as something that people suffer from, and something that is involuntary.  I don't really remember suffering from it during my experience with rumination, and feel like I had nearly complete control over my rumination spells.  Mine started as a kid, and I basically remember rumination as a way to get seconds and thirds of my food.  I always kind of felt like I had control over it, although it was harder to control if I had the hiccups or if I way overate.  But in general, my rumination spells occurred more when I was eating a lot of something I really liked like chicken croquettes or chicken tenders or something.  After I finished eating I'd keep chewing for up to an hour and at times I totally loved it.  I only really stopped when I reached adult age, as my girlfriend (Now wife) in college felt it was super gross and always noticed me chewing when I thought I had been pretty private about it.  So for years (I'm 33 now, basically stopped at like 19) I didn't really ruminate at all.  I still can, especially when I overeat or drink too much booze, but I rarely use the skill these days if that makes sense.  \n\nI'd also add that in general I'm curious if there's anything else about me that might lend itself to rumination syndrome, since there's not a lot of info out there.  I was a VERY pukey kid in general, as I threw up on like 30% of car rides and got extremely motion sick.  That's gotten a ton better as I've aged, and matches similarly to how much rumination has affected me.  Which makes me wonder if me learning how to better deal with my motion sickness had a side effect of helping me deal with my rumination syndrome.  Or if maybe it worked the other way?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ruminationsyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_28y4i8", "subreddit_subscribers": 2, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Some thoughts on Rumination Syndrome", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ruminationsyndrome/comments/e17rj9/some_thoughts_on_rumination_syndrome/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "cantinabop", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_47kk4a0x", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574524748, "domain": "self.ruminationsyndrome", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ruminationsyndrome/comments/e0jnvk/rumination_syndrome/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e0jnvk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ruminationsyndrome/comments/e0jnvk/rumination_syndrome/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574524749, "score": 1, "selftext": "Also known as merycism.
