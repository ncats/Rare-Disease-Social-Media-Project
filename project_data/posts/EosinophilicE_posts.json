As time passed, symptoms worsened; therefore, I decided to visit the Gastroenterologist (GE) who performed an Upper Endoscopy. Result: 40+/HPF. Therefore, my GE determined that I had EoE and put me on indefinite PPI treatment (40mg of Omeprazole once a day). Under this treatment my symptoms vastly improved.\n\nSix months after I started PPI treatment I started experiencing some disconcerting side-effects. I was not taking anything else so I stopped using Omeprazole and the side-effects disappeared a week later. Also, the \"dry/rough throat after certain meals\" symptom came back and it was worse than ever for a few weeks. My GE told me that the side-effect could not have possibly been related to the PPI but I found studies that indicated otherwise; upon my reluctance to continue PPI treatment my GE told me to visit an Allergist. \n\nThe Allergist performed skin prick and skin patch tests. Result: several minor food and environmental allergies to the point where food elimination would be painfully difficult and prohibitively expensive. The Allergist started treating my environmental allergies to see if this would improve my food allergies. However, I had to discontinue treatment shortly after because of life. Subsequently, I gave up on this and resigned to live with my \"dry/rough throat after certain meals\", and cutting food in very small pieces and chewing very well to avoid food impaction.\n\nPresently, I started to realize what foods caused the dry/rough throat symptom and discovered this not always happened after eating something I am allergic to, but it is more likely to happen when I eat until I have a full stomach. However, I cannot even tell if this is heartburn or not.

Really, I'm unsure. Before I get into that, I\u2019ll share my little EoE story. I figure someone might benefit from it. If nothing else, I knwo there are a lot of people going through a lot worse stuff that I have with this disease. Still, you're not alone.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nExcuse the quickness \u2014 I\u2019m usually a good storyteller but am short on time right now.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nIn 2008, I attended a BBQ at a friends\u2019 place. There were a decent amount of kids around my age \u2014 23 \u2014 there, some cute girls, and it was, well, fun. I suck at beer pong (went to NYU \u2014 we don\u2019t have room for beer pong tables, etc.), nevertheless, I was embarrassing myself through a few games when I realized I hadn\u2019t had anything to eat. Someone told me they\u2019d get me food. They handed me a chicken breast \u2014 no bone, just a boneless breast. I started to eat it when that awful feeling struck. It was lodged in my throat! I could still breathe, but could not swallow. I kept trying but it wouldn\u2019t budge. I played it cool \u2014 no one even noticed. I escaped to the bathroom and started to freak. I tried to swallow, got some saliva, and my gag reflex was activated. My thoughts were: \u201cF word! F word! F word!\u201d An hour later, I was in the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nThe nurses were nice. Since I could breathe, they gave me a bucket to spit in, and we talked for a while.  They gave me various muscle relaxants to try to allow the impaction to go down. It wouldn\u2019t move. I was told they were knocking me out while some of their specialists performed a somewhat routine operation. They didn\u2019t have to cut me open or anything. I should be out in an hour or two. I woke 14 hours later and found out that they had needed two teams. It took them about 10-12 hours. My throat was fairly bruised up afterwards, so I would hang around the hospital for about five days. Lots of painkillers. Also, lots of doctors trying to figure out what happened. The chicken that was stuck in my throat wasn\u2019t anything too odd. No bone. Chewed well. It didn\u2019t make sense. One of the specialists there brought some students into my room. He wanted them to see a classic case of the then little known, \u201cEosinophilic Esophagitis.\u201d He showed them some imaging of my throat (maybe a Barium Swallow and something else) I had performed. And that was the first time I heard of EoE.   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nI found out that I had a lot of allergies I hadn\u2019t known of \u2014 including, like many of us, a ton of foods. None were that bad though. My seasonal allergies were worse than I thought. In being aware of all of this, I was able to minimize the chances of that happening again. I hope. Is till get nervous, though, literally every time I eat.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nRecently, well \u2014 in 2013, I had it looked at by another doctor. He performed an endoscopy. Leading up to that procedure, though, I was being very cautious about EoE (due to various reasons I was extra worried about it). So, at that time, I wasn\u2019t consuming any foods I was remotely allergic to, was maintaining areas where I spent a lot of time (bedroom, office) such that they were allergen free, clean, and, well ideal for me. I was exercising and \u2014 well, I was in tip top shape.   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nThe Endoscopy came back negative. I\u2019ve spoken with a few physicians and heard a few points of view but wanted to open up this question I have:  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nIn my analysis, form what I understand, it would make sense that if I had no antigens (allergens) in my system, I would not be producing any elevated amount of eosinophils, and, hence, there wouldn\u2019t be more collecting in my esophagus. I\u2019m fortunate not to have an ultra-severe case, and my heart goes out to those who do, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a threat. Whereas when most are exposed to antigens and do not have EoE symptoms, I do. My conclusion being that: yes, of course the biopsy was fine \u2014 doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have EoE.   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nAm I missing something?   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nDoes it make sense that, in a case like mine, a negative biopsy is essentially meaningless, and *does not* cancel out EoE?  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nThanks!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A Negative EoE Biopsy is Meaningless", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/42e4sl/a_negative_eoe_biopsy_is_meaningless/"}, {"author": "mrdrofficer", "author_created_utc": 1289063786, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_4hxic", "created_utc": 1448522925, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/3ubkua/next_steps/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3ubkua", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/3ubkua/next_steps/", "retrieved_on": 1450636731, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Thank you to everyone who has posted on this sub. It has been wonderful knowing that I am not alone and I hope one day we will find a cure for this. \n\nI just turned 30 and have had two throat expansions (sorry for the lack of terminology) this year and last. Prior to that I took no precautions for my EE. When I was 8, I first choked on fish and rice. I grew up in Hawaii, so you can see this was a problem. However, the doctors just said I didn't chew my food enough and that was that. I grew up having occasional choking incidents and assumed that was how everyone's throat worked. Only in the last two years have I found out how wrong I was. \n\nMy symptoms have gotten exponentially worse in the last two years, most notably that I had two bouts with dysphagia (inability to swallow) prompting the throat stretching. The only change has been a move to Austin, TX, a place I love but worry might be killing me. My gastro doctor knew of the condition, but I had to suggest it first. Only after the biopsy did he agree. He also did not prescribe me long-term steroids and my condition returned. Then, I got thrush and I had to diagnose myself, again, he agreed with me only after I diagnosed it. \n\nNow, I am seeing an allergist (my idea) and am now on Budesonide full time with omeprazole, 40mgs. I feel more tightness in the base of my ribcage, weak muscles and, most overwhelmingly, anxiety. All the time. \n\nI am hoping my shots work. My allergy tests showed that I am only allergic to rice and no other food allergies. I don't know what causes my throat to close these recent years, but I am hoping the allergy shots will work. A few of the things from my allergy test are not in the shots (cockroaches, rice) but I am following up on this and hoping for the best. \n\nTo everyone out there, I wish you the best of luck and a cure. If you have any ideas for me or your own stories, I would love to hear them. As someone else said on this sub, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, it has put unnecessary stress on my love life and career and is something I think about constantly. Now, I don't know my symptoms from my own mind, but I am hopeful this is temporary and I will find a way to not let it defeat me. I hope the same for you.

In the last 2 years my symptoms have become debilitating, with a feeling of trapped air in my chest becoming unbearable &amp; acid reflux that antacids can't touch. When this gets really bad I have panic attacks &amp; generally speaking I have become anxious about this, since it causes me to uncontrollably burp loudly to temporarily alleviate symptoms and it's embarrassing. \n\nI have tried omeprazole20mg, pantoprazole40mg, Lansoprazole 30mg, esomeprazole 40mg, domperidone, Fluticasone propionate (steroid inhaler), prednisolone 5mg (steroid tablets), Glyceryl trinitrate &amp; none of this has helped my symptoms at all. \n\nSince the anxiety became an issue that stopped me from going to lectures, seeing friends/family &amp; other general day-to-day stuff, I was prescribed diazepam 2mg which helped. I also use around 0.5mg of Xanax (alprazolam) when symptoms are unbearable and it allows me to eat/drink normally for quite a long period of time (up to 24 hrs). I have seen from other posts in EoE forums &amp; I know I am not alone in finding some relief from using Xanax, but I'm concerned about using it for prolonged periods of time and really I would like to manage the symptoms and become drug free eventually. \n\nI have tried many exclusion diets (gluten free, FODMAPS, high-alkaline etc.) you name it I've tried it and no, I have never noticed any particular foods/drinks causing me more hassle than others (although I stay well away from carbonated beverages). I have also tried acupuncture and herbal chinese medicine.. I had my 5th endoscopy last week which shows new ulcers in my esophagus which I guess can explain my symptoms becoming gradually worse recently. I am now back on Omeprazole.\n\nThis shit is ruining my life, has anyone managed to control their symptoms and have some advice for me? Also I'd be interested to see if anyone here who was not previously anxious became anxious at some point after their EoE diagnosis. \n\nPeace,\n\nJ.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Eosinophilic Esophagitis, Hiatus Hernia, Ulceration &amp; Anxiety.

I'll tell you my story, and then have some questions at the end about what to do next.\n\n**My story**\n\nStarted having acid reflux symptoms when I was 16 years old. PPI did not help, got an endoscopy which showed that there was nothing wrong. Finally noticed my mouth tingling after yogurt one day, so I got allergy tested. After eliminating the false positives, I was left with cow's milk, yeast allergy, and mild cod fish allergy. After eliminating these foods, the acid reflux completely went away. Fast forward several years and the acid reflux returns, I discovered that I was consuming additional sources of yeast that I wasn't aware of. Removing those foods again cured the acid reflux. Here I am, about 2-3 years later, avoiding all cow's milk, yeast, and I never eat cod, and my acid reflux flairs up again, this time with throat swelling in the back of my throat, which feels different from my normal allergic reaction.\n\nI go to the allergist, and the skin test shows I am only allergic to grass. Blood test came back negative for milk allergy as well, however, I believe I am still allergic to milk and yeast, and now is not the right time to be testing those things out with my flare up. The allergist tells me I have oral allergy syndrome (OAS) related to the grass allergy. After removing and testing some of the cross-reactive grass pollen foods (such as raw peanuts and corn), I felt much better. Corn was the main one. However my symptoms and reactions have been changing day by day for the past two weeks. As I was trying to do an elimination diet of only rice and vegetables, I found my throat swelled with some vegetables. I am suspicious of carrots, which makes me wonder about other pollens relating to OAS. As I have been trying to identify safe foods, the throat swelling got worse to the point that everything I ate was causing throat swelling. I tried to eat only rice or only oatmeal, but at that point my throat was continuously swollen and would flare up at anything I ate.\n\nAfter I read some research that said PPIs can help with EoE, I decided to try it again. The first day I took omeprazole and claritin, by the afternoon my swelling went down to about a 1/10 and I could eat my normal diet again without my throat swelling from everything I ate. This lasted for about 2 days, then I accidentally ate an allergy food, and I feel like it flared it all back up. I am on my 5th day taking omeprazole, and I feel tired, weak, have diarrhea and I think these are all side effects of the medication. Although it seems to be helping manage the throat swelling, I don't want to be on this medication long term. I've also heard that it is terrible for you. Which brings me to my questions...\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. Can EoE be managed entirely by diet and elimination of trigger foods? \n2. Are the medications (PPIs, steroids) just meant for helping heal and recover? Or do some people need them long term?\n3. What elimination diet do doctors prescribe for EoE?\n\nI am wondering if I just need to commit to doing a long term elimination diet to figure this out to avoid medication. Elimination seemed to work for me in the past, but now it appears my condition is more severe than it was, and I may have developed some new food triggers that the allergy tests can't pick up.\n\nI'm worried if I just go through with doctors visits and testing that the doctor's will not be familiar with EoE and won't be helpful... and it will just be time lost.\n\nI would appreciate any input you all have.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 3087, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Questions about EoE", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/s7zff4/questions_about_eoe/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "aramsey1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wb1fmgm", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642550400, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/s7bwf7/new_to_all_this/", "gildings": {}, "id": "s7bwf7", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/s7bwf7/new_to_all_this/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642550410, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey everyone!

One of my main (and most debilitating) symptoms is stomach pain, located in the center of my abdomen in the area between the bottom of my sternum and my belly button. It's kinda hard to describe what it feels like, but it's sort of like a dull aching pain/discomfort. However what's weird is that it tends to get worse or be brought on by movement/activity. Like, I might barely even feel it while sitting down, but if I get up and walk to another room I'm basically hunched over in pain. It has gotten so intense sometimes that I can't even do basic housekeeping tasks/chores like dishes or laundry without reeling from the pain. I mean, I don't know how it all works, but I'm wondering if maybe it's some kind of inflammation by the potential EoE that is getting irritated even more by movement/activity? \n\nI've never really heard of stomach pain like this being a symptom of EoE though so I was just curious to hear from others here and see if anyone else experiences anything similar? What makes me feel like it could be connected to the EoE though is that it seems to happen only when I'm experiencing my other EoE-like cluster of symptoms - throat tightness, dysphagia, chest pain, excess mucus production, stool changes, etc. I don't think it has ever happened alone as an individual symptom. \n\nI do want to note that I also have a moderate-grade hiatal hernia. But would that cause this kind of pain? I also have a history of GERD, but ever since going on an elimination diet this has pretty much become a rarity (I used to have reflux/heartburn multiple times per week and now it's probably a handful of times a year). \n\nDo any of you experience anything like this?

I'm 27 now, and things have gotten so much worse over time.\n\nI've never had food get stuck, and the difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) that I have is quite mild compared to most of you. Instead, I'm in constant pain. There's a throbbing, swollen sensation in my throat at all times. It feels like I'm having an allergic attack 24/7. I've been to the ER 46 times in 2021, all of those because I suspected my throat was swelling up from an allergic reaction. None of them turned out to be allergy-related. I often get a feeling like I swallowed a hard pill that got stuck in my upper esophagus/lower throat area, which makes for a sort of \"pinching\" feeling.\n\nI've tried everything at this point. I've used Jorveza, but that didn't work. I've used Benralizumab for 7 months, but that did nothing. I've been on PPIs, nothing. I've been to more allergists than I can count on both hands, and I'm none the wiser because my skin prick tests just keep coming back with more concerning results, and more sensitisations. Just last month I found out I'm now allergic to dairy and wheat as well. That means my EoE now reacts to all fruit, all vegetables, all spices, all fish, beef, all grains (including rice), all pseudocereal, eggs, all nuts, all seeds, dairy and all seafood. That leaves only chicken and pork, which at this rate, I will undoubtedly become sensitised to within the next few months as well. \n\nI've started having bloody, mucusy stools since a few months in addition to the above, which my gastroenterologist suspects might be eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Meaning that I can now look forward to other parts of my body also being all messed up just like my esophagus.\n\nI've been put on an elemental diet - a kind of medical drink with no discernible proteins in it that could trigger a reaction - and after tolerating that for a week, my EoE has come back with a vengeance to the point where I'm in agony within 10 minutes of drinking it. I can't sleep most nights, and if I do I wake up gasping for air because my EoE makes my throat feel so constricted.\n\nHow am I supposed to live like this.\n\nThe worst part is that my EoE was completely normal for a long time. I had a seemingly mild case. That is, until last year in March, when all this misery began. I honestly have no clue what to do anymore.

I had pancreatitis and ended up having my gall bladder out in 2014, so I've been dealing with lower GI issues for some time now. I went to see a new GI this year and brought up the dysphagia, and he immediately was much more concerned about that than my lower GI issues. \n\nI had my first scope in August and my biopsies averaged 40/hpf. At this time he also dilated my esophagus due to narrowing. My GI started me on Protonix 40mg (no diet changes) and we re-scoped early November. Counts were lower, but still averaging 20/hpf. I just met with him (had a bunch of crazy life stuff that kept me from following up) to review my last scope and he thinks I should try an elimination diet.\n\nHe said he usually doesn't have his patients eliminate all the major groups at once, since that's pretty difficult and less likely that patients will actually follow thru. Instead, he said to choose 1-3 groups to eliminate for a few months, then we'll re-scope in March. I guess the theory is that if I eliminate only a couple groups, but my counts go down, then those are likely my triggers. If my counts continue to go up, then the ones I eliminated likely aren't the problem and I can then do another few months with another group or two.\n\nHere's the deal, though. I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about this. Ever since we dilated my esophagus, I no longer have food impactions. As far as I know, that's my main side effect, but I'm wondering if there may be other, more subtle side effects that perhaps I'm attributing to other causes? What are other ways (besides scoping) that y'all were able to determine if the elimination diet was helping? \n\nI am overwhelmed and don't even know where to start, nor do I even know how to decide which groups to eliminate.

This sub has been so great in making me feel less alone with this scary condition. For about 10 years I\u2019ve had issues swallowing. I\u2019ve experienced about 4 choking issues a year. I\u2019ve learned how to carefully chew and swallow water after every bite to avoid issues. Finally I visited an ENT who suspected my issue was EoE. I\u2019ve never had gastric any issues before. I had a blood allergy test IgE test which came back as positive for EVERYTHING except dairy. I\u2019d eaten nearly everything on the list very frequently. The person calling with results was SHOCKED I never had anaphylaxis.  Until I met with an official allergist I avoided all things my IgE test tested for: gluten, nuts, and seafood. An EGD with biopsies confirmed EoE and during the biopsy my throat was stretched.  I got my throat dilated. That was a LIFE changer. It cost me a pretty penny but I was able to eat normal and with less fear than I had in years!\n\nI met with an allergist who performed a skin allergy test and she told me to start eating all things I had been avoiding. She said that the skin allergy tests were inconclusive and the blood tests I\u2019d taken previously had a 50% false positive rate. She mentioned this is extremely common for all her EoE patients. As per my allergist recommendation I have been avoiding exclusively dairy. \n\nI\u2019m currently on omeprazole 40mg twice a day and flovent. With upcoming biopsies I\u2019m hoping to stop Flovent and reduce omeprazole as quickly as I can (when the doctor recommends)\n\nGoing to the allergist was a game changer. I contemplated not going because I thought it would be a wasting of money going to an allergist who was going to tell me just to avoid all foods. It was so different than I expected and things have been great.  She was able to offer advice personalized to me. \n\nI am new to all of this is NOT A DOCTOR at ALL, but I just wanted to post that it\u2019s not all scary and doom.

I started developing the keto rash and because I have a cosmetic operation on my chest soon (small gyno), I needed for the rash to go away. \n\nI eate a small piece of chocolate and also 4g's of fiber on monday evening, then I had bloods drawn the next morning (yesterday). My eosinophils were 1x above range: 11.4% (1 - 6 normal range). Yesterday evening I had 50g's of whole wheat pasta. Putting me out of keto. My throat started to itch soon after that and in the middle of the night it started to hurt. Now it's starting to hurt even more and a sharper pain is beginning to manifest. Didn't eat anything yet today.\n\nSo, the question: could that little piece of chocolate and 4g's of fiber (arabinogalactan powder) have started this and then the wheat pasta yesterday just made it a lot worse? Or is this an reaction to the ketogenic diet and ketones? Seeing as I have keto rash and keto rash is supposedly an immune reaction to ketones.\n\nI am baffled, bc I don't know what to eat. If ketones are the problem, then fasting is a problem and so is eating meat and fats, as I did for the past 14 days. But seeing as the problems manifested just now, I am more inclined towards the carbs, either elevating the problem or creating it all together. So could that little piece of chocolate and 4g's of fiber have of elevated my eosinophils that much? I never had a problem, not that I know of at least with chocolate or wheat. Might have had a small reaction to both, but it's hard to say. \n\nCould glucose cause problems in all by it self? If not, then I can at least drink glucose and maybe add some whey isolate and coconut oil ...\n\nAppreciate any help you can give me.

I\u2019m just seeking some insight regarding eosinophilic esophagitis. I was diagnosed in Dec. 2020 and have been symptomatic since I was about 14 years old. I am now 22. My gastroenterologist put me on Pantoprazole 20mg to take daily and then Pepcid when I have a flare up (heartburn) I really sucked at trying to figure out my trigger foods, but to be fair my Dr. didn\u2019t act like we needed to do that? He mentioned we could try an Allergist if needed\u2026 now I wish I had immediately taken action on that. \nI\u2019ve cut out beef, pork, soda, candy, juice,  fried/fatty foods, fast food, spicy food completely. Of course I slip occasionally, so I don\u2019t have a for sure answer on trigger foods. \n\nFast forward to recently. Still having heartburn flare ups probably once a month, trouble swallowing still, bloating, back/jaw locking. My heartburn is severe and lasts approximately 6 hours every time. \nThen I developed a cold in October 2021, tested negative for everything and have been sick since then - Dr said bronchitis. I\u2019m never the type to get sick like this. I made a trip to the ER due to extreme pain in my stomach, wheezing, cough continued, heartburn. I also had some sort of allergic reaction to where my entire face was swollen and eyes puffy for about two weeks leading up to my ER visit - zero idea what could have caused it. ER said I was having bronchospasms and gave me an inhaler. All bloodwork/exams/x-rays showed I was healthy. He suggested possible autoimmune disorder? I have a high eosinophil count on blood work. \nCough is subsiding, but bloating/heartburn/swallowing issues remain. \n\nI am seeing gastro next month, but I would just like to get my life back :/ tired of always being afraid to eat and always in stomach pain. \n\nThanks!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2995, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "eosinophilic esophagitis heartburn/bronchospasms", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/rrx4ne/eosinophilic_esophagitis_heartburnbronchospasms/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Huge_Delivery_2109", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_adnbhika", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1640826413, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/rro9ix/steroid_and_ppi/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rro9ix", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/rro9ix/steroid_and_ppi/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1640826424, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve been taking pantoprazole and budesonide by Ivan pharm for 2 months now and I feel better than ever.

I would be eating food and suddenly it felt like my throat was closing up on me. After a few seconds it would pass and I would continue eating like nothing happened. For about a year, this became normal. My first couple bites would cause a reaction, then rest of the meal would be fine. But then I hit my first emergency while eating dinner alone at home one night. My bacon wrapped steak decided to stop on the way down. Nothing I could do would clear my passage. I could breath just fine, but couldn't swallow anything. My own spit was causing me to vomit every 30 seconds. I finally drove myself to the hospital where they had me stay overnight on morphine (which it eventually passed). In the morning, the went down and looked into my stomach and took the biopsy to confirm EoE.\n\nMy first doctor I was seeing to deal with this basically had no idea what he was looking at. He diagnosed me, but was lost on how to treat me. He would pull google up on his laptop in front of me looking at potential medications. Which honestly that is fine, but maybe not in front of me as it didn't leave me feeling all that confident. He put me on protonix and that was basically it. I asked about trying to find the source of the trigger and his answer was that its just so unknown that it wouldn't be worth it. So I left it at that and just dealt with the reactions when they came.\n\nFast forward about 7 years, nothing much has changed. Same mild reactions all the time but I knew to slow down and let it pass. Went out to Germany for some work and on my last day I went hiking. That is where everything went from manageable to pretty much hell in terms of my EoE. Unknown to me, I was bit by a tic while hiking. I went roughly half a year with Lyme disease as it messed with my body. About 3 months in, I was seeing doctors once or twice a week trying to figure out what was happening to me. The main symptom, my face was swelling up. Unfortunately, this caused them to ignore the many other signs of Lyme disease so it took them forever to think to test it. I was getting frustrated, so I started ordering whatever tests I could on Amazon, one of them being a food allergy test. \n\nThis is where things get back to EoE. It seems Lyme Disease took all these allergies that I must have had in the past, but made them significantly more worse. I have been eating apples all of my life, as snacks, in pie, etc. But know, one bite and my face will turn into a post mma fight. But on the EoE side, instead of having just a few triggers, I know have about 40. And this includes all the basics like eggs, wheat, dairy, caffein, yeast, chicken, red meat, etc. Even though I try to eliminate these items, it is still nearly impossible for me to avoid triggers now as there is no \"diet\" that works for me. Gluten free is a must as celiac disease that I didn't know I had is now so bad I can't eat a piece of bread without my EoE closing up my passage way. But all the other little things like Garlic, it just makes avoiding things near impossible. Anyways, just felt like ranting my story after seeing this sub reddit for the first time. I feel everyone's pain. EoE sucks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly cannot remember the last time I enjoyed eating food :(", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2972, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My EoE Life", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/rm740n/my_eoe_life/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Excellent-Advance-67", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_82fmjfwq", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1640146422, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/rlwol7/getting_dilation_surgery_done_what_should_i_expect/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rlwol7", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/rlwol7/getting_dilation_surgery_done_what_should_i_expect/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1640146432, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey guys!

In 2012 I had my one and only dilation after an episode that I had to go to the ER to have removed.  EoE is something I never thought that much about I just knew it was always with me I just needed to chew better.  Fast forward to today and I believe that I am on to something.  In January, for 31 days, my wife and I did a Whole30 program which we eliminated a lot of foods to \"cleanse\" ourselves.  We have been doing this every January for years.  For years, after 31 days I would run out to Mexican restaurant, pound chips and order a beer to celebrate 31 days of hell.    Since this January 1, I am full blown Ketogenic.  We did whole30, but with an emphasis with keto and I've stayed in ketosis to this day.  That being said I eliminated grains since January and in February I reintroduced butter, cheese, sour cream.......dairy.  I don't drink milk but I do consume other dairy products with the casein protein.  Why does this matter?   Cause my dumbass just now realized during whole30 I never choked and I could take an Omega3 supplement (huge pill) and other supplements that I take daily all at once.  Now I choke just on the Omega 3 pill.  My esophagus was clear and now it is constricted again.  I have eliminated grains from my diet and I am on day 5 or so of cutting out dairy.  I've been egg and fish free as well but I had these on Whole30 so I think my issue is  dairy?   I did some research and dairy is supposedly the #1 cause of EoE.  Honestly until I became ketogenic and I have seen dramatic changes in myself, did I realize that food has that much of an impact on our health.  Just the other day did I look at my pathology report that I had since 2012 and read where it said I had EoE.  The gastroenterologist never mentioned I might have an allergy and I was just glad it wasn't throat cancer.  Now I am determined to find what is causing this reaction in my body.

I was able to eat what I want, when I wanted.\n\nHowever, about six weeks ago, I had a bout of bad diarrhea. It lasted a few days but then returned to normal. Unfortunately, I started to get really bad heartburn. After about a week, I reached out to a GI doctor and he put me on Protonix. I tried it for a week with no relief, so a week after that I switched to Prilosec. It helped the heartburn, but now I have have frequent \"wet burps\" with regurgitation after meals. After about a month with symptoms, I went in for an EGD, and I was diagnosed with EoE. I do not have my exact number, but I assume it to be over 15. \n\nI trust the diagnosis, but many of the symptoms don't match up with me. I never had trouble swallowing, and I get maybe one case of food impaction per year, but I always put that on me being stupid and not chewing a tough steak for long enough. I was always able to clear it by forcing myself to vomit by putting my finger down my throat.\n\nI did bloodwork yesterday, and I am waiting for my allergy results. As of now, after playing with my diet a bit, I can't seem to find any specific triggers.\n\nYesterday, my doctor put me on 0.5mg Budesonide, which I have been mixing into a slurry with five packets of Splenda.\n\n**My questions are:**\n\n1) Is it common to have EoE with just regurgitation? I have very little heartburn, but the regurgitation follows after almost every meal.\n\n2) How long does it take for the Budesonide slurry to start to work? The studies I have read have shown improvement over a span of months, but I wonder when I should be actually feeling it? I've taken three doses so far and the only thing I notice is a bit of burning when it's in my esophagus.\n\nThanks for all your help and support!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "EoE, But With Weird Symptoms", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/82y0ed/eoe_but_with_weird_symptoms/"}, {"author": "dissguy20", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1519957939, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/81b1mg/looking_for_advice/", "gilded": 0, "id": "81b1mg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/81b1mg/looking_for_advice/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1520019025, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 6, "selftext": "31/M diagnoised with EoE for 3 years now.

During the processes of figuring it out, I took him to his normal doctor because he kept throwing up. After giving him some zantac and that didn't help, they did a blood test in him and found out he had the H pylori infection. They loaded him up with antibiotics and did a follow up to check if the infection was gone (it was).\n\nAfter this infection he kept on barfing every few weeks, but felt fine. I took him to the local GI clinic to see if they could figure it out. They were dumb founded and didn't know what else to do besides give him more medications. They didn't want to do an upper scope because he was still under 18. \n\nI then took him to the local children's hospital to see a GI specialist. With his first appointment this doc had it narrowed down to either EoE or cyclic vomiting syndrome. She got him in right away for his first upper scope. \n\nAfter the results came back, it was confirmed that he has EoE. They changed his meds to omeperzole 40mg once a day, and Flovent twice a day (he swallows the medicine instead of inhaling it). It was working out for him until this year. He started vomiting while sleeping. So they increased it to 40mg twice a day. That helped for a short bit, but as of this month he's been vomiting almost daily. He would eat a meal, feel fine, and vomit up his meal anywhere between 6 to 12 hours after he ate it. After calling almost daily, they put him on an allergy medication he takes twice a day (which doesn't seem to do much because he is still vomiting a good 3-4 times a week. He has his next appointment coming up in April, and I need some suggestions of what else can be tried. We've done diet elimination, and its all different types of foods that set it off such as dairy, starches, noodles, and anything red in color. The only thing he can keep down is jello, water, sprite, and chicken broth. It seems as if he just keeps getting worse. \n\nHe was always a really healthy kid growing up, he hardly even got a cold. Now when he gets a cold, it lasts weeks and he feels absolutely horrible. I've actually had to pull him out of school and begin to home school because the vomiting got so bad. I am not sure if we should see an allergist or even if they can even figure out what he is allergic to.

Do you have relfux too?  I know that eoe can also be caused by allergies to food and drink.  I went through all that, did a 6 food elimination diet, found nothing that was causing the irritation, other than reflux.  Oh and I forgot to mention that I also have a hietal herrnia.

Finally went to the ER and got some muscle relaxers for the esophagus muscles (not sure how they target those), which didn't help, and eventually an endoscopy. Since then I've had some episodes here and there and when my pipe gets completely occluded, simply waiting an hour or so will result in its own resolve. Well, I'm sitting at around 5 hours with no change right now and I can't even swallow my own saliva! I have to work tonight 9p-9a so I can't hit up the ER until tomorrow, and certainly wouldn't expect an endoscopy to be done tonight even if I could go. So wish there was some sort of instant relief for this shit so I could eat. SO HUNGRY!!\n\nUPDATE: It sorted itself!! I woke up at 9:45p (turns out I only needed to work 11p-9a) and felt a good burp come out. When your esophagus is so tight you can't swallow anything, you also can't burp much, so when I did I knew something was easing off. Once I got to work I tried drinking the smallest amount of water and felt no esophageal cramping or the need to try to get that water back out. I took another sip, this time a bit bigger... still nothing. So I took a big gulp in hopes of really testing out the ole pipe and voila! It went down smoothly :D All is well now and I've eaten a couple of times since. I'm definitely going to go back on Flovent though as that nearly eradicated all my symptoms.

I had a very serious response to several types of pain killers, as well as the 8 main allergens, legumes, most vegetables/fruits. When I was first diagnosed, these responses were less severe, and although I reacted, the only thing my multiple skin prick tests and blood tests showed were an allergy to tree nuts, shellfish and citrus.

I was off at college and then working in a different city and now I'm back. After my dad passed away I started to experience the weirdest sensations in my throat and had no clue what was going on. My zantac was no longer cutting it and I was trying to take more but it still did nothing. My throat issues continued to seemingly get worse where at first it felt like something was stuck in my throat it started to progress to a tightness feeling which is still hard for me to put in words. In my mind it felt like the muscles in my throat had completely locked up very tightly. The throat sensations got worse and changed to more of a choking feeling at times.  Eventually it got better and better and felt like it was gone. Then it came back a week later and I started feeling lumps in my throat so I went to urgent Care and they had no idea and thought it was just anxiety. I went to an ENT and he said it was probably lpr prescribed me protnix and said to see a gastroenterologist. I scheduled the soonest appointment at my old doctors office and it was a month away. After a while of the protonix not working I started taking a nexium at night. I went to an my gp and he tested my thyroid and did an ultrasound and did blood work and said to follow up with my gastroenterologist appointment. In this time my throat seemingly healed after taking both protonix and nexium. So I went to see a gastroenterologist, my doctor had retired and I saw a new doctor. This doctor said pulled up my biopsy results from 6 years ago and said he saw that I had cells that showed I had both gets and eoe. That was a month ago. He had me schedule for an egd and that isn't until the end of this month (they must be very busy). In the last 2 weeks my symptoms started getting worse. To make matters worse I ran out of the protonix prescription and both the ent and gastroenterologist want me to take off work and pay to schedule a visit just for them to refill it. At this point I'm taking nexium twice a day and my throat is about as bad as it has ever been. I've been reading online and it does mention that environmental allergens can cause flare ups. I live in the south and we do have lots of pollen and reports of lots of dust from the Sahara moving in the area. Idk why my throat is so bad right now, but nothing seems to help. I take prescription singulair and have even tried taking Benadryl but nothing helps. What should my next step be? Should I wait for the egd, should I see an allergist. Is there something I can do to help my throat not feel like it's being choked? Medicine? Eat something? Drink something? I've also noticed that sitting a certain way on the couch hurts my throat, is this possible or is this in my head? My real question is, does anyone else have similar flare ups? Am I maybe experiencing something other than eoe? Also, I don't really have problems getting food down all the way although sometimes I have to drink to get something all the way down. this only started this year. And It feels like mucus just sits in my throat and stays there during flare ups which seem to last for months.

It's helped but I still have swallowing issues.\n\nMy EoE has seemed different from everyone else's I've read. I've mainly had swallowing issues (in January I was washing down every bite with water) and have never gotten food stuck, ever. When I got my endoscopy, the doctor said that my eosinophils were found in my upper esophagus. No structures but they did dilate my esophagus a bit. He said my upper GI and esophagus looked normal- it was the biopsy that showed that I had eosinophils.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? Only swallowing issues? Anxiety flares yours up? My husband thinks I may have thyroid issues- it can often mimic this. im seeing a specialist in Chapel Hill, and am hoping he can help.

Usually if you can get to a bathroom and have access to copious amounts of water, you can force things through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, for bystanders or other not familiar with the condition, it can induce panic. An event in a restaurant can be a lot. People want to call an ambulance or try the Heimlich, etc. Not to mention, it can be embarrassing. Yes, I've taken a drink of water while sitting at a table only to realize too late that I can't swallow it and lose it over the banister.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I'm betting I have the mother of all EoE / impaction stories:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year I had RF ablation on my sinuses to open them up. It works like a dream, and allowed me to breathe more freely than I ever have. But for several weeks afterward while your sinuses are healing, you get nosebleeds at the drop of a hat.\n\nAt about week 3 after that procedure, I took a flight to New York to do some charity work. A group of us got picked up at the airport by a bus that took us upstate. On the way, the driver let us know that he needed to stop for gas, and we went to a place that had a nice market on the site. He let us know that if we wanted food or snacks at the hotel, we should pick it up then. We had about 15 minutes while he filled up the bus.\n\nI went into the market and loaded up on some snacks and drinks. When walking by the deli, the guy hands me a free sample of chicken. I wasn't thinking, and popped it in my mouth and swallowed. BAM, it stuck. Hard.\n\nKnowing I had about 2 minutes before I threw up saliva, I got in line and bought 3 bottles of water and headed to the bathroom. I was hoping I could clear the chicken before the bus had to leave....but after the first bottle of water, it was pretty clear this chicken wasn't going to budge. The clock was ticking, so I opened bottle number 2. Still no luck. \n\nAbout halfway through bottle 3, I had a new problem (other than almost being out of water). The pressure from throwing up had ruptured my still-healing sinuses...now I had a steady stream of blood draining into my throat with no place to go.\n\nAt this point, the bus driver came into the bathroom to see if I was OK (the door didn't lock). I wasn't able to answer him. So all he sees is his passenger looking like complete garbage - and then I threw up the blood that was building in my throat. \n\nThese people lost their MINDS. For all they knew, I had ebola. It triggered full-on panic in the market. 911 call, ambulance, the works.\n\nI was able to convince them that I really was OK, and get back on the bus eventually. But I spent the next 2 hours periodically throwing up blood and saliva into a large plastic bag while the other passengers all sat as far away from me as possible.\n\nThe chicken cleared within 10 minutes of getting to the hotel.\n\nNobody from the volunteer group that was on the bus with me that day has spoken to me since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes things are so crazy like that - there isn't anything to do but laugh.

So I was recently diagnosed with EOE ( last month). Basically here for moral support/help/ advice.  Pretty much been having gi problems for about three months. Did my endo. Gi thought it was gastritis with possibility of eoe. I was put on protonix. ( idk what it was but I had a bad reaction to it. Waking up in the middle of the night with bad gas pains.  A little dizziness  big gas pains during the day...) then switched to nexium  for about a month.  Still experienced gassiness during the day.  Idk if it was the meds or just symptoms of the eoe.  Regardless I had one really bad week. Where for about three days I could barely eat or drink anything. Would fill up so quickly and have bad stomach pains. Went back to the doc. He gave me budoneside ( however u spell it ) and Zantac.  He said because of the lack of responsiveness to the ppi and because of high number of eosinophils he diagnosed with eoe.  Sorry for the long post. All in all did all the food allergy testing came back negative. Allergist believes it most likely wasn\u2019t food that caused the reaction. However I am allergic to all environmental factors. Dust trees mold ragweed etc.  my allergist said sometimes env factors could cause eoe but sometimes these things just happen.  I\u2019ve just started my elimination diet. They gave me 3 foods to do dairy wheat soy. But I\u2019m also doing eggs and fish.   All in all does anyone dealing with this have any advice? Did the medicine help?  did you take both a ppi or h2 blocker and the budenoside? So far I haven\u2019t really had too much trouble swallowing. More difficult with dryer foods. I do however fill up relatively fast. I\u2019ve lost a tremendous amount of weight dealing with all this. Tired of dealing with everyone\u2019s questions. What\u2019s wrong? Are you ok? Why you so skinny.  ? Lol. Last year I was around 260. And now I\u2019m sitting at 196.  No energy no motivation to do anything.

Pork Chops in 2011 and Steak in 2018\n\n\\-Multiple impactions that could lasts for minutes to hours but warm water seems to help most although soda sometimes worked too.\n\n\\-Throat dilated in 2011 after the first ER visit.  Should have read the details because the doc NEVER mentioned food allergy.  \n\n\\-I started Keto diet January 2018.  Started to improve my health.  Read about elimination diet along the way.  Since Keto, I have cut out wheat, all dairy.\n\n\\- I went to Costco and got a bottle fish oil pills.  Why?  I would attempt to swallow one pill and it would get caught in my throat but dissolve in about 5 minutes.  I noticed sometimes I could swallow that pill and some others at the same time but other times just the one big ass fish oil would get stuck.\n\n\\- Decided to go full carnivore or zero carb with my diet.  Main food I was eating that could cause my issues that I was still eating was eggs.  Cut them out.\n\n\\- Within 5 days I went from choking on one pill to swallowing a bunch no problem.  Reintroduced eggs and swollen shut again.  Cut them back out and 5 days later clear again.\n\n\\-I plan to reintroduce other foods just to see what happens but for right now I will never have eggs again:(   Glad to finally self diagnose my EOE and know that if a flare up happens I can clear it up quickly using a carnivore diet without eggs.  \n\n\\- Plan is to introduce almonds next.  Will see if my fish oil pill gets stuck.  BTW......when I reintroduced eggs it took 2 days for my throat to stop the pill.  \n\n\\- Best of luck to all you and hope you can figure out what is causing your issue.

It did not go well, Infact that small tablet was enough to block off my entire esophagus, I spent a lot of time trying to throw it up or swallow it. Romantic right? Eventually I just went home spitting in a bag the whole way as I couldn\u2019t swallow my own saliva. I went to bed figuring it would dissolve over night if nothing else.\n\nNext morning I woke up it certainly did not dissolve, so it was probably urgent care time, I figured it would be quick, I was very wrong, after multiple nurses not quite getting it and telling me to just swallow it, or giving me things to swallow they took a large metal piece and put it in my throat, similar in size to a gun (I was later told by doctors that it was usually done when the patient is under anesthesia) after all of that nothing so they sent me to the major hospital in the big city I live by.\n\nOnce I got there, I don\u2019t remember much but it ended with I needed surgery. Great. Quick little surgery right? Hour tops. Wrong again boss, five hours with four surgeons from three teams. I woke up with a tube hanging out of my nose, which I was not sure what it was. It turned out to be an NG tube. \n\nAfter this I was moved to a hospital room and told I\u2019d be there for a while, the next morning I was told my esophagus was very messed up as a result of Eosinophilic esophagitus. I had no clue what that was, I do now. I was also informed that the pill was Infact still lodged in my esophagus to my doctors surprise who thought it was a phantom feeling. \n\nI spent a week in the hospital hooked up to ivs and my ng tube machine. I\u2019m very thankful for all of the support from my girlfriend, my dad, my mom, my stepmom and my sister. After a week I was released from the hospital on our anniversary with a backpack with an NG Pump still hooked up to my nose\n\nWith that pump it went off every four hours or so, often in the middle of the night, sounding like a fire alarm.  First tip : put the tube over your ear to keep it from pulling and to keep it out of the way.\n\nAfter two weeks of that I went in for an esophagram and was told I could take the tube out! Only catch was no eating, only baby formula (yuck)\n\nAfter a while of baby formula, on to any liquid food, pur\u00e9es really \n\nA few tips: invested in a hand blender\n                      Eggs are easy to mash with a fork\n                      Make light of your situation \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nAs of a week from today I\u2019ll finally be allowed to eat solid food again, while this journey is almost over it did take a toll on my body, lots of weight loss, my first weigh in after being released I was 117lbs, the catch is that I\u2019m 6\u20181\u201c tall, veeery skinny. Some things to keep weight up that help are eggs, protein shakes, and peanut butter. \n\nAnyways that\u2019s been my experience so far, I\u2019m on Flovent and Prilosec. Any tips would be useful.\n\nMy girlfriend, family and friends have made this so much easier, not sure how I\u2019d do it without them. We all have lots of plans to go eat when I can again.\n\nThank you for reading!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 666, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My EoE experience and Liquid diet tips and tricks.", "updated_utc": 1554499876, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/b8ctwb/my_eoe_experience_and_liquid_diet_tips_and_tricks/"}, {"author": "Codarar63", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_o473f", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1554107010, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/b7zffd/new_to_eoe_and_just_vomited_blood/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "b7zffd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/b7zffd/new_to_eoe_and_just_vomited_blood/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1554107011, "score": 4, "selftext": "I made an earlier post about being new to EoE.

Can your throat swell enough with EoE that you can\u2019t breathe? Or is that not a thing? \n\nBackstory: \n\nFor a while now I\u2019ve been telling my husband that I keep feeling like I\u2019ve got stuff stuck in my throat. One night I took a pill and it just stayed there. He told me to eat some bread and drink some water, so I did, but it didn\u2019t move. By morning it was lower, but still there. I kept thinking I needed to chew my food better and have been trying to focus on that, but haven\u2019t really felt like it\u2019s helped. \n\nHowever, I also experienced a reaction where I got hives on my face, itchy ears, and felt like my throat was swelling. I took some Benadryl and it went away after awhile. Then last night it happened again: it started with hives on my face after sampling some food I was feeding my baby, then about half an hour later I started eating dinner of rice and ground beef with avocado, and my throat got pretty tight, fairly quickly. I was pretty panicked and after about 45 minutes and some Benadryl, I finally decided to give myself one of my son's expired epi pens (he outgrew a peanut allergy but I kept them around just in case). Now I\u2019m wondering if the other symptoms I thought were anaphylaxis (heart palpitations, dizziness\u2014 no difficulty breathing though) were actually just a panic attack in response to the EoE? I\u2019m just confused about it all. The thing is, the epinephrine didn\u2019t really help immediately the way it is supposed to, but by the time we got checked into the instacare my throat felt 75% better. The remaining 25% is still there today, 24 hrs later. Does Benadryl help with EoE? \n\nJust so confused. Obviously I need to see a doc, but they are all booked up for weeks.

This disease can be very frustrating and start to impact your everyday life. Over the past 5 years I have worked with Gastro's, Nutritionist, Elimination diets, Naturopaths, and any other option's I could find. My symptom's got worse and worse including, **Choking, stomach ulcers, hemorrhoids, Constant Diarrhea, Anxiety, and Depression**. These were all symptom's I had never experienced before in my life and they continued to get worse.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n\nI was diagnosed with **EOE** just after I finished up College. I had been having trouble swallowing food for the past 3 years and kept trying to convince myself it was just me not chewing my food enough. These symptoms intensified to the point of me being too afraid to eat anything along due to choking. At times I would have a banana get partial impacted in my Throat. Despite all this it was the horrible **chest pain** I was experiencing that got me to go to the doctor. I explained the chest pain and my doctor total dismissed it as it being anything cardiac related (As I was in great shape and 24 years old). I casually mentioned that I also have trouble getting food down and often find myself **choking often** (need the heimlich maneuver performed on me twice). This was an immediate concern and my doctor sent me to a **gastroenterologist** since **\"difficulty swallowing is unnatural\"**.  (This made me feel very silly for thinking choking on food could not be the symptom of something else). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Frustation:**\n\nAfter the Gastro did all the tests and procedure's I was diagnosed with EOE  and was told my throat was as narrow she has ever seen. I then was recommended to do **allergy testing**. The first thing they tell me is, just so you know, some of the  indicators that show up may not be a trigger for you, and some of your triggers may not show up. (So this information did not help me at all and I just got the pleasure of having A itchy back). \n\nThen my Gastro explains why my body is attacking foods that enter my body but without any clear guidance on what foods to eat or avoid. I literally left the office went to a grocery store and was **at a complete loss**. What in this place is going to make me choke and what should I try to use a fuel?? It got to the point where **I hated the idea of eating** and continued to hope that one day I wouldn't have to eat food again. \n\nAfter each attempted at changing my diet my Gastro would want to **put me out** and stick do **another Upper Endoscopy** to see how I was effect. This process was very burdensome and expensive.  I started researching different ways people have tried dealing with this disease. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Treatmeant:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Intermittent Fasting**: Limiting my eating window to a 10 hour window during each day (For me 10AM-8PM). I immediately felt a relieve in my lower GI issues. I was having Diarrhea (5-10 times a day) and hadn't had a solid stool in years. Intermittent fasting helped in this area but not in the throat or stomach. If your still consuming foods that are triggers for you, fasting will not help. But this was one of the first treatment's that I found some relief in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Elimination Diet (Extremely limited)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter  years of struggling with this disease and continued frustration I was \"**over\" food.** I started to **resent** every part of it. I was also having **horrible mood swings, anxiety, and depression.** This is an area that I feel is strongly related to my EOE and inflammation in my body. I finally asked my doctor, is there anything I can survive on, **eating just one food**. I was told it is not ideal but in extreme cases people have limited themselves to just **\"Potatoes\" or just \"Beef\"**. I started with Potatoes because I always assumed beef was a trigger. This was one of the most common types of food I would get impacted. This did not go well and I was able to identify Potatoes as an obvious trigger of my EOE. I then tried beef and was recommended to start with ground beef since I had a fear of impaction. I ate Ground Beef and water, **THAT IS IT, without exception**. I immediately started feeling some **relief**. After about 3 days my stools started becoming completely normal (2 times a day). After about 4 or 5 days I felt a compete **clearing of my head mentally**. This was a symptom that I was undetectable until it was gone. I felt like I was on some **Psych medication** and just got off for the first time in years. I was **ecstatic** and felt like I **got my life back**. After staying on this extreme \"Beef and Water\" diet for about a month and **all symptoms continued to improve until they were gone.** I took blood tests and had **no traces of Eosinophil cells** which were normally off the charts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Adding new foods:** \n\nUnfortunately, after eliminating all symptoms, my reaction's to new foods introduced were much more **volatile**. I would add a new food to my diet for a few days. Almost immediately(IF it was a trigger) I would feel the **swelling in my throat**, and everything getting tight. My next morning would be filled with **gas and diarrhea** again. A couple days after that my **hemorrhoids** would be flaring up. About 5 days after this reaction I would fall into complete **anxiety and depression**. After going back to just \"Beef\" symptoms would clear up in about 5 days. This was a very hard experience for me but I had confidence knowing I was truly finding out what I could eat and could not eat. **Without any speculation.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have continued to attempted new foods and have found that I can eat **Beef, Cheese, Butter, Salt, and Water.** This is my daily food intake each and every day at the moment. It has taken me over 4 Months to identify these foods. Ive been able to confirm many many more food items that are absolute triggers. I know this is very hard for many people but this disease was taking away from the quality of life sooo much that I had no other choice. It continues to be a very long road for me but since feeling what appears to be \"**Symptoms Free**\" I will never go back. **My Goal is to find a balanced diet of nutrient's and substances**. It will be a **long road** but for me this is the only way I can truly feel symptom free. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Personal Experience this EOE can feel frustrating and leaving you hopeless for what to do. I hope this helps or at least shed's some light on how **vastly different people's triggers are** from one another. I know a couple other people with EOE and can't eat any butter or dairy products. So, it really seams like everyone has different triggers which is part of why it can be so frustrating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for stopping by and reading my story. I will update as my diet progresses!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*I work close with physician's to monitor Blood Health, Cholesterol, and other regular testing to ensure I am not creating another problem with my diet. (Surprisingly my Cholesterol  is fantastic! Which I was very concerned about due to my high amount of Beef, Eggs, and Butter)\\*\n\n  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 630, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Frustration's When I was Diagnosed and How Things Got Better", "updated_utc": 1554024015, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ay3psu/my_frustrations_when_i_was_diagnosed_and_how/"}, {"author": "dissguy20", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_r495gcx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1551817643, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/axps8l/elimination_diet_without_endoscopies/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "axps8l", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/axps8l/elimination_diet_without_endoscopies/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1551817645, "score": 4, "selftext": "I\u2019m being cheap and trying to save 1.5K for each endoscopy.

Pretty much j could t swallow anything which has never happened. I usually can go to bathroom and throw up but u tried twice and couldn\u2019t fully clear so I had to have then cancel my food and tell everyone what is going on. I didn\u2019t know anyone well and have social anxiety so it sucked. Also since we told waiter I had an allergy I feel like they thought I was bluffing since I didn\u2019t have traditional symptoms of an allergy. \n\nAnyone else have something similar happen? \n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 627, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What\u2019s your most embarrassing moment w this allergy??", "updated_utc": 1553974310, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/aws3t5/whats_your_most_embarrassing_moment_w_this_allergy/"}, {"author": "pm_tits_for_bitcoin", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_e8k8q", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1551373509, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/avtfg2/discord_server/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "avtfg2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/avtfg2/discord_server/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "gLv1hXC5H-dOZA2ETOOv1wDrTJS5cy2707t3DYxxt1U", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ef7be3ded6d2d649391ab86abbab4e3b2ab0e2f", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7d1535eea0937cf9414af62f46fe08faadc25c8", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f80d9822c8ba0587b25321bfc0add5f96be4d81", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e474dccd0dbda8f4379df1bdd01c8661da513905", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=942fb00c34ea22c3093e827f3684db4fc202c79a", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24a7b9f6989f1a1ceeb508361c932e8c793ea7a0", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3e72d342623188d4efcb37612ba1a890eb5a3647", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1551373510, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hey guys!

A month ago I started feeling pain in my chest and it was getting very difficult to swallow. \n\nFast forward 5 endoscopies later and I find out I had a 4mm stricture in my oesophagus due to the long build up of eosinophils (the fibrotic tissue). I've always been a slow eater but I never thought I had something wrong with my oesophagus. My doctor has dilated me three times (2mm at a time) up to 10mm now and to be frank the last dilation sucked. Im starting to get tired of them. \n\nI know that theres no cure to this (thanks to the bountiful information here!) but I just wanted to know how are you guys after your diagnosis? I don't see many people here talking about strictures and dilations which seems to be my focus right now. My doctor did put me on Jorveza (budesonide) and PPIs, but I dont really feel any difference after starting them. What happens after my doctor finishes dilating me as much as I can? My doctor keeps telling me to take things step by step but I dont like my future health being vague like this.

So a bit of background info: I\u2019m currently on swallowed fluticasone to see if that can reduce the inflammation in my esophagus to let me body heal/reduce the strictures I have mid esophagus. I had an endoscopy end of December to check on progress and it wasn\u2019t having much luck. However, in January my blood work showed my eosinophils were down slightly!! I usually sit around 1.1-1.3 on my blood work. I\u2019m waiting to see a dietician but the waitlist here is very long. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m worried because I have a fear of hospitals and doctors (great combination with this disorder, right?). My gallbladder also releases too much bile causing bile mediated reflux (no clue what that actually means I just take sulcrate for it). When I eat sometimes I get ridiculous stomach pain, and when I eat lately it feels like things are getting stuck more often than they used to even though I\u2019m following the treatment regimen. I had a piece of a burger stuck in my throat for what felt like almost an hour, and drinking didn\u2019t help it go down I just kept gagging. I\u2019m losing weight too because it takes so long to eat and when I do eat things get stuck or I sometimes end up in extreme pain (8/10 or higher). I\u2019ve lost 12 pounds in about a month. I\u2019m worried that if I can\u2019t get the weight loss under control and if I go to the ER with food stuck they\u2019ll admit me due to the inability to control my pain combined with the weight loss. I\u2019ve had bad experiences with hospitals and I get panic attacks when I have to go to emerge so I try to avoid it at all costs. I was wondering what the likelihood of that happening would be or if anyone could share their experiences with going to emerge for these symptoms (or similar ones) so that I can put my mind at ease that it won\u2019t be as scary as I think it might be if I do have to go. My GI is really good with trying to calm me down when I do have to go to the hospital for endoscopy, he works with me to make sure I\u2019m okay and he performs the procedure himself so he\u2019s able to be very personable and talk me down prior to the start of it. I\u2019m just worried about when he\u2019s not there.

I apologize if I am completely off base...I am having a hard time understand what eoe is, I just read that it is a \"delayed food allergy\".\n\nI haven't slept in weeks because I am so worried about him and he soils himself every night and chokes on his vomit so i just sit and watch him. We have to change sheets/give a bath twice a night. \n\nHis Ped just keeps saying it is a stomach bug but he has had no fever ever or looked \"under the weather\" he just can't hold any food down. We also went to an allergist for the first time on Monday and they also said it was unrelated. Blood tests came back today that he has no infections and everything appears normal. Separate from that, other bloodwork showed an allergy to beef, pork, and dairy. We were not able to speak to the allies about this as he left for the holiday weekend.\n\nSorry if I didn't give enough detail, I am trying to keep it short.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 580, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is this eoe?

I\u2019m so happy I found this subreddit. I am 22(f) and was diagnosed with EOE this past August. I was presenting with severe abdominal pain after eating, persistent vomiting, trouble swallowing, and about a 10 pound weight loss. I saw my gastro who ordered a series of tests including an endoscopy. When I woke up from the procedure, he informed me he couldn\u2019t pass the endoscope because my esophagus was about 6mm (normal is like 20mm I think?)\n\nHe did take a biopsy which confirmed EOE (I had like 120 eosinophils per. HPF, crazy). A few weeks later I was dilated and I also was put on swallowed Flovent for about 3 months. I eliminated dairy, egg, soy, wheat, fish, and alcohol (I have always been severely allergic to nuts and never eat them, I have an epi pen) this brings us to where we are now. \n\nI\u2019m feeling great now. I truly am. But I am confused. We did additional blood tests which show I\u2019m allergic to so much. Yeast, sesame, rice, fruit, coconut, carrots, avocado, you name it. With that said, and my diet already so limited, I had to slowly bring back (one at a time) the 6 foods from the elimination diet (besides nuts, like I said) in extremely small quantities. I have not had another flare up, or any other symptoms. My main question is this: Does this mean I can have occasional cheat days on the diet? \nI am seeing my allergist next week and my gastro also agrees I can introduce things slowly one at a time to see if I can identify any triggers. It\u2019s just scary because I don\u2019t want to go into another flare up. Things were so bad over the summer. Will having these foods every now and then put me back where I was?? \n\nThanks fellow EOE friends!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1717, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "First Time Posting Here", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/jt2uze/first_time_posting_here/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SaRaHD0721", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_89u5lshh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605150652, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/jsmym2/knowledge/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jsmym2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/jsmym2/knowledge/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1605150663, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was diagnosed with EOE 2 years ago now and pretty much discovered my trigger right away.

Could be my mind though. \n\nRegardless, I'm laying off soy for a few days and will try it again to see if I get the same reaction. \n\nThanks.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1699, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Soy", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/jqr6u9/soy/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ScriScriz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_67tch5y6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1604803794, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/jq42en/elimination_diet/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jq42en", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/jq42en/elimination_diet/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1604803805, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello all just started the elimination diet, doing dairy first.

I just had my first endoscopy and the biopsy came back as \"questionable for eosinophilic esophagitis.\"  I honestly don't think I have it, or if I do it's a super mild case, but my doctor wants to treat it anyway and see how it goes.  So I've been prescribed a budesonide nebulizer suspension to make as a slurry and have it coat my esophagus, 2 mg twice daily for 8 weeks.  \n\nFor anyone who has taken it, did you experience side effects?  The handout from my doctor said that it isn't absorbed like regular steroids (i.e. prednisone) so it wouldn't cause anything.  I'm still anxious though because I'm very sensitive to steroids and can't tolerate more than a few days of them.  I get heart issues and such.  I'm also terrified of weight gain as I'm recovering from an eating disorder and have a lot of body image issues right now.  \n\nI'd love to hear about your experiences and if taking this drug felt like taking a typical oral steroid.

I noticed alot of people asking for advice or for help on here and I thought that posting my experiences with EoE and Anaphylaxis would help someone out. Sorry for any of my grammar or spelling mistakes.\n\nFirst of all, if you ever feel pain in your mouth after eating something, and maybe your tongue feels like it's burning, swelling, or maybe even electricity is running through it, seek immediate medical attention from professionals. Those are the signs I had when I accidentally eat pumpkin seeds. It takes less than 30 seconds for me to know when I'm about to go into shock. It triggers my EoE and in 5 minutes I will be shaking, vomiting if I can, and everything else. \n\nIf that happens to you and you end up at a hospital like I was, they'll probably give you steroids and a liquid form of benedryl and an IV. You have to tell them you have EoE if you can. After you get out, go see an allergist, aa PCP or whatever, make sure to get a prescription for an EpiPen. I use an off brand EpiPen because they're cheaper than the name brand. Use GoodRx app for discounts too.\n\nEoE can trigger anaphylactic reactions. It does for me if I even lick a pumpkin seed. I have had pumpkin seeds one time and didn't have to go to the hospital, which was a huge risk because I might have been worse off. It happened when I ate a Bear Naked granola bite and didn't realize it have pumpkin seeds. I rushed home in my car, (literally 25 minutes from my old job) and safely and quickly as I could while making a mess in the driver's side floorboard and all over myself. That happened this year when I didn't have health insurance. I couldn't afford to see a hospital. But I had an EpiPen and I took a few benedryl tablets, chewing them, because my EoE triggers on many medications. After taking the epipen i had to wait for 20 minutes to make sure i was okay, if not, take it again, and then suck it up and go to the hospital. Luckily I was okay, I managed to detect the seeds before i got too many in me.\n\nBut don't wait and see if you'll feel better. Allegra D also triggered my EoE, the first time I ever took it. I couldn't swallow anything for 5-6 hours that day. The doctors had to pulverize the pill while it was still inside my throat because it wouldn't get poked down or sucked out. The pill started to burn my throat too. I got lucky that day as well but with no insurance, I am still paying for that visit. \n\nIt'll feel like your choking, unable to swallow but you can still breathe. Below is a list of my allergies and symptoms. Make sure you know the signs, talk to a doctor/allergist about your condition. My allergist told me today they had no way of testing for pumpkin seeds, and to avoid them (duh). They said the EoE is not very well understood and that omeprazole helps most people with under lying conditions like acid reflux or heart burn, which I get sometimes even if I just drink water.\n\n1. Pumpkin seeds (anaphylactic shock in seconds)\n2. Eggs. (Sore, itchy throat, hiccups sometimes, lots of salivating, swelling of the throat)\n3. Bananas (see eggs)\n4. Avocado (diarrhea, nausea, head aches, itchy and sore throat)\n5. Tuna (like eggs but with more throat swelling)\n6. Almonds (dry itchy mouth and throat, skin irritation)\n7. Peanuts (skin irritation)\n8. Soy (skin irritation)\n9. Cinnamon (the smell, if it's too strong will make my nose bleed and eyes water, but i can eat it just fine... for now)\n10. Allegra D and other medicines (triggers EoE SUPER aggressively.)\n11. Seasonal allergies (itchy, water eyes, itchy throat, etc)\n12.

My most recent endoscopy showed no eosinophils in the biopsy which is odd because I still have symptoms and my esophagus is narrow all throughout.  I've never experienced an anaphylactic reaction before and my only known allergens are cat hair and rye grass (determined by a skin prick test 10 years ago). I've been avoiding wheat and suspect foods for quite some time now. While dairy doesn't give me too many issues, gluten tends to give me symptoms of Oral Allergy Syndrome and trouble swallowing so I try to stay away from it as much as I can. I've been wheat free for a few years. Trace amounts in products that may contain it doesn't typically bother me.\n\nYesterday evening, I accidentally ate a pastry that contained wheat in it. A few minutes later, I started experiencing a tingling/slightly numb sensation in the roof of my mouth towards the back of my throat. I thought this was just because of the cinnamon in the pastry, but then realized there was more to it when my throat started feeling like it was on fire while taking a few gulps of water. Literally 30 seconds later, I felt some tightness in my throat and had difficulty swallowing. My chest ached and felt itchy all at once. Then lastly, my stomach started hurting very suddenely and I started sweating. I was terrified I was getting an anaphylactic reaction and before I knew it, I was having a panic attack. I had some difficulty catching my breath, but I attributed this to my anxiety. After about 20-30 minutes of hell, I finally managed to calm myself down. Swallowing became a little easier 45 min later and the tightness in my throat disappeared by the 1 hour mark. The stomach pain and chest discomfort also disappeared 2 hours later. I had very mild shortness of breath for the rest of the evening that might've just been anxiety, but I'm not 100% sure. No rashes or hives as far as I'm aware.. Although my mom pointed out that my neck was red at some point. Anyway, 12 hours later, I'm feeling completely fine, but now I'm questioning whether I just experienced symptoms of a typical wheat allergy or a more severe anaphylactic reaction that went away on its own. I do not have an epipen and did not have benadryl on hand. What should I do from now on if this ever happens again?

I\u2019m on mobile so sorry if formatting is weird, and the post is a bit long so apologies for that as well. I (21F) got diagnosed with EoE when I was 15-16 years old, but I have been dealing with it nearly my whole life, I just didn\u2019t know what it was (I called it stomachaches, but really it was my esophagus). I still get acid reflux maybe 3 times a week, but it doesn\u2019t last very long. I was on Flovent then PPIs for my EoE and my asthma has gotten much better, so I haven\u2019t had many issues with my EoE recently. My only known allergen which flares it up is dairy, but I\u2019ve heard about people having issues with drinking alcohol. Now, I don\u2019t get acid reflux from drinking, but I constantly throw up, even if I\u2019m not feeling sick. I physically can\u2019t chug anything, not even water, and I\u2019ve heard people say things like \u201copen your throat\u201d but I physically can\u2019t do that. To be clear I don\u2019t WANT to chug my drinks, I\u2019m just saying I can\u2019t. If I drink too fast, though, I throw up, even with something with low alcohol content that I like, like wine or White Claws. Another thing I can\u2019t do is take shots as I throw up literally every time I\u2019ve tried, which isn\u2019t many as I don\u2019t like throwing up lol. It\u2019s not because I hate the taste or feel ill, like I said. I could take a single shot and it would make me puke. I still get food impacted in my throat maybe once a week, but it goes down after 5-15 mins or so. I wake up nauseous nearly every single morning, I think from acid reflux.\n\nAll that being said, I am really wondering if I should get my esophagus dilated. I am really tired of throwing up all the time and feeling nauseous all the time. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s worth it because I\u2019ve never gotten one, but I had untreated EoE for 10-15 years and I really think it would help. I don\u2019t know what a \u201cnormal\u201d esophagus is like, so I don\u2019t know if this IS normal and just an EoE thing that wouldn\u2019t go away even with a dilation. Please give me advice!

About a week ago I swallowed a tiny piece of plastic. I was chewing on one of those plastic covers that come with razor blades and a piece slid down my throat. It wasn\u2019t sharp and very tiny. I could feel it inside my throat so I panicked and decided to swallow something so it could go down. I swallowed a whole piece of banana without chewing it and I think I might have caused some damage. It didn\u2019t hurt other than a burning sensation while I swallowed it. \n\nSo when I tried to go to sleep, the banana came back up and I almost started choking. I drank some soda and this immediately made the banana go back down and I was able to go to sleep again. \n\nThe next morning the right side of my stomach was a bit swollen but it didn\u2019t hurt or anything. The swelling went down but for like the next 3 days the left side of my throat swelled up whenever I ate something. I think it might have been my lymph nodes swelling up because I felt a tightening sensation on the left side of my face and shoulder. I know for certain my thyroid was swelling up in my throat because I could feel a ball swelling up in there whenever I ate something. \n\nEventually the swelling mostly went away when eating but on Wednesday I made the mistake of eating a burger and the same thing that happened with the banana happened again when I went to sleep. I drank soda again and it helped but this time the food didn\u2019t completely go down my throat. I didn\u2019t eat anything for the next 24 hours, and after drinking lots of water and soda, the food slowly went down. \n\nLast night I ate a small amount of soup and it didn\u2019t get stuck but my throat feels very heavy and swollen. I couldn\u2019t sleep tonight because it\u2019s difficult to breathe laying down. The swelling sensation on my throat seems to flare up at night when I\u2019m trying to sleep. \n\nShould I go to urgent care and get my throat checked out? It feels really tight right now I\u2019m so anxious and exhausted.

I was hoping it would help me so I wouldn't have to do this diet that didn't even seem to help my symptoms that much.\n\nMy doctor told me I can try and see if I can tolerate wheat since I'm not Celiac (blood and endoscopy confirmed).

Is happens every time I eat. Usually drinking water can force it down but sometimes it can\u2019t and I have to regurgitate the water. I am unable to throw up the food. Previously I was admitted to the ER after a dime size piece of steak was stuck for 12 hours and the endoscopy showed my esophagus had completely closed up almost like an allergic reaction but it wasn\u2019t. Doctors diagnosed me with EOE and Gerd and prescribed omeprazole which did not help. I rarely deal with acid reflux and I\u2019m starting to wonder if this was a misdiagnosis.

I will be back in US during July (before 2nd endoscopy) and could push for referral that I probably wouldn't get, but I could try.\n* I also have anxiety/depression that could be exacerbated by health issues but also is pretty consistent. Anyone else on an SSRI with this or hear anything about it helping or contraindications? I don't like taking a ton of meds, but it also might be best for me in order to take care of myself. \n* Before all the health stuff popped up, I'd been trying to get pregnant. Perfect timing!

He has it severely enough that any time an upper endoscopy has to be performed, they have to use a pediatric scope because he has such a narrow esophagus, and tells me that any time he has one done, it's a guaranteed visit to the ER due to pain that follows about 24 hours later. He does not follow any special diets and sometimes treats with Budesonide (he takes the liquid stuff straight, doesn't mix with anything, and absolutely despises the stuff), and to my knowledge only has environmental allergies like pollen from most trees (went from zero allergies to allergic to most pollens from trees around where we live). He keeps track of what reliably gets stuck and either avoids foods or eats them very carefully (reheated white rice seems to be an especially bad culprit, but freshly-made is okay as long as it's not too sticky). I don't remember specifically when he was diagnosed, but I believe it was in his mid-teens. We're both in our late-20s now. \n\nI know that EoE is a relatively recently-named and identified condition, so not much is really known about it yet, let alone reliable treatments. In occasional casual talks with my partner about possible future child(ren), he's not sure about it almost entirely because of his EoE and potentially/likely passing it along based on his family's history. His mother has it, as does his brother, but he himself has it the worst in his family by far from what I understand. He does not have any sisters. My family doesn't have a history of anything like this nor any food allergies. From what little I've found, males are like 3x as likely to develop it compared to females. Other than that, I haven't been able to find much information (if any at all) about potential inheritance risks, just information on diagnosing a child showing symptoms, symptoms later in life, anecdotes, etc. \n\nIs this something a genetic counselor can speculate if we wanted to talk to one in the future? Or would we truly be rolling the dice and hoping for the best? I'm not looking to potentially have a child any time soon, but I'm approaching the age 30-35 window quickly (and personally don't want to be starting to try, if we do, closer to 40), so decisions would have to be made one way or another within the next few years (due to medications on my side I'd ideally have to stop taking to achieve this, it would have to be planned).

By the time the ambulance got here I thought I felt good enough to just ride to the hospital.  10 minutes into the drive I had my wife pull over jumped out of the car before she could put it in park throwing up again and passing out face first in a puddle of blood, terrifying my wife as I laid on the side of the road limp bowels evacuated with blood running out of my mouth.\n\nGot to the hospital and once they finally were able to scope they ended up finding a Mallory Weiss tear, a bleeding ulcer, and an about to rupture blood vessel. Dr told my wife it was critical I didn't vomit until healed and that had I one more time before they got to me bleeding to death would have been an extremely real possibility. \n\nI spent 13 years of not taking this serious and hadn't felt symptoms in maybe 6 years and it bit me in the ass.

I have struggled for many years with various symptoms and never had a proper diagnosis, but stumbling across some research on EE and what I'm seeing is the closest to what I've experienced. But I had a couple questions that I thought I might ask that might help me articulate what I'm experiencing to my doctor.\n\nFor about five years, I've thought I've had issues with my upper digestive tract. It came upon me one spring/summer -- abdominal spasms each night, reflux-like symptoms, labored breathing \\[but not in a \"I'm running out of air\" way\\]. I've been on PPis ever since but I think they're more placebo than anything else. \n\nThe thing is, it tends to get noticeably bad in spring/summer and go away in the winter. I've struggled throughout my life with esophageal problems -- usually with dysphagia and feeling like food is caught, but in high school I had an episode of extreme spasming and couldn't eat solid food for about four months. I had an endoscopy and the doctor only found dysmotility, but this was about twenty years ago and I don't recall them ever suggesting EE so I'm not sure if they would've been checking for this.\n\nanyway, it strikes me as odd that my symptoms should present at a time of year when allergies are known to be exceptionally bad and subside to a noticeable degree in late fall and winter. I see a lot of posts here discussing food allergies and elimination diets, so I'm not sure if EE is related strictly to food or if it can be influenced by seasonal allergies.\n\nSo I suppose my questions are threefold:\n\n* Is it possible for a doctor to perform an endoscopy and miss EE if it's not something they're actively looking for? Would a doctor twenty years ago have been aware of this or known to look for it?\n* Do any of you experience symptoms that resemble a digestive disorder? Were any of you misdiagnosed with GERD?\n* Is EE always a food allergy or can seasonal allergies \\[ie grass pollen, tree pollen, mold, etc\\] trigger flare ups?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2239, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Early questions about EE from someone who may finally have a name for what's been going on", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ndfkr1/early_questions_about_ee_from_someone_who_may/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "108daffodils", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6qckq5u", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1621054792, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ncr6b3/elimination_diet_substitutions_bread_cheese/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ncr6b3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ncr6b3/elimination_diet_substitutions_bread_cheese/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1621054803, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m starting the 4-food elimination diet on Monday and I\u2019m wondering what (if anything) you substitute for bread and dairy (cheese &amp; sour cream in particular) if you\u2019re avoiding wheat and dairy? \n\nAre there particular things you\u2019ve found to be reliably similar and satisfying enough to have instead, or do I just need to get used to the idea these things no longer exist to me? \n\nLike if I want a sandwich, what am I doing for bread?

Just nothing is working and I'm here telling my story in hopes that someone has unfortunately been through something similar. \n\nI was diagnosed with EoE last year when I had a colonoscopy/endoscopy for other reasons. At the time, it wasn't a big deal but I had some dysphagia every now and then but it was never severe. As of 6 months ago, it started getting worse and I had a lot more trouble swallowing. Things were more often getting stuck in my throat but I could usually get it to come up or go down. Until this past Thursday night. when I was eating steak tacos. I had already cut the steak up unbelievably small. and somehow it still got stuck and I couldn't get it to move. I could breathe but I couldn't get any liquids including my own saliva past it. I went to the ER and got IV meds (glucagon plus reglan) to relax my esophagus and then they had me try to chug a soda and jump really hard. this actually worked the second time after I spit soda all over everything the first time. \n\nAt this point, Id already had an endoscopy scheduled where my dr was going to stretch my esophagus. So that happened on Monday at 11am. I have had endoscopies before and was assured that even with this dilation procedure, it was super common and routine and I could eat/drink whatever afterwards. I was so excited to be able to eat normally again. After I had it, they gave me apple juice and I told them that it hurt really bad when it went down into my chest. The nurse said yes, your throat may be a little sore. I tried to tell her it wasn't my throat like she was talking about and she brushed me off. I let her bc I just assumed it would be fine in a few hours. I got home and I couldn't eat or drink anything without extreme pain in my lower chest area. My throat doesn't hurt at all. doesn't hurt to talk or anything. but there is a very sharp burning/squeezing pain that is just really extreme when it gets to a certain point in my chest. It literally brings me to tears. So I decided to take a nap and slept for 3 hours. It still wasn't better after this so I called the after hours line at my GI dr. They said go straight to the ER bc it sounded like a perforation. At the ER (this is Monday night) they gave me a GI cocktail (Mylanta and lidocaine I think it is) and morphine twice bc the first dose wasn't high enough. I can sometimes get the pain even without eating or drinking. None of this worked. They did a CT scan and x-rays. They didn't find a perforation so they gave me IV fluids bc I was very dehydrated and sent me home with rx for valium (to relax my esophagus) and sucralfate (something that apparently should coat my esophagus). Neither of these worked so I called my GI office back and the nurse spoke with my dr and told me they sent a GI cocktail script to my pharmacy. That should work but if it doesn't to call back in the am. That didn't work of course so I called back this morning at 8am and its now noon. I haven't eaten or drank anything since Sunday night at 9pm except for the few sips of water I force myself to get through for meds. I'm so freaking hungry and my mouth is so dry. I don't know what to do anymore.\n\nBoth my GI dr and my allergist tell me that there is not enough info about EoE to have answers to most of my questions. and that's before this happened. Idk what they will do when they call me back. Has anyone had this experience? Any insight is much appreciated.

The strictures were so bad that my GI actually had to use an infant tube to get down into my stomach lol.\n\nAnd the ulcers are not caused by H Pylori or NSAIDs, so why I get ulcers are a mystery.

My husband isn\u2019t a Redditor but he\u2019s been newly diagnosed with EE and I feel like it\u2019s been a long process of waiting around for answers and help. It all started last year after a piece of steak got lodged in his throat and he turned white as a ghost. I failed miserably at performing the Heimlich maneuver (and I\u2019m a critical care nurse!) and watched in agony as he beat himself up until the steak became dislodged. After that, it seemed choking on everything during every meal became a common occurrence and I urged him to get scoped. \n\nBecause of covid, the wait times for diagnosis have been long. After his scope last year (in which eosinophils where present), they diagnosed him with GERD. Well protonix didn\u2019t help at all and the choking became worse. Finally got him back in the office this year, got another scope done, new diagnosis of EE. Doctor put him on Flovent this time around. Just went back today because that doesn\u2019t seem to be doing anything either and now we\u2019re waiting to hear back from the local pharmacy regarding the Budesonide slurry order.\n\nIn the meantime, we also booked an appointment with a specialist for a second opinion back in February, but he wants an allergy test done. That\u2019s still upcoming, allergist was booked through til May. \n\nToday during dinner with friends, my husband had to run from the table to the kitchen sink because he was choking again. I am horrified one of these days it\u2019s not going to end well and I\u2019m going to be doing CPR on him. He\u2019s not too concerned, just annoyed.

It\u2019s been over 5 years and it\u2019s changed my entire life in ways I didn\u2019t think it would. I thought well if I lived with until now what would it change, it started with the restrictions. They put me on the 6 main allergy elimination diet dairy, soy, nuts, egg, wheat, and fish. I kept with this for 6 months but found a more troubling problem. I felt like I could eat less and less, meals I had eaten or tried too often would become a restriction, as I\u2019d grown \u201csick\u201d of them. After 6 months I realized my bigger triggers that had clear effects were eggs, soy, and dairy. Another 6 months of this diet and by the end I was losing weight and not eating every other day. \n\nI chose that I would rather be nauseous then anorexic, I went back to eating anything thay I was able to keep down because at least I was eating. My last 5 years have been this crazy repeat action about finding my \u201csafe foods\u201d things that I will eat obsessively because it doesn\u2019t trigger me. \n\nI have stopped working because I had been unable to be a reliable employee and I was hospitalized from dehydration on 3 accounts.

EoE has turned into some monster that controls every aspect of my life. \n\nI am getting a nutritionist but they always ask \u201cwhat can you eat?\u201d\u201dwhat can\u2019t you eat\u201d  I don\u2019t know how to answer those questions any more. \n\nI wake up sick, I\u2019m sick all day, and I can\u2019t sleep because I\u2019m sick. \n\nIt\u2019s turned into this mess of trigger food and never eating enough and trying to pick one.

Wanted to share what I think is my remission success story after having been diagnosed EOE 5 years ago at age 17 and now at age 23 and one year(plus) with no meds and no symptoms, and I\u2019m pretty sure no change in diet! I\u2019m on no restrictions and I eat whatever I want without food getting stuck! Hopefully others can relate but I don\u2019t quite have a cure I think that worked completely for me however I do think that this is a common occurrence because of what my doctor said! And will keep this updated in case my symptoms come back ever! Fingers crossed.\n\nHad trouble eating from a young age, and finally it got worse and worse until I had a piece of food get stuck one night. Was able to pass after an hour+ of not being able to swallow my own saliva without throwing it up.\n\nHad an endoscopy with a specialist in this field (esophagus) and the doctor said I had a textbook case of EOE, in fact the inflammation and white cells (forgive me for lack of term syntax) were so bad that the camera chord couldn\u2019t fit. This started a few years on and off of a daily steroid solution that coats my throat as I swallow it (budesonide) and food restrictions I went on. I\u2019ve tried allergy tests, been on a few 6-month/3-month elimination diets to isolate from things like wheat, dairy, eggs and fish ect as instructed by my doc. Basically the only thing that came back positive through this was the allergy test which showed a minor allergy to maple pollen. \n\nOnly the budesonide worked for me. The pharmacy was instructed by the doctor to make it into a thick viscous solution so that it can coat my throat. I was on and off this for a few years until I had to get a new doctor (due to location change) and he told me that in many of the cases he\u2019s seen, EOE went away for them as they grew up. He said most people he\u2019s dealt with \u201cgrow out of it\u201d. And I think that is what happened with me unless there is some other variable that I missed. It is also quite possible that there could be SOMETHING I\u2019m no longer eating anymore but I\u2019ve tried to isolate this with my parents and my diets been pretty much the same for years! We\u2019ve tried thinking of other possibilities, remember that maple pollen allergy I had ect. (Symptoms have been good for months already since the summer before covid even hit)\n\nSo onto the present time, I\u2019ve been one year plus off the budesonide (I usually go on cycles of this when my symptoms come back). In fact, I had another endoscopy somewhere around that time and the doctor noted that the condition was much better, I cannot remember the exact details but he said the cells were far fewer than before. And somehow, ever since, it\u2019s as if it\u2019s totally disappeared. There are still times where food gets partially stuck and I just gotta take a quick sip of water and it clears so I know it\u2019s still partially there but I have no idea why my symptoms have stopped and haven\u2019t changed now for so long! My eating is far better than I can ever remember whereas before, I would get food stuck often. \n\nWill keep you guys updated if it comes back, but I am eating whatever I want whenever I want, and I guess if it does come back, I will try budesonide again! FYI I was also prescribed an acid blocker alongside the budesonide to help with the heartburn  I think. \n\nTake my story however you guys want but this was my story and I really hope it might help others, or give reassurance to a few. Maybe my doctor was right in that you might just outgrow it? I really don\u2019t know but I\u2019m not complaining and have no scheduled future date set right now with my doctor! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments and I\u2019ll try to get back!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2165, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Six year remission story", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/mvuph3/six_year_remission_story/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "plormfu", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9pe4lbfy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1619002481, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/mvd3pn/sore_throat_only_symptom/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mvd3pn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/mvd3pn/sore_throat_only_symptom/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1619002492, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was diagnosed with EoE last month, all began 5 months ago after a viral infection.

I posted my EOE story previously and found posts on this subreddit very helpful. So I thought I would share what I've learned since because multiple conditions with overlapping symptoms can be very confusing and it feels great to understand them at last.\n\nLike many people I found symptoms very confusing. After a first elimination test I thought incorrectly that wheat was my trigger because removing it from my diet helped me very much. I suspected everything from food to tap water, old dental fillings and fertilizers. Symptoms ranged from impacting food to acid reflux, irritability and constant burping.\n\nBurping helped crack the case. On this subreddit somebody posted about how digestive enzymes help the body digest food it otherwise cannot, as a result of which it produced the gas I was burping. I tried some vegan digestive enzymes and they worked. Burping stopped. That led me to investigate a little further and learned it was a common symptom of gluten intolerance. I spoke to family and learned that some cousins, an aunt and a grandmother were all Celiacs. I removed gluten, stopped taking the digestive enzymes and found the burping, the acid reflux and much of the irritability did not return.\n\nA few months later I was still experiencing impacting food and irritability sometimes. We noticed a pattern that I would become irritable in the days after food with eggs (omelettes, fritatta and gluten free cakes). So I decided to repeat the elimination diet. The result: goodbye eggs.\n\nSo life without eggs and gluten is good, a little tricky with kids, but very good. Confusion cleared up.

Before this period, I was allergen free, aside from a mild hayfever now and then and to chocolate. During this period of 4 years I swallowed aerosol corticosteroids for a brief time (which helped) and I took 40mg PPI for this entire period in time. I had a blood-allergy test which came up negative and an allergy test where they inject tiny amounts of 32 allergens. A mild case of 'birch cross- allergy' came up, but this was of no concern according to the allergist.\n\nFast forward in time: The food impactions came back. I went backt to the GE and he proposed the FFED (four food elimination diet of wheat/milk/soy/eggs). I have been on the FFED for 8 months now under supervision of this GE and a dietician. Every time after about 7-8 weeks I got a new endoscopy where they took biopsies to check for eosinophiles.\n\nThe first round where I eliminated all four foods came up 'clean' and allergen free. This was a good start. After this, sadly, wheat and eventually milk came up 'positive' for eosinophiles. \n\nThe last stretch the dietician proposed that we provoke egg &amp; soy at the same time. She said it has never happend before that there are more than 2 food groups that are the culprits. \n\nDuring this soy&amp;egg period I developed OAS (oral allergy syndrome which causes your mouth, lips, cheek and gum to swell) which was provoked by sesame and mustard at first, with a heavy reaction. Later on fruit and raw lettuce as well. I had never experienced this before. I have a mild hay-fever and get itchy arms if I lay in grass, but I never experienced something like this. Naturally I eliminated mustard and sesame as well from the diet.\n\nUnfortunately today I received the news that egg and soy were culprits as well.\n\nI'm a bit at loss here and had to vent a bit. The dietician says this is rare and she is at loss as well. I proposed a recap of milk, without wheat, soy, eggs and nuts to rule out any small mistakes that I may have made the previous period. These 8 months were pretty hard on me, especially since I couldn't really add anything.\n\nThanks for hearing me out.

My GI doctor recommended I work with an allergist, but also tried prescribing me flovent for a month to try to reduce the swelling in my throat. I think I flubbed using it for awhile, weak presses and a whole bunch of other gaffs before I got the hang of it. But by the end, I felt the noticable difference swallowing.\n\nI started an elimination diet around the same time. Starting with soy as my soy intake jumped up when I stopped eating meat. After I stopped the inhaler, even with soy out the symptoms came back so now dairy is added to the list.\n\nWhat I'm having a hard time gauging is how to interpret symptoms. My most recent flare up was about a week ago. I was eating a frozen amy's burrito, no dairy, no soy. I got a huge lump feeling in my throat and swallowing was really hard. How am I supposed to interpret that? Does that mean that something in the burrito was the trigger? Was it a coincidence and it was actually something I ate earlier/ the day before? I know the onset can be sudden.\n\nAnd the first symptom I ever remember feeling, was when I would smoke weed at night (usually concentrate vape) and eating pita chips and hummus. Today that seems to be mixed. Can weed be a factor? Maybe just hot stuff in my throat can be agitating things. Maybe it's something in pita chips or hummus? \n\nI'm only on 2 food elimination and I'm already losing it, I've read so much tonight about people doing 6/7 foods for months, and while I'm impressed, good God I can't imagine doing that. \n\nI just don't know how to understand my reactions.

Around an hour of difficult breathing, a chest x-ray, two blood tests, and a blackout scare later, I felt \"suddenly fine\", and the doctors there called it a \"panic attack\" and sent me home.\n\nWhen I got out, I went back home and had some leftover pizza, which caused me to choke and panic for a few seconds.  I had complained of feeling like I were choking a few times before and brushed this off as \"eating too fast\".\n\nTwo days later, while eating out with my parents, I felt the choking sensation again, but it lasted much much longer.  This time, a strong \"burning\" lingered at the top of my throat, something like stomach acid had managed to get up to my neck. \n I decided that it was not going away fast enough and went back to the ER again with similar results, but this time they gave me a \"GI cocktail\" and a prescription for Xanax.\n\nI went back to university the following day, and upon attempting to eat yogurt on an empty stomach, felt the burning in my throat do badly that I had to stop.  I called my doctor and explained what was happening and was told to go to a different hospital to get some new tests done.  One of the tests was an esophagram, where I would swallow barium to see if my esophagus is misshapen (the tests say it looked \"normal\").  This ER doctor told me to see a GI specialist, which I did some time later, and a prescription for pantoprozole (finally, we're getting somewhere) to help with my assumed stomach acid problems.\n\nI saw a GI specialist the earliest I could, around a week later.  This GI specialist walked into the room and opened with \"you do realize you have gallstones, right?\"  No, I absolutely didn't realize I had gallstones.  It turns out that my appendicitis visit to the ER some 9 months earlier had a CT scan report saying \"large mass in gall bladder, probably gallstones\", and I was not told this or given a copy of the report.  He told me that I would need to get it removed eventually, but first needed an ultrasound and an EGD so make sure nothing else is wrong.\n\nAt this point, I'm on a predominantly liquid diet, as I cannot seem to get any solid food down comfortably.  I get the ultrasound and the EGD around a week later, within one day of each other.  The ultrasound came first, and the results were immediate and a bit depressing - everything looked fine.  Now, normally I would have been really excited, except that I was not getting better at all.  Still the same shortness of breath, severe difficulty swallowing (let alone eating), burning in the throat, and new and not-so-improved liquid diet.\n\nThe EGD goes smoothly, except that the doctor doing the EGD tells me after the fact (and also once I'm conscious) that I have a few rings in my throat, some \"furrowing\" and areas of concentrated inflammation, one of which he expanded.  He apparently took a biopsy in those two places because he thinks that I have EoE.\n\nA few days later, I get a call from him himself saying that my eosinophil count was below the EoE threshold and that I definitely did not have EoE.  (Almost had it)  He said it was probably GERD, and told me to continue to take my medicine and call in a week.\n\nOf course, nothing was significantly better after a week, and to be quite frank, I really hated not having any confirmed diagnosis because I just wanted some treatment.  I called a week later and told him this, and he prescribed me Baclofen (smooth tissue relaxer? Muscle relaxer? I got two different definions of this.) thrice daily.  It was also around this time that I went to the ER again with a caper (the really small nutty things) and get glucogon (spelling?) to get it down.\n\nThings still weren't really any better (hoo boy I sure love it when a pill gets temporarily lodged in my throat), and so I called again, and the GI specialist told me to take the Pantoprozole twice a day instead of once a day.  I also was told to get a manometry study (which honestly was one of the absolutely most unpleasant experiences ever imo), which came back normal.  It's early December, and things have gotten a little bit worse.  I'm now almost entirely on liquids (at least comfortably) and have had a few instances of being woken to the short-lived sensation of not breathing at all (I still don't know if this was related.).  I call again during finals week, and the doctor tells me to go see my primary doctor.\n\nAnd so I see my primary care physician, and upon pulling up my records and listening to the mess of the last two months, pops off and says that he hates what this GI specialist is doing.  My doctor says that I without a doubt have EoE, and that biopsy results sometimes miss the mark.  He wants to treat it as if it were EoE prescribes me Flovent and claims that this is guaranteed to work \n Within a week, I'm feeling the best I've felt in two months and back to eating solid food (with some difficulty, of course, but Jesus at least I'm eating...).\n\nI've since seen a new GI specialist and an allergist who have confirmed the diagnosis of EoE and been extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  I'm off of the Baclofen (thank God, that was shockingly expensive) and on a two-food elimination diet, but I lost 10 pounds in the two months without a diagnosis.  I'm not perfect yet, but I can finally eat a reasonable pace and eat substantial amounts of food.\n\nTl;dr - ignored some choking, wrong, wrong again, wrong, right but passed off, wrong, finally treated for EoE and magically felt good\n\nHas anyone else had trouble with diagnosis?

Here's a summary of my situation. Hoping this is helpful to someone.\n\n**Allergies**\n\nFrom about age 20 to 30 I had allergic reactions to lots of fruit, some veggies, and some nuts - the kinds of food allergies that are commonly tied to seasonal allergies. When I ate these things, my cheeks would itch and swell. Worse reactions would make my esophagus swell to the point where it felt like someone was squeezing it. It was quite painful. At that point I'd have to go find some Benadryl or wait an hour for the waves of fiery burning to subside.\n\nAfter age 30, my allergies started to clear up significantly. I still avoid these foods, but I can eat them sometimes without too much issues. Although now I believe they are still impacting my esophagus.\n\n**Symptoms / Progression**\n\nI started getting very bad acid reflux around 28. I was eating poorly at the time... lots of pizza, pop, and juice. Cutting that stuff out helped a lot, but based on symptoms, I thought I might have had an ulcer... wasn't sure. I never went to the doctor about this. It lasted about a year and feels like it's mostly cleared up.\n\nI've always had trouble minor trouble swallowing. Every time this would happen, I would drink water and flush it down. I ate mini-wheats most mornings for like a year at 29-30 which is when things started to get worse. One time I was trying my water trick and it wouldn't go down. So I was patiently waiting (as I was essentially forcing myself to sit through choking noises/gulping motions). Then I realized I needed to breath *but couldn't*... which was scary. Went on all fours, regurgitated what I could and took a *very* laboured/blocked breath. So scary. I think I could have died. My wife saw this... she has since been very worried.\n\nSince then it's progressively gotten worse. I used to be able to swallow pills with ease, but now those green gel Advil's are my limit, and only if I take them with mayo.\n\n**Coping Strategies / Things I've Learned**\n\n* If you ever feel like you can't breath. Stop what you're doing and get stuff out asap. Do *not* worry about social norms. Living is more important than dealing with an embarrassing situation.\n\n* Learn to burp with just swallowing air. I feel this has given me more control over my stomach/esophagus which helps me deal with blockages.\n\n* Lube is key. Even drinking some water before meals is helpful. For me, mayo is the best.\n\n* Come up with a personal strategy to solve blockages. For me, I bring some water to the bathroom. Drink a little, and regurgitate (and repeat). I don't believe a full vomit reflex is needed - regurgitation works fine. My blockage is close to the stomach so a lot of other food often fills up above it without me noticing. Once the other food/liquid is out and only the blockage remains, it often goes away on it's own. The next escalation step is to continue regurgitation with just the water. Next step is to go eat some mayo and wait. I haven't had to go into the emergency yet. I figure it's just a matter of time though...\n\n* Watch your foods. Texture is killer. French fries, chicken, mini-wheats, and tortillas are all very tough foods to eat.\n\n* Learn to listen to your esophagus. I can often tell when I'm at risk of getting stuff stuck. Water often helps clear this up.\n\n**Runs in the Family**\n\nMy brother started getting symptoms at around 13? I remember thinking he just couldn't figure out how to swallow and he should just drink some water. He was diagnosed with EoE around this time.\n\nIf I remember right, one of the options the doctor presented him was to puncture a hole through his stomach where a feeding tube would go. Luckily he didn't do this. Maybe I can convince him to share his story here.\n\n**What's next**\n\nI haven't been diagnosed yet. I have an appointment with a gastrologist coming up because my wife is very concerned that I am going to choke and die. I haven't choked since, so I'm not nearly as worried.\n\nOpen question - what are you guys thoughts on surgery? My brother has mixed thoughts.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 504, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My EoE Situation", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/a86xyb/my_eoe_situation/"}, {"author": "atticpanic", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_nt0lk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1545364553, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/a86306/diagnosed_but_thats_it/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "a86306", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/a86306/diagnosed_but_thats_it/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1545364554, "score": 1, "selftext": "About 2 years ago, I had a scope and biopsy done, the results showed EoE.

I have felt so alone for a long time. My story started when I was 8 years old and I noticed I couldn't eat my food as fast as my brothers. I thought it was normal at the time. It wasn't until about y years later when I was at a NFL football game eating nachos when I turned go my dad and said \"dad I can't swallow my food, I literally can't swallow.\" I took a drink and was fine for the rest of the day. No more problems up until I was at an Orioles game with a friend and his family when once again I started choking on my food. I was rushed to the hospital and they said nothing was wrong and it was all in my head and to go on a liquid diet. From that day on it took me an hour go finish any meal. Since I had been hospitalized 3 or 4 times. I had a nose surgery done because they thought it was a sinus issue which did nothing and finally I went to the GO doctor. Biopsy was done with no dilation and was diagnosed. The medications have done nothing, allergy results showed I was allergic to many foods. The diet change has not helped and I feel lost and terrified of my future. I have to drink 2 or 3 beers a day to help me get the food down because that is the only thing that can help me eat anymore. I am now down to 125 pounds at 22 years old. CBD marijuana has just been legalized so I'm gonna try that. Has anyone had any success with CBD? I'm out of options. My allergist said the FDA is testing cures right now but who knows how long that will take.

I don't typically have trouble swallowing, but I had several \"attacks\" as I'll call them in college that I thought were just major heartburn/reflux--strong chest pains, feeling like food was trying to come up and my esophagus was burning. Typically these go away within a half hour with drinking lots of water. After a few of these, I started to recognize certain triggers and realized these were more like allergic reactions. My esophagus was tightening, not burning. There was no food coming up, it just felt that way. Typically this happened after drinking certain alcohols, mostly very hoppy beers like pale ales and IPAs. I naturally stopped drinking so much when I graduated and symptoms stopped nearly completely, but over time they built up again, both in frequency and intensity. My primary care put me on 1x daily PPI, then a different PPI (due to side effects), then 2x daily. It alleviated some symptoms but still occasionally I get some mild ones, especially after certain foods, so finally I saw a GI. Did a scope and although my esophagus looked completely normal, the biopsy was very strong for EOE as my GI expected. Great, finally some progress!\n\nHere's where I have issues. I am fully on board with this being at least partially food allergy related, but the trouble is the allergy/ies is/are strange and fleeting, and neither my GI or my allergist will take my experience into account when it comes to pinpointing it. Sometimes I'll eat a food and my esophagus will shut so badly I can barely drink water. Then another time I'll eat the same food and have no symptoms. On top of that, none of the things that give me issues fit any of the 6 major groups. Things that seem to set it off tend to fall into the category of being or containing fresh produce, especially with high water content. Lettuce, celery, and watermelon are three of the biggest culprits, for example (unfortunately these are 3 of my favorite fruits and veggies).\n\nSo i ask for advice. Has anyone ever had this type of food cause their EE symptoms (longshot for sure)? My allergist and GI seem to be pretty unhelpful and just want to bounce me back and forth for more testing on things that don't match my experience (and frankly don't make a lot of sense), and my symptoms are very mild after being on the PPI a while, is it even worth pursuing it further or should I just stay on the PPI? Should I expect my symptoms to get worse over time? Anything else I should be concerned about?

In September 2017, I began complaining of a general constant bloatedness and stomach discomfort that can only be best described as a tender feeling. Every time I would touch it, it would feel as if I had done a heap of crunches and feels as if the muscles are sore, only for it to be like this for weeks on end.\n\nDocs had put me on stemetil and a bunch of other anti-acid medication with little to no effect. The gastroscopy was the last resort for peace of mind. Visually, no indication besides some mild gastritis. \n\nI will preface by saying that I am a health anxiety sufferer since having a bad case of ill advice from a doctor who suggested I get a colonoscopy after finding blood whenever I had a bowel movement. This spiralled into suggestions that I had potentially bowel cancer due to family history. Long story short - I didn't. \n\nI have just completed almost 12 months' worth of dietary manipulation a la 6 food elimination diet. Following the below reintroduction phases:\n\nStage 1: Complete elimination of dairy, soy, eggs, wheat, seafood, nuts  \nStage 2: Reintroduction of eggs and soy  \nStage 3: Reintroduction of seafood and nuts  \nStage 4: Reintroduction of wheat  \nStage 5: Reintroduction of dairy\n\nUpon diagnosis, eosinophil count was 80+ and uniform across upper, middle and lower part of the esophagus. My first scope had shown that this had reduced down to 20+ after reintroduction of eggs and soy, before it was zero with my next scope. What was interesting was that thereafter, we were certain that perhaps wheat or dairy would likely be the culprit only to find that neither of these two were the case either!\n\nI did do some travelling back home to visit family in China prior to the initial digestive complaints and my GI has suggested that it is quite possible that the cause of EoE symptoms are very much transient. However, assuredly, what is great to hear is that I had resumed completely normal eating and my final scope and biopsy results had no suggestion of any allergic reactions whatsoever.\n\nNow, I know this may not be the case for the majority on this sub. However, I hope that this provides a bit of insight that sometimes it may not always be the most obvious based on literature. This condition is very much in its infancy stages as far as its clinical data is involved. I'm very fortunate and thankful that this is not something more permanent and I can definitely empathise with everyone who either they or their family members are going through dealing with this new condition.\n\nWhat I did learn through this process is that I have a lot more discipline than I initially thought. I believed that I would never be able to get through the diet phases without messing it up. It was a test of character and mental fortitude. Now I have self-belief that I can get through almost anything. In hindsight, many of my initial complaints could very likely have stemmed from anxiety disorder and the many physical symptoms that accompany it. Our bodies are a lot more complicated and there's still a lot to learn about it. Don't lose hope and focus on finding a cure or answers to your situation. I took matters into my own hands and was the captain of my journey. I constantly reminded myself of what outcome I was aiming to achieve and I don't regret going through this health journey one bit.\n\nI'm sorry this is a bit of a brain dump but I hope that someone finds something useful in here.

I currently take Pantoprazole and spent 8 weeks taking a Fluticasone steroid inhaler, but with little effect. My doctor decided last week to take me off Fluticasone and put me on a brand new steroid instead. It's called Jorveza here in Europe/UK, I don't know is it being used in the US at all yet. It's 1mg Budesonide in a dissolvable tab apparently (I haven't gotten the medication yet so I can't confirm the dissolvable part).\n\nHas anyone ever used this medication, or even heard of it? It's going to be very expensive because I can't get it on the NHS so I'm paying myself, and I'm a little anxious about the fact that nobody seems to have heard of it, even some pharmacists that I mentioned it to.\n\nThanks for reading, hope you're all having a pain free evening!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 419, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anyone else taking steroids?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/9w6311/anyone_else_taking_steroids/"}, {"author": "canoodlebug", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_x6wst", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541822015, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/9vrapw/terrified_of_upper_endoscopy/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9vrapw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 27, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/9vrapw/terrified_of_upper_endoscopy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1541822016, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have severe anxiety and emetophobia.

Little did I know that trip would last 24 hours including dilation procedure. Let me back track a bit. \n\nWhen I was just months old, I has a severe allergic reaction to nuts. The doctors quickly noted I had a severe treenut/peanut allergy. As I grew older, my allergies got worse (even until today). I can no longer have a handful of fruits (including bananas, cherries, kiwi, peaches) or raw vegetables (celery, carrots). I know that these fruit/vegetable allergies are OAS (oral allergy syndrome). I also cannot eat seafood (shellfish) and avoid soy in large quantities (if I eat too much I will start seeing the on-set of a reaction). I also have a mild allergy to milk and eggs (I can't have eggs on their own, only baked within foods).\n\nI am also allergic to penicillin and there are quite a few antibiotics that don\u2019t sit well with me and trigger my vasovagal. \n\nI have had trouble swallowing food since I was a child. My family would tell me it\u2019s in my head \u2013 and I would just continue thinking that it\u2019s my \u201cstress\u201d causing this. But how stressed can you be at 8-years-old?\n\nAnyways, back to EoE. I take  prevacid 30mg and flovent (both twice daily) to help with EoE symptoms (started this in November 2017). I am beginning to question how effective they actually are. Upon EoE discovery, my specialist noticed my weight to be on the lower end (according to BMI I am underweight for my height/age). I\u2019ve always been skinny though \u2013 just figured it had to do with metabolism or thyroid \\[at about 12 years old, I started taking synthroid for my hypothyroidism (you\u2019re supposed to gain weight with this condition, not lose it)\\]. They also did a biopsy to find out that it most likely is an allergen causing my esophagus to inflame, but what else could I possibly be allergic to?! Wheat?!\n\nI have had about 4-5 endoscopies in the last year (about 3-4 of them were to stretch my esophagus which was originally found to be only 3mm in diameter!) and after the last one in June 2018, I have had significant weight loss and stomach issues (pain, burning). I have done a CT Scan and a few ultrasounds, all which have come back normal. After dinner though, I usually regurgitate my food in portions (maybe contributing to my weight loss?) and I have been having this pain where my esophagus meets my stomach.\n\nI have my next \"stretch\" next week and I'm not nervous, just frustrated. Not only has this affected my social life, its beginning to affect me emotionally and noticeably physically too. \n\n**Can anyone relate?**\n\n\\*sigh\\*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 362, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can anyone relate?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/9f009w/can_anyone_relate/"}, {"author": "reignthepain", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1mbg0ta8", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1535916292, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/9cer92/all_of_them/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9cer92", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/9cer92/all_of_them/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1535916292, "score": 12, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 354, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "image", "title": "All of them", "url": "https://i.redd.it/45l6ghp6mvj11.jpg"}, {"author": "pascalsgirlfriend", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1534967008, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/99ggqg/job_loss/", "gilded": 0, "id": "99ggqg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/99ggqg/job_loss/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1534967010, "score": 3, "selftext": "Has anyone had to quit their job because of EoE?

About the time I noticed I was having weird trouble getting food all the way down, I was also noticing a strange issue with my breathing. My mother has very bad asthma that for years was not well controlled, so when I first started noticing this issue, she took me to the ER thinking I needed a breathing treatment after her rescue inhaler did nothing to help me. The ER doctor basically said it was due to stress and that, no, this was not an asthma attack. Years later, when I finally got an appointment for an endoscopy, the gastroenterologist I saw dismissed it as more than likely stress or, Tourette\u2019s Syndrome (more on that later). My allergy doctor I see for my EOE treatment has also chocked my breathing issue as stress... more than likely. I\u2019m FINE with it very possibly being due to stress, but I truly don\u2019t believe that it is. It seems to me to be completely random and during times of great stress, I don\u2019t notice happening any more or any less than when I\u2019m in times of low stress. \nSo after all that, I\u2019ll try to describe in some coherent manner, what I experience with this breathing issue. As I mentioned earlier, my mom has asthma, and I know asthma is an issue with being able to exhale effectively. My issue has always been with inhalation, so I know it\u2019s not asthma. My issue is that, at times that seem COMPLETELY random to me, when I inhale, I get the feeling that I cannot fulling inflate my lungs or being able to move my diaphragm as much as normal (what I describe as not be able to \u201creach the bottom\u201d of my lungs). Sometimes this issue with being able to not inhale properly will last a few minutes or it can last for *days*. Nothing too awful has ever happened from it apart from my chest actually hurting after a while of feeling like I\u2019m giving my inhale everything I have every time I take a breath and the feeling of slight lightheadedness after a time. But I\u2019ve never passed out or anything, thankfully. The Tourette\u2019s Syndrome theory was presented to me by my rather dismissive gastroenterologist bc I noticed when I shake my head and neck or bend over at the waist, that tends to help me breathe better- it doesn\u2019t cause the issue to stop- but it seems to help. I do this now completely absentmindedly my now and so I can certainly see why it could present itself as a tick. Before my endoscopy showed the eosinophils, I thought these twitching/head shaking things, might mean a hiatal hernia, and by shaking my head, I was doing something to put my stomach back down below my diaphragm, thereby giving my lungs more room to expand. Nope- this idea was dismissed, I was told it was very likely Tourette\u2019s, and sent on my way with nary another word about it- great fun. So, after all that drivel (those who made it to the end, bless you, you\u2019re a real trooper), has anyone else who\u2019s been diagnosed with EOE, experienced anything like this? \n\nTLDR: diagnosed with EOE 4 years ago, symptomatic for 15+ years, also have trouble being able to fully inflate lungs when inhaling to breathe, wondering if this could be related to my EOE and if anyone else has it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 324, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Weird Breathing Trouble", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/91oc8m/weird_breathing_trouble/"}, {"author": "reignthepain", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1532486661, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/91nzcm/chest_pain/", "gilded": 0, "id": "91nzcm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/91nzcm/chest_pain/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1532486662, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 6, "selftext": "Feelin like a rock is stuck in my chest ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 324, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Chest pain \ud83d\ude29", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/91nzcm/chest_pain/"}, {"author": "lunakatt", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1532410598, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/91eoec/hiccups/", "gilded": 0, "id": "91eoec", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/91eoec/hiccups/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1532410599, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 3, "selftext": "Does any one else get a bout of hiccups while eating right before an attack?

Not that they instinctually know what foods to avoid, but they're just hard to please. In particular, they may not care about flavors, but they may find certain textures revolting. Psychologists may suggest a sort of exposure therapy to get them to eat, but personally I wouldn't try it. I remember what those food intolerances felt like, even if it was psychological, and my parents' efforts to make me eat left me with a really bad relationship with food in general.\n\n\nAfter a dozen endoscopies you can develop a tolerance for the \"twilight\" anaesthetic (Versed) and need to switch to something stronger like propofol. The last time they tried to put me under with Versed they had to use several times the normal dose. This isn't to put anyone off of getting scoped, just something to be aware of. Twilight sedation sucks anyway, I'm always left feeling very out of it the rest of the day. Propofol doesn't do that nearly as bad.\n\n\nIf you happen to have also inherited a connective tissue disorder like Ehlers-Danloss, the two diseases can make each other much, much worse.\n\n\nAn ER endoscopy for a food impaction has about a 1 in 1000 chance of puncturing the esophagus and putting you in intensive care for a while. (My first gastroenterologist told me that.)\n\n\nAs many have noted, a drink of soda can often clear an impaction. A friend of mine with a different kind of congenital dysphagia told me about that trick. Be careful though. If the liquids won't flow past the food bolus and the bolus won't move, you could wind up drowning on your beverage. So make sure someone is with you and knows what you're up against before you try it.\n\n\nAlright, that's enough of that.

I'm not a doctor, but I and my child both suffer from EoE, and are both being treated by some of the world's foremost experts on this disease. We've been through allergy testing, elimination diet, and medication. Over two dozen endoscopies between us (and still counting). So, if I may, a few points that may save someone else some pain:\n\n\nFirst of all, this is a lifelong condition. If you manage to get it into remission, that's great but it **will** start to return if you stop treating it.\n\n\nSecond, it's genetic. If you have children, watch them for signs of dysphagia. Kids are kinda stupid sometimes, and won't always realize that food getting stuck isn't normal.\n\n\nYou should probably be going in for a sort of regular maintenance scope every few years. Your treatment may be working well, but nothing is 100%. It's good to get it checked out, and your gastroenterologist can break any strictures that have formed since the last time.\n\n\nIf you're taking flovent, you're supposed to puff it into your mouth, hold it there, then swallow hard. And then don't eat or drink for the next half hour. The point is for the medicine to sit in your throat and deactivate your eosinophils.\n\n\nSame thing with budesonide, but you need to mix the liquid with something to make a slurry. In my experience nothing works better for this than four packets of Splenda. Swallow, let it coat your throat, and don't disturb it for a half hour.\n\n\nPay attention to any other autoimmune and dysautonomia symptoms you may have. EoE often comes in a cluster with other conditions like POTS, Raynaud's phenomenon, Chrone's, etc..\n\n\nUntreated, this disease can eventually kill you. The strictures can build up so badly that nothing can make it down. Then you die of thirst or starvation. In the year 2018 of course most of us would be taken to a hospital long before it got that bad. But in the past people died of this. So take your treatment seriously.\n\n\nI hope this helps someone in heading off trouble and avoiding relapses and staying out of the ER.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 295, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Understanding EoE", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/8u3il3/understanding_eoe/"}, {"author": "CasinsWatkey", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1529767335, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/8tamcs/we_just_discovered_my_sister_has_eoe/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8tamcs", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/8tamcs/we_just_discovered_my_sister_has_eoe/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1529767336, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 5, "selftext": "It's difficult trying to find food she can eat, I feel like she needs to see a doctor who will look at her esophagus damage and recommend something so that she doesn't end up with irreversible damage.\n\nWe're in central Kentucky, is there a case study she can participate in that anyone knows about?

I was eating chicken and rice and my throat just didn\u2019t let me swallow. I got super anxious. Before this episode, I had a lot of weird issues like growing sensitivities, serious bloating, acid reflux, exhaustion, anxiety, dizziness, etc.\n\nAfter about a month of having trouble swallowing, the occasional choking episode, and anxiety/panic attacks like you read about - I finally went to the doctor. \n\nI had EoE, GERD, and a small sliding hiatal hernia. My EoE was present in my whole esophagus and I had some rings. I started taking omeprazole, ranitidine, and swallowd inhaler and felt considerably worse. I tried some elimination diets on my own to no avail. My anxiety, swallowing, globus, and now sore throat were horrible. So I went to a renowned doctor in Boston who put me on 40mg PPI twice a day. No dietary restrictions (I\u2019m allergic to shellfish).\n\nMy EoE was down to 0 or 1 in all parts. So I\u2019m PPI responsive. But I truly felt terrible on the PPI\u2019s and still had trouble swallowing from time to time. I was shocked when I was \u201ccured.\u201d So the next step was my doctor had me eliminate gluten and dairy - and after 6 weeks my eosinophils were down, but my EoE was active again.\n\nI\u2019m trying to manage my EoE by diet today, off PPI but on supplements and avoiding foods including dairy gluten and soy. I\u2019ve realized my stomach acid must be incredibly low as I am up to 13 Betaine HCL with pepsin tablets (they raise stomach acid) with no burn (the signal you\u2019ve reached your dose). My digestion has improved considerably and now my issues are some trouble swallowing, hoarse throat, constant little burps that feel like they\u2019re effecting the throat. I have more energy than I had before and I have zero anxiety attacks like I do when I take the occasional PPI.\n\nI was convinced that my EoE was all caused in my gut and if I fix that I will fix everything. But, I am still nervous that I am leaving my EoE untreated and it may be causing all of these symptoms. \n\nI\u2019m seeing a naturopathic doctor but am considering going back to the PPI 40mg twice a day.

Here's my story:\n\nDec 2018- diagnosed with EOE with 70 eos per hpf and ridges, edema, white plaques on endoscopy, no strictures.Started a PPI\n\nFeb 2019- no improvement in symptoms or endoscopy results with PPI. Skin allergy testing did not detect any food allergens. Started six food elimination diet (no seafood, nuts, eggs, soy, milk, wheat)\n\nFeb 2020- just finished six food elimination (i.e. 7 endoscopies in 1 year). One of the more difficult things I've done in my life, but so glad I did. I had a lot anxiety around eating which caused flares and I was very bad at identifying my own triggers (research shows most people with EOE are like me). I'm also very fortunate to work for govt and have good medical insurance, which I understand many people don't have or live in countries with nationalized healthcare that do not pay for repeat endoscopies. The diet identified nuts and eggs as my trigger. My symptoms are under control, endoscopies normal, and biopsies 0 eos per hpf!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTips for Six food elimination diet:\n\n\\-Cook everything at home. Buy a rice cooker and wok for veggies. Buy a good blender for smoothies. Prepare yourself to eat a lot of meat (if you're not vegetarian) and the same food regularly. If you work, bring your lunch from home every day. If you cook for yourself make a big batch of food Sunday night and Wed or Thursday night and eat throughout the week. \n\n\\-Cancel all non-essential travel during your diet (\\~10 mos -1 year). It is very hard to follow diet when traveling. \n\n\\-Bring bag a snacks with you wherever you go so you don't get suck somewhere hungry without options\n\n\\-If you have a whole foods, trader joes, or local co-op near you try to buy your food there\n\n\\-Eliminate caffeine, alcohol, and chocolate during the diet if you have reflux or they cause you symptoms. They are not forbidden during diet, but they can increase reflux/inflammation and avoiding them can help your esophagus heal\n\n\\-Check all ingredient lists at grocery store and ask restaurant workers to show you ingredients or check online. Most people have no idea what's in their food (I never did) and unfortunately, instead of saying I don't know will just guess, often incorrectly. \n\n\\-Eating out (restaurants): when unavoidable stick to chains who are mandate to report their allergen info online. Salads, steak, burgers with lettuce wrap, baked potatoes, rice are often best bets\n\n\\-Eating out (fast food)- In-N-Out hamburger, protein style/lettuce warp, ketchup and mustard instead of spread, grilled onions, fries.

Food and water piled up on top, and I had to regurgitate to relieve the pressure. This surprised me, because I've been on PPIs for awhile, and in general I have had very few regurgitation events in the last number of months. This regurgitation felt like hundreds I had done in the past. It felt mostly cleared out, but not completely. I swallowed a half teaspoon of mayonnaise to help clear out the remaining obstructions. That was followed by incredible pain in my chest. I had ruptured my esophagus.\n\nMy wife called an ambulance and I went to the nearest hospital. The triage nurse said I would be seen asap. The coordinator however had a different plan... and set my priority to high. I sat in the waiting room for over 2 hours, until a nurse or doctor came out to fetch me personally as they understood the urgency of the situation. \n\nAfter an hour or so, it felt like the adrenaline had worn off. Out of 10, I would give the pain a 27. At this level, things start to blur. Your lizard brain kicks in, and you can't really control yourself. It's hard to remember things or even speak. I could understand what was being said around me, but trying to formulate sentences seemed impossible. Luckily my brother had arrived to do the talking for me - he has EoE as well. I don't know what I would have done without him. \n\nI was moved into the ER with rows and rows of beds. Seems they were quite busy that night. Fuck. Although I was being given pain meds, they didn't feel like they did anything. Lowering a 27 to a 21, just has no real impact. I also had to constantly fight for those meds. They wouldn't give me anything unless I asked. But when I asked, they wouldn't give me more. Also, when they *did* finally agree to get me pain meds, they would take 30-45+ mins plus to actually come back with them.\n\nThere were other problems too... but I think I've complained enough about the ER for this post. At the end of the day, I was at a ~27/10 pain level for 14 hours before I entered the OR. It was traumatizing. Even thinking about it now makes me shiver.\n\nAfter I awoke from OR, breathing was very difficult. They had performed a left thoracotomy to get to the esophagus to fix a 2-3 cm tear (the biggest they see). From what I understand, this collapsed my left lung for a time. My right lung had a large pleural effusion from their efforts to clean out all the food from my insides. Because of the pain from the night before, my muscles tried to stay as tense as possible for 14 hours to protect my chest. My chest muscles also felt non functional.\n\nThe first time I tried to walk, I took about 8 steps, and was asked to stop as my BPM was 130. It was because my breathing was so poor. They put in a pigtail (chest tube) to drain fluid using TPA. A nurse later told me that their protocol is to inform a doctor if they drain more than 400 CCs of fluid. The first draining, they drained around 1500 CCs (3 pints).\n\nI went through 10 rounds of TPA treatment over the course of my stay. Basically, they push a chemical into your chest tube, hold it there, then drain with suction over the course of 2 hours. Then repeat for another 2 hours with a different chemical. One at 9am and one at 9pm. It's incredibly painful. I'm not sure the total, but I think they drained over 4 litres of fluid.\n\nAfter a week, I could start walking again without my heart rate spiking. I also started to become more lucid. I realized just what had happened and I was quite upset. I felt emotionally broken... I have a wife at home with my 6 month year old baby, and I was stuck in the hospital. That was the hardest part about this whole thing - being away from them and knowing that my wife was handling the baby solo.\n\nThe food was tough to eat. All processed paste that made me want to gag at times. The soups weren't so bad. Overall, I found the food demoralizing. It was just another reminder of not being at home with my family. It had to be done though - needed to only eat essentially fluids to allow my esophagus to repair itself.\n\nI was discharged after 17 days. The care I received after the OR was overall phenomenal (minus a few hiccups). I lost 15 pounds and my stamina is shot. Currently, it feels like I have the worst flu of my life. I get a little better every day. I think it's going to take months to feel normal again.\n\nWhy did I share all this? I wanted to write it out to help put it behind me. I also wanted to write it up as a warning to others - stay on top of your health. I was delaying seeing a specialist because the PPIs I was on seemed to be working well enough. I lost 2.5 weeks with my family, and put my life at risk.

First-\n\nMy Symptoms:\n\n* Uncomfortable Swallowing\n* Tightness in the throat - Neck/Throat area feels heavy, sometimes feel as though there's a band around it.\n* Hoarseness - My voice feels fatigued after talking\n* Lump in Throat Sensation\n* Chest Sensations (Hurts when I sneeze)\n* Hypersalivation\n* Sometimes Jaw Pain \\*Sometimes feel out of breath - trouble getting a full breath in\n\nAll of this has been going on for about a month now. Here's what went down. I have been previously diagnosed with Eosoniphillic Esophagitis (EOE) which caused a lot of food impactions. Due to this, I was encouraged to get an **Esophageal Dilation** to ultimately stretch it so that I could swallow food easily. The surgery went all as planned, and I was told that I could go back to eat whatever I wanted afterward. Everything seemed ok besides a little soreness of the throat but not too much for it to be uncomfortable.\n\n**3 Days later** and it all came down on me on Christmas day. Tightness in Throat and trouble swallowing were my main symptoms and I was terrified it was so uncomfortable I had to get rushed to the ER to get all of the tests (CT scan &amp; Barium) but they all came back clean.\n\nWeeks later after no improvement, I went and saw an ENT for my symptoms and he had a laryngoscopy (scope through the nose to the throat) and he reported that he saw a lot of irritation, redness, and swelling. He indicated that I had LaryngoPharyngeal Reflux (LPR) **and that acid reflux was more free-flowing due to the dilation**. I was on a PPI &amp; H2 Blocker.\n\nAfter about a month with small improvements, I then went and saw an EOE Gastro specialist get another opinion. She ultimately told me that an EOE patient undergoing a procedure like that should have been dealt with very delicately as their esophagus is very \"fragile\". She thinks that the Dilation done caused some sort of an esophageal mucosal injury and it's just going to take a lot of time to heal. I am currently taking PPI twice a day.\n\nAt this point, I'm doing everything that I can to avoid all acidic foods &amp; drinks to keep my reflux under control because this is just absolutely miserable. I've put a wedge on my pillow at night, avoid late-night eating, not laying down until 3 hours after eating. Just seems like these symptoms are just not getting resolved fast enough.\n\nAny Thoughts?

Just for kicks I weaned myself off of coffee and have been off for a month now, though I do sneak in a Diet Coke here and there.  I have had no swallowing issues for most of the past 3 weeks or so.\n\nI do miss coffee but I like being able to swallow normally again.

He was diagnosed at around age 3 and we learned of the exact trigger around age 4.  We knew what it was around age 2 but had to let the doctors do their scientific method and elimination diets.  I thought I could be a resource for others who are either going through it or are parents of kids who have symptoms and are figuring out diagnosis and triggers.\n\nAround 12-18 mos he started vomiting up milk in quantities and gagging a lot.  He could keep down a few ounces, but if he drank a full bottle it would come back up.  We live in NYC and are fortunate to have access to some great doctors. We took him to a Gastroenterologist, did the quick diagnosis of reflux that is so quickly given to kids.  He had a barium swallow, they did the whole work up on him and just ran him through the system.  The meds they gave us for that diagnosis weren't working, so it was then that my wife began to do some deeper digging.  We ended up at the Food Allergy Center at Weill Cornell and after waiting 6 months for an appointment with THE person over there, he got his first endoscopy.  His esophagus was all riddled with eosinophils and had the potential for future scarring.  They put us on the elimination diet: no soy, egg, dairy.  By now, he was approaching 3 years old.  Poor kid, it was painful, but we slogged through it.  Why no wheat? I'm not sure, but they were able to test for it and it came up negative (that fact is blurry), but I definitely remember no wheat.  After 3 months of no triggers, he had an endoscopy ... add back in a trigger, get another scope, etc. Couldn't add back a potential trigger until the scopes were clean.  This took about a year.\n\nWhat finally came out was that between 3-4 years old, he was officially diagnosed with EoE and his trigger was dairy.  Now, we knew that, going way back to when he was a toddler, but at least the science confirmed that and we knew we weren't crazy. The doctor, who is one of (if not \"the\" leading minds on EoE) said we could try a new-ish treatment.  She prescribed Flovent for him. It's the same steroid inhaler given to asthma sufferers, but instead of inhaling it, it would be swallowed.  It was explained that EoE is like asthma of the esophagus and the treatment for it may be the same.\n\nAll this while, he's getting an annual scope which he's used to by now.  He's had clean endoscopies for the last 5 years but he's been under STRICT supervision from us.  What he has been able to do is processed baked dairy.  Dairy that's been baked for enough time at a certain temperature changes and is no longer a trigger.  SO ... while he can't eat ice cream, butter, yogurt, cheese, he can eat pizza and goldfish and homemade baked goods with controlled portions of milk/butter.\n\nNaturally we're concerned about what will happen to him as he ages and gets self-sufficient ... and then careless about his system. But we got him this far, he's been a trooper.  That's our/his story, I thought I'd share it with the community.\n\nnow, back to /r/mildlyinfuriating", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1076, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Parent of child with EoE", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/erzvpu/parent_of_child_with_eoe/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "aidan1478", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1axrtnj5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1579497628, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/er8m3l/constant_flare_ups_what_else_can_i_try_to_control/", "gildings": {}, "id": "er8m3l", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/er8m3l/constant_flare_ups_what_else_can_i_try_to_control/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1579497634, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello!\nI\u2019m getting really frustrated. It took years for me to finally figure out what was wrong. Receiving the diagnosis of EoE wasn\u2019t great but at least it was something I could now manage! \n\nOr so I thought. \n\nIt\u2019s been a just over year now, I\u2019ve had a couple of scopes. Initially we did swallowed fluticasone, which worked in addition to diet modification. I kept the diet modifications and stopped taking fluticasone. I\u2019ve been on dexilant (PPI) for about a year and a half now in addition to singulaire (eosinophilic related allergies and asthma). I feel like neither of these are working anymore. I\u2019ve started to get increasingly worse heartburn, and every time I do bloodwork my eosinophils are at a steady 1.1 - 1.4. It\u2019s fucking frustrating as all hell cause I\u2019ll be fine for 4-5 weeks and then all of a sudden that dreaded feeling of food getting stuck in my chest/not going down starts. \n\nI\u2019ve most recently tried budenoside, which also worked. But again, like clockwork, 4-5 weeks later it returned. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if there are any other solutions? I\u2019d like to avoid dilation (I\u2019m terrified of scopes). My diet is absolute garbage right now as well cause there isn\u2019t a lot I can get down (I also have gastroparesis so I need to find foods I can get down AND keep down, which presents further problems). \n\nDo I try to do a liquid boost diet to give everything a rest in addition to the fluticasone? And has anyone had any luck with singulaire lowering eosinophils in bloodwork and helping with symptoms? I\u2019d like to get off of the medications I\u2019m on if they\u2019re not doing anything. \n\nAlso if there are any other solutions others gave tried that would be greatly appreciated! My doc is amazing and has helped me work through several diets and medications, I\u2019m just frustrated and scared of him wanting to do a dilation.

Recently I was grabbing breakfast with my girlfriend and had to rush to the bathroom and force it out. That was bad enough, but just a week later I choked again at her parent's house and her dad rushed over to hiemlich me. Not exactly sure if that helped but it was certaintly embarassing as I created a huge mess in front of my SO and her parents. It was also incredibly scary. But really, really embarassing. \n\nAt first I thought I was really just eating too fast but I've been much more careful and the incidents have been getting more frequent and intense (3 times in the past month). \n\nI'm 22 but I heard that sometimes EOE can be developed in adulthood? I know my brother had it when he was a kid. Anyway, I'm still in college so I'm going to ask my parents to take me to the doctor and get this figured out asap. I'm really scared to eat and much more terrified about eating in front of others now. \n\nMy gf sent me links about this disease after this embarassing story took place and I found this subreddit after. Like I said I don't have any diagnosis but it sounds like my situation so far and I really want to prevent these embarassing events again or I'll probably just become a recluse. \n\nAnyway thanks for reading this through if you did, I know it's super rambly.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1071, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Embarassing rant/story", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/eqspmk/embarassing_rantstory/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Unknown010900", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5gzgyimr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1579337556, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/eqe3w5/please_help_feeling_of_food_stuck_in_chest/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eqe3w5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/eqe3w5/please_help_feeling_of_food_stuck_in_chest/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1579337557, "score": 1, "selftext": "greetings! the past few days I have been worried about having cancer, but this is most likely affected by my health ocd.

I just spotted this as a rising community on the sidebar and was excited and surprised to see this community exists!\n\nWhen I was in my early teens, I suddenly out of the blue began experiencing strong reactions to certain foods, essentially any raw plant protein. The very first reaction I ever had was with a Wendy's Frosty which I'd had many times throughout my childhood. I was in the car with my family after a drive-thru stop, started eating my Frosty when suddenly I started to experience a lot of pain and swelling in my throat. My mouth began filling with saliva I could not swallow and my parents had to pull over so I could spit it out. Over the next few months, I found myself unable to eat most raw fruits and vegetables anymore without this reaction occurring.\n\nDuring a family vacation in Maine a couple of years later, I was eating KFC and swallowed a piece of chicken somewhat hastily. It did not go down. I was sent to the hospital where they put me on muscle relaxants that didn't work (though it was an entertaining experience). Finally they performed an endoscopy, but due to my very low weight (I was in the first percentile for being underweight as a child), they did not succeed in knocking me out entirely. I struggled as they crammed the scope down my throat and it was only after I began feebly kicking that they realized I was cognizant, and delivered more sedative. By then it was more or less over anyhow.\n\nThey expressed surprise at how small the piece of chicken retrieved from my esophagus was. Upon returning home, I was told I had GERD and prescribed omaprezole. It did nothing to alleviate my symptoms though the doctors didn't seem to believe me. For the most part I just coped by avoiding my trigger foods. I was given a barium test to check for a narrowing of my esophagus, during which a barium pill got stuck as the radiologist was watching the x-ray feed. \"I didn't ask for a still frame!\" snapped the radiologist to her radiology technician, who replied \"Uh, that's live.\" The radiologist stared at the pill stuck in my esophagus, said \"...that's never happened before...\" and ran off to find a gastroenterologist. It passed after half an hour so with a small amount of yogurt to help it down.\n\nSeveral years later I got a piece of steak stuck, and back to the hospital I went. This time they managed to knock me out properly (they seemed horrified when I recounted my earlier experience) and scoping me out a gastroenterologist informed me that I might have a relatively new condition that was being studied. A short while later I was given an inhaler to breathe in and swallow, as well as budesonide.  I didn't see any real improvement with these, and being on my own insurance while working a minimum-wage job, I couldn't afford the cost (and budesonide tastes *nasty*), so I stopped taking them and continued to avoid my trigger foods.\n\nAnother food impaction happened in my mid-20s. This time, they took a biopsy while they were in there. I live in a city with a rather prominent medical college. After the biopsy, I was informed that I had over 50x more eosinophils per count than the worst case the hospital and associated college had witnessed to date. I was told I had a \"feline\" or \"crepe-paper\" esophagus with a papery inner-lining that sloughed off very easily and was a big part of why food gets stuck so easily for me. Years of irritation and swelling has had its toll on me. They wanted to experiment with a number of options which I declined due to cost and the relative uncertainty of the proposed treatments.\n\nBy this point, I was experiencing a few food impactions a month, though they would generally pass after a few hours of dry-heaving. Doing my own research, I found that Flonase (Fluticasone) being swallowed seemed to help when I accidentally ate a trigger food. Speaking with a gastroenterologist not long after that after I had another food-impaction hospital trip, they recommended that I swallow Flonase, at which point I admitted I'd been doing that as a result of my own research for some time.\n\nAnyhow, that's my journey. I've had some pretty bad impactions recently, but what I've found over the years is that if something gets stuck, either I have to eat something soft like yogurt or jello within a minute or so to push down the item that got stuck, or I have to try to relax, spit in a cup for a few hours until the swelling reduces a bit, and then try eating something soft again, and usually it goes down. It's uncomfortable and unpleasant, but it's how I've dealt with it for years.\n\nI'm curious if any of you are receiving a treatment which isn't overly expensive (while I make a decent wage, my insurance still sucks) and has produced good results. I haven't intentionally eaten any raw fruits or vegetables in decades (cooked are perfectly fine) and some things like ice cream (I strongly suspect the collagen in thickeners) I can only eat fairly small helpings of. I would love to taste a watermelon or a banana again some day!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1064, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "EE and me", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ep771f/ee_and_me/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "janet_snakehole01", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2e3x6i2m", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1579109690, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ep5do6/alcohol_and_coffee/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ep5do6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ep5do6/alcohol_and_coffee/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1579109693, "score": 1, "selftext": "Do you guys find that you can\u2019t have alcohol or coffee anymore?

After a while, I went to my doctor to see what was wrong, and she suspected it was gastritis, so she prescribed me Omeprazole to see if it would help. After I ingested ONE pill, I starting feeling a tightness in my throat about 30 minutes later. It never went away, in fact it just got worse and worse. It came to the point where I could barely eat anything because my throat felt so tight. I decided to wait it out, and it eventually did subside and go away.\n\nHowever, I felt this tingling feeling in my uvula that wouldn't go away for whatever reason. A week later, and I start feeling this tight feeling in my throat again. This time though, it didn't go away. It didn't progressively get worse though, as it eventually stopped at a certain point, but it was there and it was a nuisance because I was struggling to eat. \n\nEventually, I saw a gastroenterologist and she decided to schedule an EGD to see what was up. I went through the procedure and everything went great. A few days later, I receive a call saying I have Eosonophilic Esophogitis. I had no clue what it was at the time, so being the curious person that I am, I decided to do more research on it.\n\nI've never had any allergies as far as I'm aware of and have been able to eat any food without any negative reactions. I know EoE isn't like your typical allergic disease, and that it is hard to narrow down what you're actually allergic to, but from my experience, I really feel like the Omperazole is what possibly caused or triggered it. I know it sounds weird, but maybe someone can explain to me why I am wrong.\n\nJust for further note, I am currently taking Budenoside and have been for 2 days now and I am experiencing slight improvements which is good. I haven't tried any elimination diets, but I might have to in the future because I was informed that the Budenoside is mainly temporary. \n\nAlso, I don't know how important this information is, but I have always had issues swallowing before. But those were mainly caused by me not chewing the food enough, which would eventually make the food feel stuck in my throat.

I got diagnosed in August after having lost 25lbs in 2 months (115 to 89) and couldn\u2019t keep down water. After a year of worsening symptoms shit hit the fan and I passed out on the train into work. \n\nIt\u2019s been a rough journey and I\u2019m finally seeing results with Flovent/PPIs, however, I have intractable nausea around food. So much so, they\u2019ve resorted to stimulating my appetite with  antidepressants (mirtazipam) and now an antipsychotic (Opanziprine). I just reduced the former and I\u2019m holding off on the latter due to having been the lucky 1% that reacts to the antidepressant with mania.  Any calories I\u2019ve been taking in have been burned by my activity (30k steps/ day with weight training and yoga for my restless soul.)\n\nWith that said, I\u2019m an athlete (I race motorcycles) and I can\u2019t gain the weight I need to begin training for next season. I\u2019m stuck around 100lbs and have completely changed my body comp (I went from strong to skinny fat to now very very fit with minimal fat). \n\nI\u2019m in a bind here and would love any recommendations - my GI doesn\u2019t want to start elimination until I\u2019m at least back to 110+. \n\nCurrent strategy since just thinking about food can kick of my nausea:\n\n1. Stay on eating schedule ( so hard when your brain goes, pass.\u201d)\n2. Densely caloric foods (nut butters, protein shakes, etc)\n3. Mostly liquid diet tends to digest easier (so much burping!)\n\nBiggest concern: I go back to the GI doc in Jan and they want a full elimination with a strictly liquid diet (FFS, not a tube, please).  I am working with a therapist to see if I can work through my food triggers (I\u2019ve never had a therapist and have never taken meds like this) and any recommendations are welcome.\n\nAnyone successfully work with a nutritionist or dietitian?

Should I go to a specialist for diet stuff or should I call my doctor and ask for them to refer me? Also does anyone know if there is any kind of pattern to what things people with Eos typically have, or is it a thing that differs wildly person to person? I'm asking because I didn't get a call back from my doctor for a follow up, only some papers and a prescription for flovent.  \n\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with Eos I was really surprised, through my childhood I was always told by my parents, peers , and authority figures that I was just acting sick (Throwing up, chest pain, being underweight , having trouble swallowing, not eating large food portions, and malnutrition) to get out of work ie. to be lazy. It really laid the groundwork to a lot of my anxiety , self doubt , and seeing myself as a weak dishonest person.  \n\n\nFinally it got to the point where I was calling in sick to work more an more frequently because of the condition causing bloating,  stomach ulcers, trouble swallowing and sleep deprivation. Then I would work myself extra hard at my job to try and make up for the missed days not wanting to be seen as a bad worker only to end up depleting all of my energy and burning out causing me to quit or lose my job. This would happen again and again in a viscous cycle worsening the anxiety and in turn worsening the condition, annihilating my finances time and time again keeping me trapped putting my life on hold desperately trying to find out what was wrong with me physically, or if it was something completely mental and I was somehow tricking myself that I was ill. It would even get to the point where I would basically eat yogurt for months on end losing 20 pounds or more during these times that the condition was flaring up to its worst.  \n\n\nThen I finally got on medical assistance and immediately went to the ER and now here I am. I am doing much better now the medication is working fairly well and it feels good to have some answers even if I don't know my food triggers yet.  \n\n\nI was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences, I'm kind of thrown off by how little information there is about this condition out there and it would do me a lot of favors to understand how it has affected others.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1025, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just got diagnosed with Eos", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ee7dkf/just_got_diagnosed_with_eos/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "that_bearshark", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3wmxwe5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576803369, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ed2je8/my_family_thinks_they_know_my_disorder_better/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ed2je8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ed2je8/my_family_thinks_they_know_my_disorder_better/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576803370, "score": 1, "selftext": "so 13 allergies including dairy wheat and eggs so holiday treats are rough.

He is generally atopic with mild body eczema and seasonal allergies and with diagnoses tree nut allergy. No asthma. He has always been a picky and poor eater and will not eat fruit other than apple sauce or beechnut fruit packs. However he drinks milk, eats dairy, eats broccoli, green beans, peas, meats, hummus, crackers, candy, peanut butter all with no GI issues. The one food he was intolerant with was peas when he was younger. He had a hard time swallowing and we did a fluoroscopic swallow study with him eating peas and there was no noticeable issues.\n\nSo while he eats, he is 1% on the weight charts and there were concerns, but he has always been low on the weight growth charts. CF test negative, blood work normal with slightly elevated monocytes and eosinophils. Did another SPT allergy test with an EoE panel and 7 foods  [https://imgur.com/BFoAMgX](https://imgur.com/BFoAMgX). Also bloodwork. Showed elevated legumes on SPT and bloodwork showed sesame seed.\n\nSo with all this, my son never once complained about issues swallowing or pain in his stomach or chest. He occasionally has stinky gas and constipation when younger, but we attributed this mostly to the whole milk dairy and not wanting to poop. He's only vomited on a handful of occasions when eating and that was when we pushed unpreferred foods like bananas and carrots. And the vomit came immediately from gagging. \n\nGI doctor put him on prilosec and wants to remove legumes from diet for 3 months and repeat EGD. Hopefully this will help him and also reduce the eos count and get him to eat larger volume of foods to gain more weight. \n\nMost of what I'm reading here are adults talking about their EoE. We know someone on a g-tube elemental diet since 1yo because of complete rejection of food. At least my son can eat and swallow. So what I am really curious about is the severity of this disease.

She said the Dr will dilate my throat during the Endoscopy, and that combined with the heartburn meds will make it much easier to swallow.\n\nTo.give you an idea how bad the issue is, it's been almost 2 months since I last ate something \"solid\". Puddings, yogurts, and Ensures are all I've been able to eat. I've lost about 19 pounds since it got really bad. The GI said the Endoscopy would help greatly afterwards.\n\nHas anyone who had an Endoscopy with Dilation had a much easier time swallowing? Does it really help? I'm sorry for the long post.

It was the bane of my existence.  I saw dozens of gastros to try and figure out what was wrong with me.  One of them did an endoscopy and diagnosed my with EE.  I disregarded the diagnosis, as I didn't really have any issues with my esophagus, I had issues with my stomach and IBS.  \n\nSo, fast forward to about 5 years ago, I'd spent years trialing supplements, probiotics, natural remedies, etc. and finally figured out my IBS.  I essentially \"cured\" myself of it with my lifestyle, food choices and supplements.  But, curious thing started happening since I \"cured\" my IBS.  I started getting what I thought to be acid reflux.  Truth be told, it was always kind of there, but less of a quality of life issue compared to my IBS stuff, so I put it on the back burner.  Since then,  I've had a TIF surgery about 2 years ago, which is a partial fundoplication to fix the acid reflux, but I still have issues with regurgitation, esophageal spasms, and anxiety provoking problems where my throat chooses to just start closing and narrowing for no reason, causing all types of issues.\n\nAbout a month ago, after failed attempts to figure out what was wrong, I had a family member tell me to revisit that diagnosis over 10 years ago of EE, which I had totally forgotten about.  Now, I'm pretty sure after reading and doing some research, it is the genesis of many of my problems and issues.  So, a few questions:\n\nIs it possible I cured my IBS or eosinophils in my stomach (IBS) and now they've managed to move their way up to my esophagus causing issues there as well?\n\nDoes EE ever really go away or can it just lay somewhat dormant?  Like problems can come and go, sometime more extreme?  My problems go in and out, but they have gotten worse as I've gotten older.  I'm a 37 male, and they have definitely been getting worse and more noticeable as of late.  \n\nWhere the heck do I start?  The doctor I received the original EE diagnosis from, actually doesn't practice anymore.  Do I just find an allergist, etc. and just tell them that I have EE and I need a treatment plan?   I have no idea where to go from here, but as I read more about EE, it seems like it's exactly what I've been suffering from.  \n\nThanks everyone for reading.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2915, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Searching for IBS cure, doctor found EE, now what do I do?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/r7la6p/searching_for_ibs_cure_doctor_found_ee_now_what/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "pythons_bunny", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8olmocj", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1638466484, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/r7cmtc/need_help_changing_how_i_eat_feeling_overwhelmed/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r7cmtc", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/r7cmtc/need_help_changing_how_i_eat_feeling_overwhelmed/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1638466495, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was recently diagnosed with EoE.

I am 29m and was diagnosed with EOE 2 years ago but have most likely had it since I was in my early teens as I have had issues with Dysphagia since then. My mother has GERD with very similar symptoms so we just assumed I was the same and took OTC 20mg Lansoprazole and this seemed to very much reduce my symptoms to where I was only getting food stuck every month or 2, but still requiring me to drink a lot of liquid when I ate. In 2015 I started to have severe chest pain and went to the Cardiologist for it, described my pain and they immediately told me it wasn't heart related but ran all the tests anyway to be safe. After some time (I don't recall but probably a month or 2) the pain went away and I didn't think anything of it. I was overweight and they found issues with my heart (unrelated to the pain) so I decided to lose weight and lose 40lbs over the next 5-6 months to being under 200lbs where I plateau due to life and work and not focusing on it as much as this change helped a lot. Nothing different for me over the next few years when I have another huge chest pain outbreak in 2019. This time I have a GP and tell her about my past experiences with this and after confirming with cardiologist this wasn't heart issue she referred me to a GI where he does an endoscopy and biopsy and tells me I have EOE. He prescribed me 40mg omezaprole twice a day and again my symptoms went away after a month or 2 and thought all was good. He didn't really get into the causes or anything, just gave medication to see if it fixes it. I had another endoscopy in 2020 and my numbers were much better and he stretched my throat and at this point I no longer need to drown all my food with water and can eat a whole meal without needing any liquids (which for the most case is still this way today). But it was always a battle with insurance to get the omezaprole twice a day refilled so we switched to once a day and seemed okay until about 2 months ago. I had another huge chest pain breakout and my GI changed me to Pantoprazole 40mg twice a day to see if that would help. It doesn't seem to be making any difference though as it seems to get better and then get worse. I have not tried the steroid route but have an appointment with my GI next week and was going to ask if I'm still having issues to see about trying it.\n\nAfter finally reading more into it over the past month or so I decided to go full cold turkey and start the elimination diet 2 weeks ago. I cut out dairy, wheat, soy, fish, nuts, eggs, legumes, and corn. Things with the holidays were a little rough, I was reading over everyone and checking what everyone was using but wanted to be safe. Things seem to be progressing in a downward trend which is a good sign but seems like the next day is worse than the previous then better the next day so not sure if I'm eating a trigger I didn't cut out or if it's just the joys of being inflamed from whatever I ate several weeks ago. I now keep a log of everything I eat, down to the spices I use, and I record how I felt throughout the day to track that I truly am making progress.\n\nSo my question to anyone that has been through it is did you find any weird food triggers that I may want to consider keeping an eye on?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2907, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "EOE Triggers", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/r59k2z/eoe_triggers/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Vegetable-Trouble978", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bh4kl00m", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1638206065, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/r50jh2/new_to_this/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r50jh2", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/r50jh2/new_to_this/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1638206076, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi.

My symptoms didn't completely resolve but I felt better than I had in years. For context I take a PPI and even famotidine PRN on top of that for when my pain escalates. On a bad week I would take two famotidines a day, on a good week maybe just three or so for the whole week. On elimination I went 4 weeks without needing famotidine! A real tangible result for the first time after years of confusion!\n\nWorking with my dietitian we decided it was time to reintroduce foods. She said to start with what I thought would be the least likely to react to. So I picked seafood, it's just not a major part of my diet so I didn't see it as a major trigger. I've also seen some people on here say it probably not even worth doing on the elimination diet.\n\nSo I ate tune three times in one day and fished the can. That night I had diarrhea that woke me up a couple times in the night. Didn't think much of it, reintroducing foods is probably a little tough on digestion right? I feel fine for 2 days but sure enough on day 3 my pain is back, and now a week later it's still going strong. I've needed famotidine every day to keep my pain manageable.\n\nI start looking through my food journals and it's all starting to click, I feel like the main character at the end of the sixth sense. That time I tried the mediterranean diet and my symtoms got way worse?  I was eating way more sea food. That time I got really sick on my birthday after eating sushi, yeah there it is. \n\nThat being said, I think I'm still looking for another source. I've gone long periods of time without seafood and I have symtoms every day. Still pretty crazy!

Mainly my problem is just food getting stuck in my throat, where I can\u2019t swallow my spit, or eat/drink anything until it goes down by itself (it takes 2 seconds or maybe even 10 minutes sometimes, just luck). My earliest memory with this problem when I was like 3 years old, I remember accidentally swallowing a gummy whole and it was stuck in my throat, for some reason I vividly remember spitting into a trash can as I was watching finding Nemo lmfaooo, I don\u2019t remember how it went down but I guess it did. Another time when I was 10, I was eating rice with chicken in it, when I got (probably) a piece of chicken lodged in my throat, and it wouldn\u2019t go down for like 20 minutes. Since then, I\u2019ve chewed my food a lot because I\u2019m scared of it happening. It\u2019s happened a lot since then too. When I told my parents about it they thought the whole thing was a psychological problem, and that I\u2019m too scared to chew my food less because I\u2019m afraid of the \u201cfeeling\u201d of getting food stuck in my throat. Matter of fact they thought the \u201cfeeling\u201d of getting food impacted in my throat was all in my head which pisses me off. since then when it has happened, I\u2019ve just locked myself in the bathroom until it goes down and don\u2019t tell my parents.\n\nFast forward 3 weeks ago, I was eating chicken, and it got stuck in my throat. I locked myself in the bathroom, and it just wouldn\u2019t go down. I told my mom about it and long story short I just ended up sleeping on it. Sure enough I wake up the next morning, and it\u2019s still not gone down. Didn\u2019t get any sleep that night. \n\nI tell my dad about it and he refuses to believe that something is wrong, he says it\u2019s \u201cin my stupid head\u201d. After a solid 30 minutes of begging to take me to the doctor he makes me an appointment. (This was all in a school night/day) so that morning my mom made the appointment and I go to school and get picked up early.\n\nI see the doctor and he refers us to a gastroenterologist so I go another day without eating or drinking lol\n\nI wake up the next day feeling like shit because I hadn\u2019t ate anything and we went to the gastroenterologist. Literally as I sit in the lobby waiting to be called the chicken finally goes down my throat, I tell my mom, and she decides to get me checked out anyways because she wants to know what\u2019s wrong with me.\n\nWe go to the gastroenterologist, he wants me to get an esophagram done, so we do that. We get the results and they believe that I have eosinophilic esophagitis, and tell us to come back for further evaluation. They said that there is narrowing present in my esophagus.\n\nFelt amazing for my parents to finally know that something is wrong with me and I\u2019m not just crazy LMFAO. The doctors want me to get my esophagus dilated, which I\u2019m scared to do ngl \ud83d\udc80.

It's like the reaction gets restarted every day around the same time I had eaten the cookie \\~48 hrs prior. I'll notice my symptoms getting worse around that time, and then gradually improve over the next day until evening comes around again and the whole cycle starts over (until I stop eating the food of course).\n\nSomething else I noticed was that the volume of food seems to make a difference.

I wanted to share my story because I am at a weird stage in my journey with health issues. Basically, I woke up one day with pain/pressure in my upper abdomen 4 years ago. Incredibly, I have woken up with it (or a version of it) everyday since. It is something I live with and put with every day, yet it does not stop me from living my life. It feels like a always-present fullness/pressure that will never leave me. I am just so used to it at this stage and want to feel okay gain. Mornings usually feel best. I have sought treatment but nothing has made a real impact. Things like drinking a cup of water in the morning add to my pain - I\u2019m not convinced my issues are food related. I have undergone 2 endoscopies and have a handful of diagnoses under my belt, regardless, I still feel there is something missing. \n\nCurrent Symptoms - Burning Epigastric pain when hungry (middle of abdomen under ribs), Persistent Abdominal Pressure made worse by eating/drinking, Gas, Constant Burping after swallowing, Regurgitation, Food Compaction Scares, Acid Reflux, Constipation.  \n\nKnown Issues: EoE, GERD, Gastritis, SIBO, Possibly IBS or IBD?\n\nNote: Stress makes symptoms worse as you can imagine. \n\nTimeline: \n\n2017 - Really bad symptoms listed above, went to school doc. Thought maybe it was an internal injury.\n     - Positive for H Pylori Infection\n     - Eradicated H Pylori Triple Therapy  \n     - Felt better but not cured whatsoever\n\n2018 - Diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis via Endoscopy\n- Attempted Treatment with PPIs, fiber, Flovent Inhaler, Probiotics, and GasX for years with no real change.

I can best describe it as such: you know how a baby spits up their food? Well I do that consistently. Multiple times every day. Normally I just re-chew and swallow (similar to a cow chewing cud). Gross, I know. However this has been a normal thing my entire life so I don't even realize I do it.\n\nI was in the lower economic class growing up so DR visits were normally reserved for emergencies. However, to my parents credit, they did consistently take me to numerous different DR about my spitting up and none of them could give a satisfactory answer. My favorite was the one who said it was entirely a self-induced mental symptom and to try and bribe me to get me to stop. (ie I'll give you a Snickers if you don't spit up today). I vividly remember joking with my mom that it meant I could just lie consistently for free candy then \ud83d\ude02. (Remember, I would regurgitate small mouthfuls and just swallow it again so if you weren't paying attention you wouldn't even notice).\n\nFinally, as a teenager, my parents found a DR who listened and would actually run tests. I specifically remember doing a Barium Swallow among numerous other tests until finally the DR ordered an Upper endoscopy. My father was an observer for the procedure (I was still a minor and this was late 1990s) and I remember waking up during the procedure and choking because the camera was in my throat. During this procedure, they noticed a hiatal hernia and the sphincter muscle located between the esophagus and stomach refused to work. Basically I had nothing keeping my food down so the DR said he could give me a glass of water then grab me by the get and there would be nothing keeping the food in my stomach. They recommended things such as sleeping with head elevated and daily antacid medication Zantac.\n\nAs I had no major symptoms other than minor regurgitation daily which had no noticable negative repercussions, we accepted this diagnosis and I proceeded into adulthood. \n\nFast forward 10-15 years and, other than numerous daily regurgitation, I've lived a relatively healthy life. Occasionally I had minor food impacting that I could get to pass on my own. I just figured this was due to me not chewing good enough and as nothing was hospital worthy I went about my life.\n\nEventually I went home to visit my mother. She made a roast and I remember the very first bite getting stuck in my throat. I spent hours attempting to get it to pass on my own. Couldn't induce vomiting nor could I force it down. In fact I couldn't even swallow my own spit as this would build up pressure in my throat and cause MASSIVE pain. Eventually I gave in and went to the ER. They did a scope to remove the blockage and biopsy revealed elevated eosinophil count. Got referred to a GI doctor who diagnosed EoE.\n\nDuring this time in my life, (2015-2020 ish) I was living in a massive retirement type community and the GI doctor I had didn't like the idea of surgery or anything \"invasive\" to treat my symptoms ( I kept hearing things about how I was so \"young\" and didn't want to have surgery which could have complications that would haunt me the rest of my life, I was early 30s at the time) and basically pushed my concerns off to the side. As I had other, more pressing concerns going on in my life I, I felt as though the DR was ignoring me, and my symptoms were minor in my eyes, I eventually quit going.\n\nNow we've finally reached the present. New area, new phase in life and one trip to the ER later I end up with a new GI doctor. I've already had a follow-up endoscopy (Daily Omeprazole and still elevated count) and now we're doing the swallowing Flovent part with followup endoscopy. Still early in the treatment but at least it's progressing. Thankfully my DR believes me about possible hiatal hernia as both endoscopies with him did not reveal a \"pouch\". Apparently it can slip and isn't always there. However the fact that I can eat a hotdog for lunch and then regurgitate bite sized chunks 6 hours later helps back up my story (apparently food should be past your stomach and into your intestines within an hour or so). \n\nI still have no idea what my trigger foods are as I've had minor impactions (I consider anything I manage to self pass within 10 minutes to be minor) consistently, however roast has sent me to the ER twice so the wife is refusing to cook it now in spite of my protests (it just tastes so good though lol). I still regurgitate daily (hourly may be better description). I notice having liquids in my stomach exacerbates the issue (I'll spit up a mouthful of sweet Tea every 5 minutes (accompanied with or without food) until it finally passes through my stomach). The wife is thankfully empathetic to the situation and simply jokes about me chewing my cud like a cow instead of being grossed out over me chewing and swallowing my vomit (it sounds so disgusting putting it this was though...)\n\nI appreciate whoever managed to make their way through this giant wall of text and I am open to thoughts/comments on my symptoms /situation. Hopefully it was readable as sleeping medicines have caused me to drift in and out of thought trains\n\nTL/DR: Wife says I'm a cow", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2800, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My EoE story (Long wall of text, sorry)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/qlq1t1/my_eoe_story_long_wall_of_text_sorry/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Grand_Pea_3306", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4x6mgfut", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1635871436, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ql8edp/do_furrows_rings_inflammation_stay_even_after/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ql8edp", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ql8edp/do_furrows_rings_inflammation_stay_even_after/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1635871448, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just got home from a scope where I had removed wheat and dairy and the images looked pretty bad and had the worst linear furrows I\u2019ve seen to date.

Trying to make it as short as possible so please bear with me! I would love any similar experiences or insight you guys have. \n\nI was diagnosed with EOE in June after having trouble swallowing and food impaction off-and-on my entire life (26F). The gastro immediately put me on 40mg omeprazole 1x day. I was scheduled for a follow up dilation 4 weeks later. At that one, he said my throat looked great, I'm responding very well, and he barely had to do anything to finish my dilation. The procedure and the PPIs changed my life- I could swallow, no heartburn, it didnt take 20 seconds for water to slowly make it's way down my throat!! It was amazing.\n\nHowever, I know there's pretty nasty side effects with long term PPI use and asked the allergist what other methods could work. I was told finding my food trigger and eliminating it would stop the symptoms as well. I was told it's probably a top 6 food, likely dairy. So I'm currently eliminating the omeprazole and dairy for 6 weeks, then getting another scope/biopsy. If EOE is still present id eliminate gluten, then soy, and so on. \n\nHere's the thing\n \nI'm only on day 6 of no omeprazole &amp; no dairy and I feel my symptoms coming back. I've been having heartburn since day 3, and yesterday and today I've noticed trouble swallowing foods, medication, and even water. I'm also having the annoying throat gurgling noises again.  I'll be calling the allergist tomorrow but I'm just SO frustrated. I don't know if this means it's not dairy and it's something else, or since it's all coming back so fast without the meds maybe it's a bunch of allergens...Am  I going to need to be on this medicine for the rest of my 50+ years of life and risk all the awful side effects? I don't have an issue with medicine but I have a different medical condition (PCOS) that has me on long term birth control and metformin. I was hoping to avoid adding yet another chemical into me body. \n\nHas anybody else here found their food trigger/triggers and had relief with avoiding the food (no medication)?

My paternal grandfather suffered some esophagus condition (don\u2019t know his exact diagnosis though). Ditto for my Dad.\n\nMy whole life I (36M) have dealt with food occasionally getting stuck. Several times a week I will feel something get stuck, and need to take a big gulp of water to wash it down. Infrequently (1-3 times a year) that doesn\u2019t work and I end up needing to wait (usually an hour or so) until it goes down on its own. When that happens, nothing can get down at all; I have to stay in the bathroom and spit into the sink, since I can\u2019t even swallow my own saliva.  A few years ago I finally got sick of this happening, and got an endoscopy. They diagnosed me with EE, and told be to try omeprazole to see if that made a difference for my symptoms (it didn\u2019t seem to). At that point my doctor told me that either they could do another scope to confirm that the omprazole wasn\u2019t helping, and then consider other treatments, or I could leave it untreated for now, and reconsider if it seemed to get any worse. Since my condition is really just a minor nuisance to me and not at all debilitating, so I went with the latter. \n\nAnyway, the other day my son (12) got a piece of food stuck in his throat (and just like me, couldn\u2019t even swallow water or his own saliva). After a couple hours it still had not gone down, so we took him to the ER. While there he told the doctors he gets food stuck in his throat frequently, but this is the first time it had ever not gone down on its own with a minute or so (I never knew that about him, but in hindsight, he does abruptly leave the dinner table occasionally to go to the bathroom. I never connected the dots...). They scheduled him for an endoscopy in the morning, but sometime over night it finally went down on its own. They did the endoscopy anyway, and diagnosed him with EE as well. His doctor wants to try omeprazole, and cut wheat and diary from his diet, then do another endoscopy in three months.\n\nThis seems like overkill to me - having to go under general anasthesia for the endoscopy is a scary (I want to say traumatic, but I wouldn\u2019t go that far...) experience for a kid, and the restrictive diet sounds like a bigger quality of life issue than the minor nuisance of his symptoms.

I have had major dysphagia for a long time - food sticking constantly and full impaction more than 100 times in my life (feels like brain freeze in the chest!!), including trips to the ER to get it unstuck.  Got an endoscopy 15 years ago, doc saw a stricture, and when he went to push the scope through it, my esophagus tore.  I was admitted to hospital immediately and next day had to do all kinds of weird barium x-rays to see if the tear went completely through.  It hadn't, so they sent me home.  My chest hurt for 4 months.  Anyway, the doc said he would never dilate me and told me to just eat slow.\n\nI now eat slow enough that I don't get impaction, but it takes me 45 minutes to eat a sandwich, for example.  I chew everything until it's like baby food. Recently I found new doctor, and first learned about EOE.  He did upper endoscopy, and said I had all the classic signs of EOE: furrows, rings, and a stricture, where the opening in my esophagus is only 7 mm (about the size of a pencil).  He said I had no signs of reflux, and since my problem started at age of 19, he is sure it's EOE and not GERD.  When they got the biopsy results they called me and said I had the highest level of eosinophils they had ever measured (125).  \n\nSo they want me to do swallowed steroids.  I am confused though:  they prescribed the dry powder version, but all the studies I am reading about say to use the aerosol version.  Is there a mistake?\n\nAlso, I cannot swallow pills, they always get stuck.  Do other people with EOE have to take only liquid medications?  Are there PPI's that are liquid if I end up taking those in the future?  Can I grind up pills otherwise?\n\nAny other advice?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1451, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Severe EOE, and some questions", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/hvnexr/severe_eoe_and_some_questions/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ladywith4cats", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2hyycauo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595304078, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/hv0hju/allergic_to_too_many_things_new_doc/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hv0hju", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/hv0hju/allergic_to_too_many_things_new_doc/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1595374291, "score": 1, "selftext": "My new primary just told me that I could not possibly be allergic to/ have a eoe trigger to as many things as a told him. \n\nHave any of you had a similar experience and had a productive patient doctor relationship afterwards?

It started with an acute bout of nausea, cramping, vomiting, (maybe fever), almost like the flu followed by what I like to call consta-rrhea (constipation followed by diarrhea). This was also the first week in 3 years I went off of allergy pills because I was getting allergy tested that week and for that you have to avoid all antihistamines. After that I also would have occasional globus feeling and first the first time in my life extreme unmanageable heartburn.  The acute nausea episodes happened about six times until December when I decided to eliminate gluten from my diet because I noticed that the majority of the times I had a flare-up it was the day after a party or holiday so lots of bread, pasta, beer, etc. And blam-o no more acute episodes. Present day- when I have gluten about 30 mins later I get globus and then within a few hours to the next day I get heartburn and then in two days I have a psoriasis flare up and while I'm in this inflamed state *all* food gives me bloating, stomach cramps, brain fog, headaches, constipation and alternative diarrhea. Back in Feb, I had an upper endoscopy and blood work both of which my GI doc said excluded PPI-EOE as well as celiacs. He also said it couldn't be EOE because my *main* complaint wasn't globus. He told me I had infectious IBS -\\_\\_- and that it would go away on its own and to not avoid gluten.  He put me on 80 mg of PPIs for a couple months while consuming gluten and during this time I didn't have any acute bouts, but I felt like shit (cramping, bloating, etc)- I was consuming so much pepto-bismol my poops turned black! So how long after eating gluten do you have globus, heartburn, etc? If you have PPI-EOE and not EOE, do PPIs eliminate all your symptoms or just upper GI? How long does it take to normalize? Can you get a negative on a scope and still be positive? The doc claims that he checked the eosinophils levels, but it's not in my chart and he wouldn't tell me the number.   \n\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1425, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "GI doc says negative for EOE, but I don't know what else it could be :(", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/hqnchx/gi_doc_says_negative_for_eoe_but_i_dont_know_what/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SmiteDuCouteau", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_lvryg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594662809, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/hqk4mt/tests_for_food_sensitivity/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hqk4mt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/hqk4mt/tests_for_food_sensitivity/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1594662840, "score": 1, "selftext": "It's been taking me a very long time to see a specialist, so I'm doing my best to keep to a very strict elimination diet.\n\nHas anyone had experience with tests like Everlywell for food sensitivity?

So I\u2019ve been diagnosed since January of last year. Food was getting stuck, only minority, at first. I was given fluticasone to swallow, which did nothing. It started to get worse, further scopes and testing showed the eosinophils were all over the place and much higher. I was given budenoside back in October, which did the job after an intense series of maintenance. I was told I could ease off of it. No problems other than my gastroparesis and the odd really bad acid reflux. \n\nA month ago I was eating and got that familiar tightness. I sipped at some water and thought maybe I wasn\u2019t chewing enough. Within 3 days I started having a hard time swallowing pills...one of which is for my eosinophilic disorders. I managed To get them down. \n\n2 weeks ago I had my first really bad episode. I tried to take a relatively small iron capsule, and I swallowed it and I don\u2019t even think it made it even 1/4 of the way down, I gagged and I lost it somewhere in my room cause it went flying lol...took the budenoside and inhalers aggressively for a week then started to taper them off this past Tuesday. Today I\u2019ve choked on everything I\u2019ve eaten, and I\u2019ve had to fight to get my pills down. Why does nothing seem to work regularly? I\u2019m very careful to not over medicate. My doctor has taught me how to taper and I know when I\u2019m good to stop a medication. I just had an ultrasound because I\u2019ve been in the ER 3 times in the past 2 months with 9/10 pain.

Hope it helps someone.  I pasted this together from some med history so it may not read that great.  All of this is of course IMHO and meant to help.\n\nI have always had a pretty good diet.  No processed foods, no soda, not much sugar.  Vegetarian for 20+ years.  No previous health issues at all, I never even get colds.  Was a \u201cskinny\u201d kid usually around 140 in high school, and maybe max 160 pounds, at 6 feet.  Never had a great stomach.\n\nStarted having food get stuck in my esophagus around October 2013.  My first episode is very clear in my memory.  I got an apple stuck on a hike 3+ miles from the car.  Tried a big drink of water which backed up into my lungs.  Couldn\u2019t breath and my vision started to blur like in the movies.  I thought I was dying and so did my GF watching helpless.  I prob was as I could not breathe.  I finally got myself to throw up and I got it out.  I was ok for a bit but within a few months it got to the point of every meal something stuck or was really difficult.  Looking back I was also having lots of gas and bloating.  So much burping.  \n\nHad an endoscopy and stretch June 2014. Scope showed I was almost swollen shut where the stomach and esophagus meet.  Scope also showed white blood cells - Eosinophils.  Doctor said it was heartburn and gave me some PPIs.  He briefly mentioned being tested for food allergies, but just off handed.  Like a lot of us have heard they just said - heartburn.  Like a lot of you my first thought was I have never been allergic to anything in my life.  My second thought was that I have never actually been tested.  I think we tend to think of things like peanut allergies where we would eat something and immediately get violently ill.  But we know from seasonal allergies that there are levels to it.\n\nSo I go to the allergy doctor.  Skin test showed allergic to 60% of all foods tested on the large 78 panel!  They had to snap a pic of my back for me to even believe them.  They followed the skin test up with two different blood tests and both were different from each other, and different from the skin test.  Some foods that were high in skin showed 0 on blood and vice versa.  Also showed allergic to dogs - I do have a dog and grew up with a dog with no real issue.  I do notice now though that short hair dogs do bug me.  Allergy doctor diagnosis is eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) caused by food allergies.  His clue was that my tests were all different.\n\nI hate taking any pharms but I was desperate.  Tried flovent for several months with no effect.  Did 6 week full elimination diet (did all 55 odd foods!). I ate mostly plain eggs and natural hash browns.  No spices or anything.  Even rice was on my list as allergic.  Had a hard carb crash since as a veggie I hate a ton of bread, pasta, etc which was now all gone - plus I was starving.  I could feel my stomach bacteria change.  Pounds continued to drop off.  My GF tried to do it with me and she made it less than 2 weeks (she took the low carb thing really hard).  I did all 6 weeks strictly.  Not much difference but some, my stomach seemed worse. Laid on the couch most of the summer just feeling terrible.\n\nTried sublingual immunotherapy.  No difference at all.\n\nSaw a naturopath who said I had protozoa living in the small intestine.  Made sense to me as my stomach was just horrible.  Also showed food allergies but again different foods.  Interesting thing here is things like cold water fish, turkey, and wild meat like venison was what he said I should eat.  Refused to eat meat still.  Tried several different natural remedies for parasites/protozoa.  During choking episodes when trying to clear the obstruction I would try throwing up and would get blobs that looked stringy inside and felt almost like jellyfish.  I know now prob white blood cells but at the time I thought it was bugs or something.  BMs are terrible.  Constipation and blood.\n\nWent to regular Dr and based on my travel history he said let's see if it is bugs in the gut.  I had lost 9 pounds in a month bringing me down to under 150 which got his attention.  Tired aggressive courses of Flagyl.  No difference at all.  Also had 2 courses of anti-worm pills (forget the names) but no help. Fugus, yeast? Lots of research. Took Diflucan for 5 days and this is the first thing that seemed to help stomach issues that were now worse than ever.  Continued Diflucan every 3 days for a month.  Had severe bloating when I ate any kind of carb or sugar (was tracking foods now very carefully).  Taking a Diflucan was like letting the air out a balloon.  Would feel better for a day or two then it would come back.  Continue the battery of tests - tested negative for Celiac, H pylori, stool test for fungus, and normal blood tests all fine. \n\nStarted feeling more and more lost.  I felt like I was not digesting my food very well and not getting the vitamins from it.  Doing lots of research and trying everything.  Staring really noticing how much I clear my throat while eating (I hear people in restaurants do this now - I think it is a big sign to help you find foods your body does not like).  Heavy flem build up.  I also have sinus draining almost every morning.  \n\nWent to one of the best digestive health centers in the country at OSU.  Had another scope so they could biopsie 3 different parts of my esophagus.  They diagnosed it as EE (EoE now I see it called more).  They want me to start the PPIs again.  Started taking Protonix (40mg) which helped with the feeling of getting stuck near the stomach but I still felt like top of throat has issues.  But the worst is they still just give me a headache every day at 3 like clockwork.  Dr says prob not it but I know it is and stop taking them.  Really start pushing the Dr.  I tell them diet seems to help more than anything.  She says yes, diet is the best course.  I ask then why didn't you start with telling me that!  Her answer is that no one will actually change their diet.  I have found this to be true for most people actually.  Heck my step dad is going to lose his foot to diabetes but he still keeps eating crap.  This point is key later.\n\nContinue to lose weight all the way down to 140!  About 2016 at this point.  Working out 5 days a week and getting nowhere.  Feel terrible.  I start to try many different vitamins and lots of probiotics.  Zygest is a great digestive from Puritans Pride.  VSL #3 is a crazy strong probiotic - expensive but really works to reset the body.  Yakult is also great - still take that every day.  These feel like they are helping.\n\nI start doing lots of research on diet.  EoE, IBS, Chrons, etc all make reference to carbs, esp high glycemic carbs.  Did you know a slice of bread has almost double the glycemic value of a snickers bar!  I had been off bread at this point for a bit but noticed rice is still terrible.  Then I cut potatoes, one of few things I did not test allergic to, and start to feel better.  I start going low carb, which means eating meat.  I start small and get used to it.  I do not go full Keto or anything as vegetable carbs are just fine for me.  Start really increasing protein in all my meals.  Still mostly veggie with lots of beans and such.  Start to realize how much vegetarians ignore protein.  You do not need 600 grams a day but 25 does not cut it either.  Look at books like Grain Brain.  In the end I find that my big 4 are wheat, rice, potatoes, and corn.\n\nI start to eat really healthy, like super mega healthy.  Thought I was before but nothing like now.  Think Tom Brady diet (do not like the guy but his diet is proof).  Load up on the probiotics.  It is year 4 or 5 at this point..and I finally start to feel better.  Finally start gaining weight back.  At the gym 5 days a week and finally start gaining some muscle.  Even my GF is feeling great.  Her skin is clear for the first time in her life.  I start to have almost no reactions.  Digestion is smooth and easy.  Never thought my system could run this good!  \n\nI track my food with My Fitness Pal.  Find I am only eating about 1,700 calories a day.  I start with protein shakes (Orgain or Evolve), bars (like Think), bowls of yogurt and quinoa based granola at night.  I eat even when I do not want to.  I can only get up to about 2,200 to 2,400 when pal says I need 3,000.  Only way I get over 2,500 is some nice 300 calorie IPAs.  (Yes I can drink beer no problem but i do find the gluten reduced ones help and taste great - GF beer not so much.)   \n\nOver the next 2 years I gain back 25 pounds (now almost 30).  All muscle too.  At almost 45 I have a six pack, can do 20+ pullups, feeling great.  Paleo, low carb, etc gets more popular and I can eat out again.  I can now even cheat here and there like pizza if my parents are in town.  My throat is ok with it but my stomach still complains.  I pretty much lost any taste for things like that now anyway.  I just know how it will make me feel.  So now I cheat with sweet potato fries instead of regular.  Flourless chocolate cake is better than regular anyway :).  \n\nNow in year 7 I feel pretty stable at about 167 pounds.  Still want to gain a little more weight but it is hard when you eat healthy.  Stronger every day but of course stuck at home now.  Doing 100 pushups a day.  I am even trying to train for American Ninja Warrior - what a turn around.  My diet has settled in at something like low carb mediterranean.  I like recipes from whole 30, paleo, and modified keto also.  Keto ones just need a lot more veggies.  I finally feel like I can beat, or at least tame, this beast of a disease.  Yes I still have issues at times.  Mostly when I cheat then forget to chew as well the next day. Eat slow!  Better to enjoy it anyways.  Do not try to keep up with others.  I would say I am down to 4-8 times a year though. I take absolutely no prescriptions of any kind.  No need.  I do find cannabis really helps to reduce inflammation, help calm the system, helps appetite and digestion.  Both CBD and THC help with 1:1 mixes really helping.  Of course you cannot use this all day but before dinner can really help if you are hurting.  Note I am in a legal state so it is easier to find tinctures and such to dial it in.\n\nSo in the end diet is the key.  Just see how many people on here controlling it post about diet.  While I do think my diet would help most people you need to find what your body likes and doesn\u2019t like.  For example I can eat dairy just fine while a lot of people on here say they cannot.  It is not easy to figure out either.  Ever have it where you do not react to dinner but eating the same leftovers fo lunch and you do?  That drove me nuts.  Inflammation works that way though.  Best I heard is, it is like a glass of water.  You can add for a while but eventually the glass is full.\n\nRecent articles on here like about SPINK7 and such point to us not having natural protection against inflammatory foods.  This makes sense since the best diets I try, and see on here, are low inflammation.  Just recently the CURED Foundation said in their annual report said something similar.  They called it leaky esophagus where we lack the natural protection from inflammatory foods.  They leak through, our body sees it happen, so it send in the forces (white blood cells).  So again not eating bad foods to begin with is the key. \n\nI am NOT saying it is easy.  But you have to say goodbye to bread, pizza, soda, and all that other junk.  You have to get over wanting to go back to normal like everyone else. In the end this may be the hardest part.  This is not going away, there is no cure, this is for life.  That took me a long time to get over. Pause here to let that sink in.\n\nYou have to realize your body is not wrong - it is trying to tell you something!  No one can actually eat garbage, it is just that our bodies are more sensitive to it.  You can treat this like a curse or a gift.  My body is really good at warning me what I am eating is crap - and in the end it changed my life for the better.  Even if they come up with a miracle drug or cure now I would still eat super healthy for the rest of my life.

Been reading through posts and I\u2019m glad I joined!\n\nI had a couple questions of my own if any with similar experiences can comment...\n\n1) While dysphasia is obviously a concern, the symptom that\u2019s always been worst for me is panic attacks and trouble sleeping related to the feeling that I\u2019m choking (not while eating food). Ive been told that this is largely related to anxiety and I agree with this. Has anyone else experienced this symptom? If so, what are your strategies for mitigating that anxiety/discomfort so you can get to sleep or get on with your day? Ive tried some breathing techniques but was wondering if anyone had any tricks. \n\n2) Broadly, what approaches from doctors have worked for you? Ive had a few different GIs over the years and they\u2019ve given me some contradicting advice. I tried the 6 food elimination diet on the recommendation of one GI for a few months and didn\u2019t have much success. Then I moved and got a new doctor that came highly recommended and specializes in EoE and he didn\u2019t seem to think elimination diets worked outside a clinical setting. He just prescribed me steroids and PPIs and scoped me, and is now weaning me off those meds with plans for another scope.

I've had some interesting responses from PCPs in regards to my EoE diagnosis and was wondering about other people's experiences with their general practitioners. I was diagnosed 2 years ago and have been well taken care of by an amazing GI and allergist, all symptoms are well managed with being careful when I eat and steroids from time to time. \n\nI've jumped around PCPs a few times and have mentioned that diagnosis to two new doctors on my first appointment (not b/c I have symptoms but more like hey this is my history but I'm doing okay). Both seemed suppperrr skeptical about the diagnosis but also like they had never heard of it? And most interestingly they both kind of discounted it and said my eating difficulties are more likely related to my mild anxiety.\n\nHas anyone else had a doctor relate the difficulties swallowing with anxiety? \n\nI found it super confusing. I mean it's not like I just have a little trouble swallowing, I had the full blown horrific chest pain and having to regurgitate food that's stuck in the throat (no ER visits thankfully). And I had five EGDs, all consistently showing tons of eosinophils. Both PCPs found it super strange that i had some many scopes, even though that seems like common practice to find food triggers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, anyone else feel like primary care doctors don't even know Eoe exists? Do they question your diagnosis, even after it's being managed by other doctors? Do they related it to anxiety? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your input and responses!

Never posted here yet, but read here from time to time.  Just wanted to share my story and get some advice.  Skip to the end if you just want to see the current plan  and give feedback on that plan.\n\nHistory - 37 year old male.  5'10\", currently 158 lbs.  No other conditions other than mild high blood pressure (usually around 130/80 but it varies a lot).  I wonder if it's possible if the high BP comes from chronic inflammation.  Anyway.\n\nSymptoms - main - chronic sore throat.  Have had this daily for 4 years.  Driving me nuts.  Difficulty swallowing - not terrible, but meat requires lots of water and taking care. Had ER from impaction ONCE IN 2018.  Cleared on its own after 1.5 hours.  Have sharp stomach pains sometimes.  Have had this weird back pain for 2-3 years, not bad but doesn't go away.  Numb spot, can turn into a sharp pain.  Around 1 year ago, lost 10-16 lbs without trying, weight  stayed off but holding steady (went from 172 to as low as 153...normally I'm around 158 now).  2 months ago, stools changed to smaller pieces instead of larger (sorry for TMI!).  Main thing is I don't feel well, can't shake the sore throat, and lost some weight.\n\nBefore I get into my story, suspicion of possible \"causes\" of my EoE.  Most likely causes, in my opinion, in bold.\n\n**- chronic bronchitis and breathing issues as a child due to farm dust exposure**\n\n**- accutane usage in my teens for severe acne**\n\n\\- **acute  drug overdose** @ 20 years old - alcohol, ephedra, cocaine, marijuana - 12 hr hospitalization until heart rate recovered to \"normal\".  Symptoms started weeks after this, but I did also have an illness/virus in between there and when symptoms started.\n\n\\- possible Lyme disease (doubt it)\n\n\\- was diagnosed as having CMV (cytomegalovirus) but this was not until 2013 and I had been having symptoms for years already...possibly exacerbated them though?  Not sure\n\n\\- **alcohol intolerance**\n\nHave had symptoms since around 2003. Started just having more consistent GI issues while in college.  Weird rash around eyes after getting out of the shower.  Actually tested positive for Lyme's disease?  Don't think I ever actually had it though.  I just remember complaining about health issues in school. Girlfriends complaining I was sickly.  That kind  of thing.\n\nI remember 2007 the first \"really bad\" heartburn I  ever had.  A night of drinking.  DEEP heartburn, felt in the back.  I remember it  vividly.  I do still get this DEEP heartburn every now and then if I eat the wrong thing.\n\nStarted getting worse hangovers from alcohol starting around 2006.  Possible  alcohol itolerance?  My brother has severe alcohol intolerance.  My tolerance is getting worse and worse.  Can't handle as much before feeling a buzz.  Can't drink as much without  getting a hangover.\n\nDiagnosed with EOE in 2015 after an upper and lower scope.  Was on omeprazole for 2-3 years before weaning off in 2017 or 2018.\n\nI'vehad so many tests done over the last 15 years or so...barium  swallow, upper and lower endoscopy, MRI for my back issue, blood tests.\n\n**Current Plan**\n\n**Acid Suppression** \\- Saw my allergist recently and he says I should go on an acid suppression drug (again).  Day 1 I took omeprazole but then read that famotidine 2x daily might be better for EoE, since it also has an allergy blocking component.  So days 2 and 3 I took famotidine.  I felt like absolute hell this morning.  Like the acid was just **TRYING so hard** to form in my stomach.  Like I could feel it in my throat.  I think I want to discontinue the famotidine already.  Maybe talk to my GI person before taking any more acid suppression drugs.  I am a little scared of long term side-effects.  In the past I took omeprazole for 2-3 years  but it caused joint pain and I wanted to get off of it.  It was tough but I did it!  Haven't taken any acid suppression for 2 years or so.  I don't really get HEARTBURN much unless I eat wrong (then I can get it BAD) but the sore throat just won't quit.  So I'm torn on whether to do any acid suppression, but the allergist says that's basically the foundation of treatment for EoE right now.\n\n**Swallowed steroid** \\- switching from swallowed Flovent to swallowed Budesonide slurry.  Just to try something different, really.  I haven't had any scopes since using Flovent (past 2 years or so) but it has not helped the sore throat whatsoever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Appointment with  GI upcoming** \\- to discuss  acid suppression and more scopes and further the \"plan.\"  Also ensure the weight loss is nothing serious.\n\n**Diet** \\- need to be  stricter with gluten free and dairy free.  I've definitely started eating healthier,but not super strict.  I'll cheat when I want.  Eat pizza, cheeseburger, etc.  Going to try to be 100% compliant.  Trying to decide which \"diet\" to follow.  To simplify, may just try eating meat, fruits, veggies, rice, water.  That's it.  Looked in the past at diets like anti-inflammatory, DASH, mediterranean, anti-reflux, SIBO, low FODMAP.  Thought about making a spreadsheet with all of these diets and foods listed and see which foods cross-reference on to all of the lists and eating only those.  have had allergy tests (skin prick).  Food allergies unremarkable.  Moderate level food allergies for peanut, hazelnut (10 out of 15).\n\n**No alcohol** \\- I am a regular drinker.  Probably 7-10 drinks/week.  Going to try to go to zero, in case alcohol intolerance is really the root of all of this.\n\n**Environmental allergens?** \\- have had allergy tests (skin prick).  Food allergies unremarkable.  Moderate level food allergies for peanut, hazelnut (10 out of 15).  Environmental allergens to ragweed, oak trees, timothy grass, farinae dust mites, lambs quarter weed, cottonwood, maple tree, pteronyssinus dust mites, cockroach.  Don't really have many allergy \"symptoms\" like runny eyes/nose...just have a sore throat, really.  Don't currently take any allergy meds.  **Considering treating the house or at least the bedding for  dust allergies (special pillow cases and bedding).  I seem to be most allergic to dust, per the allergy tests.**\n\n**Bed -** considering raising head of the bed for acid reflux at night.\n\n**Other medications** \\- considering asking for one of the new  biologics, but unsure  yet.  My case seems severe to me, but less severe than what I read  about here.  No vomiting.  Only one major impaction (other minor ones).  Basically just feeling like crap, sore throat, and other GI symptoms but nothing severe.  Just intolerance to most foods anymore.\n\nAnyway - thanks for reading.  I'm trying to hang in there.  Just looking for direction.  What to try.  Where to turn.  I'm fed up with this but I know I haven't done my part  100% to be fully compliant either.\n\nThis condition sucks and I can't wait until the biologics are confirmed to work for EoE and we can hopefully be all free from this misery!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1892, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My story - looking for suggestions", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/kx9lpp/my_story_looking_for_suggestions/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Ok_Issue7602", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9f8un6t0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1610579844, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/kwsnd1/need_advice_respond/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kwsnd1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/kwsnd1/need_advice_respond/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1610580902, "score": 1, "selftext": "My doctor says I have Eoe and Eosinophilic Gastritis, I don\u2019t have difficulty swallowing or the feeling which something is stuck in my chest.

Currently 35/M with no major health issues other than gastritis that is usually under control. Had a skin allergy test that showed my only allergic reactions were to dust an dust mites (I know they are not reliable). \n\nWhen I was 20 I had my first EoE attack. It usually consist of a piece of meat (chicken or steak) and it felt stuck in my throat and wouldn't go down. Then my body reacted by throwing it up. But even after the food would come out, my body would gag and continue to throw up eve if there is nothing there. Eventually I am just throwing up bile or saliva. I would have this gagging sensation once every 5 minutes eventually but it won't stop for hours. Eventually I went to he ER where they would give me through IV a combination of zofran, robinul, and pepcid. An hour later, the gagging sensation would go away. Hospital would diagnose me with Acute vomiting, Hiatal hernia with GERD. Next day I would be fine to eat anything. I will prescribed Omeprazole 40mg and had been taking it on and off for the past 15 years (Trying to not depend on it).\n\nThis has happened to me 5 times in my life and as recently as 4 months ago. My recent endoscopy showed my esophagus was irritated from the acid reflux attack but biopsy didn't show anything serious other than some sort of inflammation. That is when my gastro told me that I may have possible EoE. He doesn't know what triggers it since I don't react to any foods instantly. But advised to do an elimination diet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

I thought maybe it was related to EoE?\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/Zp4fhGP", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1798, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spots In Throat", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/k8ah6m/spots_in_throat/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ScriScriz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_67tch5y6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1607306007, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/k873qw/elimination_diet_question/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k873qw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/k873qw/elimination_diet_question/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1607306018, "score": 1, "selftext": "*Hello Guys, I ve been avoiding all big 6 allergens for 4-5 weeks and gonna have a scope soon, if the diet worked and I have healed my esophagus hence hpf lower than 15 which of the big 6 do I introduce first? or it doesnt matter?*\n\nthanks", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1797, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Elimination Diet question", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/k873qw/elimination_diet_question/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LionRunner554", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_84rqobna", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1607300854, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/k85ork/how_was_your_diagnosis_confirmed/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k85ork", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/k85ork/how_was_your_diagnosis_confirmed/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1607300865, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI am so grateful for this thread.\n\nI am wondering how your doctor officially diagnosed you?\n\nMy pathology report came back with active esophagitis with intraepithelial eosinophils in the distal/mid esophagus. \n\nIt also states:\n\n\"The findings are consistent with primary EoE in the appropriate clinical setting.

Ever since I've been kind of perusing this subreddit for a while and found a lot of solace in all of your experiences, so thank you for sharing them with others!!\n\nMy EoE started when I experienced a LOT of throat pain during a cold. I am talking about an unbearable amount of throat pain. I talked to my GP and she didn't notice anything wrong, but because the symptoms persisted, she eventually gave me some PPI's, antibiotics and just general throat medicine, whatever that might be lol. After it kept persisting, she eventually sent me to do a gastroscopy, and 9 months later, they diagnosed me with EoE. During this time, the only real symptoms I had were oscillating throat pains (some days it was worse, some days better), hoarseness and acid reflux. Once I got my diagnosis, I was given local corticosteroids (budesodine I think) and no real further instructions. While they helped, a little, the situation wasn't really all that much better. I eventually got a hot tip that I should try eliminating dairy and gluten from my diet. After doing so, my throat improved dramatically and while I still experience hoarseness/pain sometimes, it is much better. I plan on doing a full elimination diet after my gastroscopy check-up which is in about a month to see if there are any other triggers present in the food I eat.\n\nSo, my question to all of you is, do you experience EoE without food blockages? Is it something that develops over time? Or was I just lucky enough to have it diagnosed before it developed to that stage?\n\nThank you everyone for reading and stay safe everyone!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1794, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does anyone have EoE but doesn't experience food blockages?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/k7czwv/does_anyone_have_eoe_but_doesnt_experience_food/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Arcane_Ronin", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8fesaka", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1607145471, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/k71q24/do_any_of_you_with_eoe_also_get_palpitations_or/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k71q24", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 23, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/k71q24/do_any_of_you_with_eoe_also_get_palpitations_or/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1607154782, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1792, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do any of you with EoE also get palpitations or tachycardia?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/k71q24/do_any_of_you_with_eoe_also_get_palpitations_or/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "JamesGreer13", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_56e488v", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1607126988, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/k6wyb9/i_can_only_drink_my_food_but_most_of_these/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k6wyb9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/k6wyb9/i_can_only_drink_my_food_but_most_of_these/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1607140202, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm trying everything, but nothing is helping my esophagus.

He gets upper endoscopies every 6-12 months depending on what his levels are at the previous biopsy during the EDG. His next EDG is next week. He's never been able to communicate his pain with eating, but lately, when he eats pancakes, he swallows really hard multiple times and needs a lot of drinks with them. I don't know if he's having a bad flair up because his last biopsy was good so it has been awhile since his levels were tested. I have let his GI doctor know what he is doing when he eats pancakes, and he doesn't do that with any other food. We can't do the elimination diet with him because he already is very limited on what he eats every day, and it would cause more harm than good. \nSo I guess my question is, do pancakes affect any of

been on and off PPIs etc. this year with my allergist i had c/o symptoms of these and she sent me to GI to rule out EoE, who scoped me and thought EoE and/or some form of eosinophilic gastritis was likely (i had changes in the upper and lower third of my esophagus + chronic gastritis) plus confirmed hiatal hernia. however, the surgical path report showed that my cells didn't have specific abnormalities other than the evidence of chronic gastritis. so we had ruled out EoE, wrote it off as moderate/severe GERD and restarted me on PPIs\n\nBUT i did start allergy shots and this is where i'm confused. i do notice that when i get the shots, i get intense heartburn and throat tightness. like something gets \"stuck\" in my throat for that whole day and it's really intense. i also recently had a terrible reaction to the cluster shots and i had terrible tightness + N/V/D the entire day. it usually gets better with time. however, I think it's very weird that I get these type of

Unlike existing PPIs which inhibit H+, K+-ATPase in [parietal cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/stomach-parietal-cell), vonoprazan directly inhibits H+\u2013K+ exchange on the gastric luminal surface. As a result, vonoprazan has greater acid inhibition via this alternative mechanism compared with existing PPIs. [\\[see this\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1607551X17303145#bib12)  \n\nThe healing rate after 2 weeks of treatment with vonoprazan (20\u2009mg once daily, 90.7%) was significantly higher than with lansoprazole (30\u2009mg once daily, 81.9%). Moreover, in patients with more severe esophageal lesions (Los Angeles Grade C/D disease), the healing rates were 98.7% vs. 87.5%, for vonoprazan and lansoprazole, respectively. [\\[see this for the trial\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4816037/#bib30) \n\nVonoprazan is more potent with a more long-lasting effect than that of PPIs \\[[this](https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-021-01822-5#ref-CR7), [and this](https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-021-01822-5#ref-CR8)\\].

that I think may be EOE related. \n\nI went to ER in may2020 with pain in the upper abdomen, they thought it was acid reflux, so I was prescribed PPI meds... they did nothing and everything for worse. Turns out I was low stomach acid... not high... developed GP because of the PPI meds... that was fun... got that corrected and doing better with that. Went through all the tests from ENDO to H-pylori, all negative\u2026 however they were never looking for EOE. My GI seemed to brush that off. What was happening was food was not digesting due to low stomach acid and sitting in my stomach rotting\u2026 then causing pressure on my LES and sometimes causing regurgitation in the middle of the nigh with reflux. Thankfully I\u2019m off ALL antacid meds since FEB and that has been great, supplementing with HCL/Enzymes/Bile and my digestion has improved. So that\u2019s a plus\u2026 \n\nNow, and since July 2020 I have been progressively getting this inflammation in the throat and esophagus that has been getting worse over the course of the last year. Started out with just a slight inflammation in the throat, went to the ENT, she did not see anything. Had several blood panels and did show some markers for autoimmune like RA ish popping up. This feeling however is not reflux (I know this now, was confused before). My GI just wanted me to take more and more PPI\u2026 that was clearly the wrong direction. \n\nSo after researching more on this, ever since I came back from my initial visit in May2020 I changed up my died to primarily revolve around proteins that were eggs, fish, and nuts\u2026. Yeah trigger foods apparently. I already don\u2019t eat wheat, dairy, or soy\u2026 so cutting those remaining possible items out today. \n\nThe best way I can describe the pain is like an internal inflammation that shows up 3-4 hours after I eat and when I wake up. This includes a dull burning in the throat, esophagus, and stomach sometimes. I have also started to struggle with pill swallowing. It has got to the point where the inflammation is almost 24/7\u2026 so nothing like acid reflux. \n\nMy current diet was already basically blended foods\u2026 but consisted upwards of 18 egg whites a day with some nuts and sometimes fish\u2026 With no improvement in these weird EOE like symptoms. So cutting those out immediately. \n\nOne of my clients has EOE and has been keeping it locked down for over 5 years with diet alone so I\u2019m hopeful that I can get back to a normal life. \n\nSidenote, found out my mom today has issues with eggs\u2026 she never really told me before and my son is highly allergic to eggs, both the yolk and white protein. \n\nThoughts, concerns, encouragement?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2422, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Possible EOE?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ol53b1/possible_eoe/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "whateverwhateverwut", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3al7fu5t", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626390446, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ol47vk/bloating_acid_reflux_and_more_issues_swallowing/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ol47vk", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ol47vk/bloating_acid_reflux_and_more_issues_swallowing/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1626390456, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi, I was diagnosed in 2017 with eoe and haven't really stuck to any treatment (i know, i just didn't like flovent and budesonide was too hard to remember to take twice a day) I do avoid two of my known triggers (corn &amp; pork.)\n\nlately i've been having more issues, like bloating, acid reflux, and more pain when swallowing. does anyone else get this way too? what helped?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2422, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Bloating, acid reflux and more issues swallowing (diagnosed 2017)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ol47vk/bloating_acid_reflux_and_more_issues_swallowing/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "jbail628", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_zqxpw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626282222, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ok8ouy/tired_of_egds_input_appreciated/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ok8ouy", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ok8ouy/tired_of_egds_input_appreciated/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1626282233, "score": 1, "selftext": "Dx via EGD biopsies in April 2021 after a few years of right, scratchy throat and feeling like I get pills/occasional food stuck in my throat - nothing too crazy; finally gave in and got scoped after developing new sensitivities to a LOT of foods.

In addition, case reports documented the spontaneous recurrence and remission of EoE during the pollen season [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309387/#R12). Whether there is seasonality to EoE may depend on the geographic location of the population [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309387/#R13),[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309387/#R14). However, what is clear is that EoE subjects have higher rates of aeroallergen sensitization than the general population [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309387/#R1).\n\nA recent case report of a child with house dust mite sensitization and difficult to manage EoE demonstrated that specific immunotherapy using dust mite antigen was useful in controlling EoE symptoms and histology [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309387/#R15). Whether this is generally true in patients with aeroallergen sensitization and/or whether aeroallergen immunotherapy could represent a new or adjunct treatment option in EoE remains to be systematically evaluated, but this issue may well warrant controlled trials and further study. In addition, recent animal model studies have documented that Aspergillus induced EoE can be reduced in mice that lack invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lack of an adequate response to elimination diets in some EoE patients implies that antigens other than food allergens play a role. Several lines of evidence suggest that aeroallergens are capable of triggering EoE. Murine models of EoE have been induced by initial sensitization followed by challenging mice with the corresponding aeroallergen.[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5135654/#R10) Many patients with EoE also have asthma and/or allergic rhinitis and are sensitized to environmental inhalant allergens as evidenced by positive SPT and increased ocular, nasal and/or chest symptoms during their corresponding pollen seasons.[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5135654/#R3) Clinical experiences also suggest that EoE symptoms worsen in some patients during the spring and/or fall pollen seasons and the correlation between EoE disease activity and seasonal aeroallergen exposure has been documented in isolated case reports and studies implying a seasonal pattern of EoE diagnosis.[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5135654/#R11) \u2013 [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5135654/#R12) Although esophageal aeroallergen exposure is miniscule in comparison to food allergen exposure, the ubiquitous nature of aeroallergens makes complete avoidance difficult. Suggested mechanisms for worsening of EoE during pollen seasons include exposure of the esophageal mucosa of the sensitized patient to the minute amounts of pollen inhaled into the nose or mouth and subsequently swallowed. In some patients ingestion of foods containing antigens that cross react with allergens in the pollens to which they are sensitized is suspected of playing a role.[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5135654/#R13) Often overlooked is the fact that allergic nasal mucous contains not only pollens, but sheets of eosinophils and the mediators that recruited them to the allergic reaction occurring in the nasal mucosa. Thus, it seems reasonable that repeatedly swallowing eosinophil rich nasal secretions might contribute to worsening of EoE, suggesting that aggressive treatment of allergic rhinitis in affected patients is warranted.\n\nTo further explore the potential role of aeroallergens in pediatric EoE, Kahey and colleagues elsewhere in this issue report their results from a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients diagnosed with EoE over a 10 year period extending through 2012 at New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center.[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5135654/#R14) They compared both the dates of initial symptoms and dates of diagnosis with pollen counts from two local certified NYC pollen-counting stations. They found that the highest number of pediatric EoE patients in this area reported symptoms onset in July \u2013 September, correlating with higher grass pollen counts at one station and higher ragweed pollen counts at the other. The highest number of pediatric patients was diagnosed with EoE from October \u2013 December.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso see;\n\n    Eosinophilic esophagitis treated with immunotherapy to dust mites.\n    Ramirez RM, Jacobs RL\n    J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2013 Aug; 132(2):503-4.\n    \n    Atkins D.

I was diagnosed with EOE in December 2020 as well as LPR.  My major symptoms include a constant urge to cough while eating anything (doesn't matter what it is, I'm always coughing through my entire meal) and throat clearing/feeling like there is mucus always stuck in the back of my throat after eating.  I have had a few instances of dysphagia over the years but this does not happen very often.  I was put on omeprazole in September 2020 which immediately cleared up my \"eating cough\" as I call it.  Because of the occasional dysphagia, an endoscopy was ordered and showed very high eosinophil count thus giving me the official EOE diagnosis.  \n\nAlmost immediately after the scope, the cough came back despite still taking omeprazole and not changing anything with my diet.  I was then put on Flovent to help with the cough which again, worked immediately.  At the advice of my doctor, I stopped Flovent at the end of March when I transitioned into the six food elimination diet but stayed on the omeprazole.  I followed the diet religiously for close to 12 weeks, had zero symptoms, and had another scope done about 2 1/2 weeks ago.  The biopsy did show a lower eosinophil count however, the cough came back within hours of the procedure.\n\nAt this point, I have only re-introduced soy &amp; wheat back into my diet.  I do believe that wheat is a trigger so I have cut that out again and have had very minimal soy.  I am basically back to my  elimination diet foods but still having this cough.  While I do believe that there are foods that are triggers, I can't help but wonder if the scope also maybe did something which is why the cough came back after both procedures.  Does that sound insane?  Hah.  I am just very frustrated at this point.  I want to figure out my triggers but it feels almost impossible when this cough won't go away and almost feels like it is getting worse.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2415, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Frustrated {elimination diet/symptoms}", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/oid62d/frustrated_elimination_dietsymptoms/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "theothermattm", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_14mqnvbw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626021235, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/oi7p1h/unused_elecare_jr_donate/", "gildings": {}, "id": "oi7p1h", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/oi7p1h/unused_elecare_jr_donate/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1626021247, "score": 1, "selftext": "We have five cans of sealed unopened elecare jr formula that our son needed when he was on a feeding tube for EoE this winter.

I am still waiting for biopsy results, but I had an EGD with dilation last week. From the EGD my GI said that my esophagus was severely inflamed and scarred. I have been having issues with impaction for years, at least a couple of times a week, and I was able to manage it with sparkling water. My mom actually had the same problem, and I remembwr that eggs would always cause her to get food impacted. I think that is why I didnt think much of this problem and didnt get it checked out sooner, because it just seemed normal to me. I dont know what her diagnosis was because she passed away when I was a teenager. Also, I dont know my medical history from when I was a child, but my mom told me that when I was little I would get \"acid reflux\"and vomitting from soy and dairy, but who knows because my mom cant answer that and my pediatrician office has archived all my records and wont look for them.Anyways, since the EGD and dilation last week I feel like my swallowing and impaction has gotten much more severe, it went from maybe 5-7 times a week, to everyday. I am not that upset about food, I can live off of smoothies for a while, and I have an appointment with my dietician tomorrow. I have several food restrictions, so I am used to it. I have IgE mediated allergies for almost all the common EoE trigger foods so I dont even know whats left to eliminate. The thing that I am struggling with now, is how do I take my medication??? I am on some medications for rheumatoid arthritis and I am worried about not being able to get my dosage and having a flair and the have more joint damage then I already have, and I am also on another med that can have miserable withdrawal symptoms. I am taking my meds one at a time, with lots of water, but I still cant seem to get them down. They end up being so painful that I just drink sparking water and burp/vomit them back up.

For years I've been battling GERD symptoms and it seems like I have to do more and more to achieve less. So I started working with a dietitian and she suspects I have EoE not GERD. After learning more about it I'm pretty sure she's  right. A lot of things that never made sense to me before would make a lot more sense with an EoE diagnosis.\n\nSo I identified eggs and cows milk as very likely triggers for me before I even knew what EoE was. Turns out those are two of the main offenders! Eliminating those has improved almost all of my symptoms but the worst one: esophagus pain.

My symptoms were heartburn, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing everything including saliva. The difficulty swallowing was by first the worst symptom and as days went on my throat became super sore. My primary care doctor prescribed me 40mg of Omeprazole while I waited for a referral to see a GI. I got Covid in November so I had to push back my GI appointment to December. Finally I saw my GI and he scheduled me for an Endoscopy. At the end of December I had my Endoscopy. When they woke me up they said they took biopsies and then they handed me a paper that said I had Esophagitis, Gasritus, and a Hiatal Hernia.\n\nI had my follow up appointment and the GI's assistant said the labs confirmed I had chronic Gasritus and grade A Esophagitis. She told me she was going to change my prescription to Nexium because the Omeprazole wasn't helping with my symptoms. She also put me on an elimination diet cutting out Caffeine, garlic, tomatoes, spicy foods, and dairy. The assistant said my hernia probably wouldn't need surgery and to stay on the elimination diet for 6 months. I tried the  the Nexium for a month and felt worse so I switched back to the Omeprazole.\n\nEven with the Omeprozole I get heart burn even with the elimination diet. I still think the elimination diet has been helping because ever since I started it the difficulty swallowing started happening less, but at the end of March I tried to introduce garlic back to my diet. Later that night I got some slight heart burn and the next day the difficulty swallowing flared back up. I removed garlic from my diet and about a week later the difficulty swallowing went away.\n\nToday I saw my Allergy doctor because of some unrelated stuff. I mentioned my difficulty swallowing and he stated my symptoms matched EOE.  He said the PPI treatment is failing and we both looked at the Endoscopy lab results which didn't rule out EOE. He stated the report didn't show a biopsy showing if any Eosinophils were found in the esophagus. He instructed me to get in contact with my GI to see if EOE was ruled out during the lab. My GI office never called me back so I'm not sure if I will ever get an answer. My Allergy doctor told me he is going to treat me as if I have EOE and would like me to also eliminate wheat from my diet. He is also having me tested to see if I'm allergic to wheat. \n\nI really hate the difficulty swallowing it seriously ruins my quality of life. When it flares up I'm completely miserable and my wife says she can just see the misery in my face. For those of you that have EOE do these symptoms sound like they are what you experienced?

I'm booked for one more dilation (15mm to 18 mm), but I'm confused as to why I didn't experience any relief after my first dilation (12 mm to 15 mm).

I initially dismissed it as a sunburn since I was outside for a prolonged period in the sun, but as time went on I noticed that it wasn\u2019t going away. So I went to get it checked out and I was told that it wasn\u2019t a sunburn but something else. They couldn\u2019t figure out what it was though because in order for it to appear, I have to continuously walk so that I can put pressure on my legs and feet and only then will it become apparent. Anyways, I didn\u2019t think much of it and just decided to ignore it since it wasn\u2019t really affecting me. But now, mid March, as I looked at my red tainted skin, it dawned on me that it could be related to my EoE. I remember reading a comment from a very knowledgeable user (sorry I can\u2019t remember his name) that the likelihood of having a comorbidity if you\u2019ve been diagnosed with EoE is very high, so I think this might be it.

All I know is when I drink soda (high fructose corn syrup) and eat popcorn (made with Canola oil), my throat feels even more sore.  Which will really suck because corn is in EVERYTHING.  Same with peanuts  (I have a known skin-prick peanut reaction, if that is reliable at all).\n\nCurrently my Fooducate app tells me to eat 2510 calories/day to get up to 165 lbs within a few months.  That is fairly hard even with only limiting gluten and dairy.  I feel like I have to eat all day long.  Many of my calories are coming from bowls of (gluten free) breakfast cereals (with coconut, almond, or oat milk).  And about 120 calories/day from Earth Chimp protein shakes (plant based).  And a few sodas (ginger ale).  Hard to get 2500+ calories when everything you eat only has 100 calories or less!\n\nI know this isn't rocket science.  Just don't eat the 6 triggers.

For about as long as I can remember, I would occasionally feel like a bite of food was stuck in my throat, like a big blob, but it would always pass in 10-20 seconds. Not every meal, nor every day, just occasionally, and I thought it was just occasional choking.\n\nBut this past Monday, the first bite of thanksgiving meal (Canadian here), that feeling happened again, and this time, it would not go away. I could breath, but I couldn't  swallow, it was like anything I tried to swallow, a sip of water or even my own saliva, was going down my windpipe instead, and I immediately coughed it back up. Thanksgiving dinner ruined, I went off to the emergency room. :-(  \nThey first treated it as a possible allergy, with epinepherine and steroids. No luck, and it was late at night, so I was admitted for observation and to see the gastroenterologist in the morning. The whole time I kept spitting into a bowl because I would drown on my own spit, and the lump feeling never went away. Needless to say, pretty much a sleepless night.  \nIn the morning, the gastroenterologist came in, and was wonderfully reassuring. He said I was a textbook case of EoE (including previous allergies, asthma, etc), he sees this frequently, and that some food was likely lodged and would come out with an endoscopy; 5 minutes, in and out, and most people go for a nice dinner after.  \nUnfortunately, that afternoon when I went into the operating room, they discovered during the endoscopy that my case was the \"worst they'd seen all year at least\", and the impacted food was not going to go down, so it had to come up instead. In doing so, I seized/retched, and they punctured my esophagus. The air they were pumping into my esophagus to keep it open subsequently went into my chest cavity, and my family told me I was in there for an hour instead of five minutes. I was rolled back into recovery writhing in pain, still unconscious, while they explained to my parents and girlfriend were told what had happened.\n\nAt whatever point my brain actually clicked \"on\" from the anesthesia, I was already screaming. Every breath was agony, screaming pain in my chest, and I was doing my absolute best to stay in control but I was screaming for help. A team of doctors were swarming me, and my mother told me later it was clear that they were trying to determine if this episode was from the esophageal puncture, or my heart, as my readings had gone through the roof.\n\nSo they dosed me with fentanyl (holy shit?), and rushed me off for a CT scan. I begged for more drugs, I couldn't cooperate with the pain, just writhe, but a second dose let me gain some semblance of control. They handed me a barium drink, and moment  of truth: I could swallow again. A small victory in all that pain.  \nThe CT scan showed no barium escaping my esophagus into chest or windpipe. It was a rough night, but morphine was enough to let me sleep a couple hours with each dose. The next day, moving caused discomfort but I could manage without the meds, and by the end of the day was discharged.  \nMostly sharing my story because my episodes seemed a bit more acute episodes, rather than persistent symptoms, and that might be helpful for some. Because of my complications I won't get to see solid food for a couple weeks, but I'll be seeing the specialist next week to start discussing the treatment of EoE for me (I'm already on antibiotics for the puncture, and special antacids as the first attempt to lessen the EoE).  \nI'm rather grateful for my healthcare system (go Canada!), and that I have great support from my family, and my girlfriend who moved in with me only a couple of weeks ago.

It\u2019s my first time researching into EoE so please bear with me and my lack of significant knowledge in the subject. My boyfriend has what we are suspecting now is EoE, although he\u2019s never been officially diagnosed.\n\nToday he was eating some thai basil chicken and choked very badly. Couldn\u2019t breath and ran to the sink. I ended up giving him the heimlich to remove the blockage. He says this blockage issue happens semi-regularly. Most times (he said 19 out of 20 times today as his estimation) he says he can drink water and the blockage will go right down, but every six months or so, that doesn\u2019t do the trick and he goes into a bad fit where his throat constricts and he can barely breath. It typically happens when he eats meat like chicken or steak. Sometimes he will even have a white froth of saliva form in his mouth after the issue which can last for a couple hours although this doesn\u2019t happen every time.\n\nIt was super scary for me and I didn\u2019t know where else to turn besides a doctor (which we hope to go see soon). Was wondering if these symptoms are what you all struggle with, or if maybe he has something different going on.\n\nCan those of you with EoE let me know if this type of stuff has ever happened to you?

Anyway, even after those external issues resolved, the trouble swallowing persisted - even when I wasn't eating I had a consistent lump/tightness in my throat almost like someone was choking me or pressing tightly just below my Adam's apple. Unsurprisingly, this caused me more anxiety and just made things worse.\n\nAfter doing some research and talking to my family doctor, she suggested it was probably LPR (since the symptoms were almost always in my throat). I tried 40mg omeprazole for about a month but didn't notice much difference so I was referred to the GI who suspected it might be EoE. I then started reading up about EoE more and felt that the symptoms matched what I was experiencing pretty consistent (trouble swallowing and choking feeling). I also have always had food/pollen allergies since I was young so it made sense.\n\nUnfortunately, the endoscopy showed a count of 10 eosinophils per HPF in one biopsy site (distal) and apparently the biopsy in my upper esophagus was fine so my GI isn't convinced that I really do have EoE and maybe it's just GERD (there was no visual damage or abnormalities in the endoscopy otherwise). Nonetheless, she wanted me to try 80mg omeprazole per day which I'm kind of anxious about starting. \n\nSo, my question is, is it possible I still have EoE? Could it be something else? I had tried cutting out dairy/soy about 1.5 weeks before and was actually staring to feel slightly better so I'm wondering if that affected the endoscopy results? Is it worth trying the 80mg omeprazole if 40 didn't really work? Should I just try to eliminate trigger foods?

I finally went to the doctor about it, they prescribed a PPI and about eight weeks after that I was in no better condition. So they did an endoscopy and biopsy. My esophagus was narrow and had rings, I had slight gastritis, and a duodenum ulcer (Though oddly, I've never experienced heart burn or stomach pains). Anyway, the doctor said it appeared to be EoE, however the biopsy turned out to be negative.\n\nI later did a huge overhaul on my diet, excluding all dairy, eggs, fish, nuts, wheat, soy, legumes, oats, cocoa, citrus fruit, and coffee.\n\nI did this for a few months and I felt a little better, but I still had issues, so I went in for another endoscopy. While my esophagitis was completely healed, my esophagus was still narrow. They dilated it and it has been nine months since. I slowly put a few foods back in here and there and the only two things I haven't included back in my diet are oats and pea protein. \n\nIt has been roughly six months since I've included everything else and I've been completely fine with no issues eating. So as you could imagine I'm scared to include either of the remaining two things back in as I assume one of them was the culprit.\n\nBut my only thought is, if it was really one of those two things, shouldn't the biopsy turned up positive? My old diet consisted of daily doses of about six cups of oatmeal (twelve servings) and five servings of pea protein, so I was eating a large amount of both every day.\n\nAlso, I had been eating oats everyday for like six years before I had any dysphagia. I had also been eating large amounts of pea protein everyday for about four years before any dysphagia. \n\nBasically:\n\n1) Is it possible to have a negative EoE biopsy despite eating large amounts of the culprit everyday leading up to the date of said biopsy?\n\n2) Is it possible to randomly develop EoE towards a specific food despite years of eating it daily with no problems?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 876, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Negative biopsy and other mysteries?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567365528, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/cxzjus/negative_biopsy_and_other_mysteries/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "peakbagger99", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9dutbryg", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1635467352, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/qi0hts/apparently_not_eoe_but_gerd/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qi0hts", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/qi0hts/apparently_not_eoe_but_gerd/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1635467363, "score": 1, "selftext": "I got my biopsy results back: \"There are some allergic cells (eosinophils) seen in the biopsies but not to a degree that would suggest a condition called eosinophilic esophagitis.

I remember how scary it was when my doctor first instructed me to go on the elimination diet, so I wrote the guide I wish I had when I was going through things for the first time.  This encompasses a ton of stuff I learned through trial and error.  It also includes some of the aspects of the diet that I've never seen written about, e.g., how to explain the diet to others.  As a disclaimer, I'm a biology PhD and have been keeping up with the recent EoE scientific literature, but this guide isn't about the science of EoE: it is about the practical aspects of living with the elimination diet.\n\n**Basic demographics**\n\nI am a late 20s man, living alone, with a flexible work from home schedule.  On the diet, I avoided:\n\n* The standard six: seafood, nuts (including coconut), soy, wheat (but not gluten), dairy, eggs\n* Legumes: beans, lentils, peas, peanuts, etc., but not guar gum or arabic gum (because eliminating those would be herculean)\n\nHalfway through, I further eliminated all gluten.  I tried to cut down on acidic foods as well, but didn't avoid them completely.  Note that my only protein source was meat, so this guide is very meat-heavy.\n\n**The initial shock**\n\nI went into my doctor's appointment thinking it would be a fairly routine appointment.  This was mid-pandemic so it was a phone appointment.  After the doctor dropped the bomb, it took me a couple days to fully comprehend what had happened at that appointment.  Had the doctor really just told me I needed to stop eating pretty much all food?  I let myself go through the Kubler-Ross stages of grief, and started to do my research on EoE.  I went to the nearby \"all natural vegan\" supermarket and spent an hour or two exploring.  I bought a ton of interesting-looking foods to try to get myself at least a bit excited.  (Though, as a disclaimer, I did start crying in the aisle.)  I did a ritual of saying goodbye to all my favorite foods, went out for an extravagant \"last supper\" with some friends, and then started the diet the next morning.\n\n**Keeping track of your diet**\n\nI bought a notebook and kept it in my kitchen.  In it, I wrote down:\n\n* The contents of each meal, and the time I ate it\n* The time I took each dose of my PPI\n* Any life events which I thought might correlate with symptoms (major stresses, lifestyle changes, changes in medication, changing physical location, etc.)\n* My swallowing symptoms (see below)\n\nIn general, it can be difficult to track swallowing symptoms because some foods are just generally easier to swallow than others.  However, I wanted to be able to compare symptoms across days.  To do this, I had the same breakfast each day: rice cereal with oat milk.  I found that if I took big bites and ate quickly, it could trigger my swallowing difficulties.  I used this as a \"benchmark\" of my symptoms each day, rating my swallowing difficulty on a scale from 1 to 5: 5 was \"food got stuck\" and 1 was \"I didn't even feel it go down\".  You might have to recalibrate your scale after a few months.\n\nAlso note that the times that are most difficult to track tend to be the most important to track, because this is when you will have new experiences or different foods than normal.  When you break your \"routine\", you gain information.  For instance, make sure to maintain your tracking when you travel.\n\nIt can be helpful to try briefly eliminating other foods if your symptoms don't go away.  For instance, throughout the diet, I tried eliminating nightshades, aubergine, celery, sesame, chicken, beef, turkey, pork, rice, alcohol, yeast, and potatoes.  I also tried switching brands of toothpaste.\n\nAlso, it can be useful to watch natural fluctuations in your symptoms.  Sometimes, an increase in symptoms isn't tied to the particular food you ate within the last few days, it can be something random you're not monitoring.  Get a baseline of increases and decreases before you blame responsibility on a food.  For instance, there is huge fluctuation in the seasons, with worst symptoms in spring/summer and best in the winter.  Many people have reported changes in symptoms related to traveling as well, or when moving houses (due to mold?).  My symptoms improved when I spent a few days in the desert, but didn't seem to respond to the elimination diet.\n\nI wish I had spent a week keeping this food log with symptoms before I started the diet.\n\n**Helpful survival tips**\n\nOne thing that helped me greatly was a commitment I made to myself: I will not worry about the price of food anymore.  You food bill will double or triple.  Rather than stress about this, accept it and embrace it.  (You will not be eating out anymore, so perhaps this offsets the cost a bit.)\n\nDon't go for substitutes.  For example, fake cheese and yogurt is not worth it.  For me, gluten free bread didn't cut it either.  Instead, focus on making delicious food with the things you can eat.  If you try to substitute everything, you'll constantly be thinking about the things you can't eat instead of the delicious things you can.\n\nSplurge on foods you would not normally buy.  Buy more expensive or interesting fruits and vegetables.  Buy expensive steak, lamb, and fresh chicken or turkey.  Try some exotic spices.  In the past I would eat steak once a year at most, but on the diet, I ate it every couple weeks.  I also splurged a lot on maple syrup, chocolate, and good sorbet.\n\nSimilarly, if you are normally cost-conscious, give yourself the luxury of buying \"convenient versions\" of food you normally buy.  For instance, prechopped vegetables might be twice as expensive, but you are probably spending waaaaay more time cooking than you would otherwise, so the convenience of it ends up being more stress relief than you realize.\n\nDon't feel bad if you have trouble getting rid of all the food in your pantry right away.  It took me a month or two on the diet before I was ready to give away my forbidden food.  My friends were very appreciative of getting bags of free food.\n\n**How to cook**\n\nIt is important to learn to cook well since you will be doing it every single day.  A few general cooking tips to get started:\n\n* Be generous with the salt.  You can't eat normal food, so at least make sure the food you can eat tastes incredible.\n* Olive oil is your friend.  Use a lot of it and things will taste better.\n* Always save the juice when you cook meat.  It is great for rice, a pan sauce, or a stir fry.\n* Save the bones/carcass from any meat you cook and keep it in a bag in the freezer.  Do the same for the scrap cuts/peelings of vegetables.  When either bag gets full, boil it down into a delicious broth.\n* Get a rice maker, it is 100% worth it.\n* Add flavoring to your rice!  I've found broth/juice from meat or stock cubes work well.  Some vegetables can be cut up and thrown in the rice make directly (e.g. carrots).  Others, e.g. onions, should be sauteed first.  Nice, flavorful rice can be eaten as a side dish on its own without being bland.\n* Gluten free pasta is just as tasty (if not tastier...) than normal pasta.\n* If you can eat non-wheat gluten, barley pearls are delicious and filling.\n* Ginger makes every stir fry better.\n* Gluten free bread tastes much better when toasted\n* You get tired of bland food rather quickly when you don't have much variety.  Go overboard on the seasoning.  Lots of seasoning will make food taste good.\n* Find a good \"staple seasoning\" that will make almost anything taste good when you are too lazy to be creative.  I used a garlic and herb for a while, then Goya Adobo, then some supermarket-brand \"chicken seasoning\".\n* Sweet and sour liquid seasoning is great for making ground beef/turkey/chicken taste good.\n* Make sure you have a very sharp knife, this makes a huge difference.\n* If you can afford it, an uncoated stainless steel pan is really useful for cooking meat.  Some people prefer cast iron instead, both serve the same function.\n* When you sear meat, add a very tiny bit of something sugary to it.  I like pomegranate syrup.  It makes it easier to get a nice crust.\n\nIf you can afford a sous vide machine, GO FOR IT.  It is a fun hobby and once you learn to use it properly, it will make your meat taste like it is from a Michelin Star restaurant despite little time/effort required on your part.\n\nMeal prep is great if you can do it, though many foods we can eat don't freeze well.  Don't try to save leftover steak or roast beef, it is never as good as fresh.  Roast chicken saves well in the refrigerator.  Rice can be refrigerated or frozen.\n\nIf you have trouble getting enough calories each day, cheap low-sugar breakfast cereal (rice pops, corn flakes, chex, etc.) are an easy and cost-effective way to get enough calories.\n\nIt is really helpful to make sure your dinner can also serve as lunch the next day as leftovers.\n\n**Specific substitutions for cooking**\n\nFlour: If you don't need to avoid gluten (just wheat), find a place to buy barley flour.  It is REALLY hard to find, but it behaves and tastes very similar to normal flour for cooking.  If you can find a gluten-free flour you can eat, these tend to be the next best choice, but can still be hard to work with for certain dishes.  Most alternative flours are tricky to work with, e.g., I spent months trying to find the right combination of rice flour, oat flour, etc. before discovering barley.\n\nEggs: For baking, the only substitute I found that works reliably is ground flax seeds after letting them sit in boiling water.  Xanthan gum gives a spongy texture, but don't use more than a tiny amount or it might cause bloating.  Banana and apple sauce work for sweet things, sometimes.\n\nSoy: Soy-free soy sauces aren't all that great.  I've found the best substitute for soy sauce is to just add water, salt, and MSG (e.g. Accent brand).  You can sometimes substitute balsamic vinegar, apple cider vinegar, or red wine.  Soy-free teriyaki sauce is actually pretty good.\n\nBread: Like I mentioned, I didn't really like gluten free bread.  However, corn tortillas can sometimes fill the role of bread, e.g., for garlic bread.  Corn chips, rice crackers, and rye crackers also have their place.\n\nMilk: Oat milk is by far the best here.  It tastes great on its own and works just like milk in most recipes.  They even have chocolate oat milk!  It might be tricky to find unsweetened oat milk though.  Some companies (e.g. Oatly) make oat yogurt which is not so good as yogurt, but it is a nice substitute for sour cream.  The next best option after oat milk is rice milk, but it really only works for drinking, not for cooking.\n\nChocolate: There are several brands of high-quality dark chocolate which do not use soy or dairy.  The Enjoy Life brand is great in the US, and Sainsbury's 80%/90% in the UK.\n\n**Recipe/food suggestions**\n\nIn general, I planned my meals such that each had a protein (which, for me, had to be meat), a carb source (usually a rice or potato product), and a fruit or vegetable.\n\nStaples:\n\n* Spaghetti with meat sauce\n* Roast chicken with potatoes, carrots, onions, etc.\n* Pancakes (GF flour, ground flax seeds, sugar, oil)\n* Cereal (see above)\n* Nachos\n* Stir fry\n\nOther foods:\n\n* Stuffed peppers\n* Buckwheat pancakes\n* Fajitas with corn tortillas\n* Beef stew\n* Pulled pork tacos\n* Rice bowl (w/ beef, green onions, cabbage, etc.)\n* Greek salad with chicken\n* Chicken/bacon/avocado pasta/salad\n* Certain brands of sausages (e.g. Boar's Head chicken sausage)\n* Gluten-free meatball pasta (meatballs are really easy to make from scratch)\n* BBQ chicken/pork and potatoes\n\n**How to explain it to people**\n\nI have a lot of wonderful people in my life, and the people I knew were very understanding and supportive when I was still in the \"freaking out\" stage.  Start with people you trust most.\n\nPeople will feel guilty about eating around you.  Sometimes, people will just not invite you to things if there will be food involved because they don't know what to say to you or feel bad for not being able to offer you anything to eat.  Other times, people will apologize profusely whenever the concept of food is brought up in a conversation.  I knew one person who would berate herself and put herself down whenever the concept of food came up because \"you can't eat that\".  They really do mean well.  They don't want you to feel uncomfortable.  It's just that they just have no little experience with the concept of an elimination diet, so they don't know how to approach it.  I found that casually bringing up food you can't eat, without reference to the fact that you can't eat it, helps ease this tension in their mind.  E.g., \"I love a good breakfast burrito.  Have you tried the ones from Frank's Bistro?  They're delicious!\"  If you get the \"Wait, you can't eat that?\" response, a response like \"Oh come on, that's just temporary\" usually works.\n\nFor casual acquaintances, it can be pretty emotionally draining to have to explain EoE and your diet to each of them.  Almost nobody understands how emotionally draining it is.  For casual acquaintances, I've found it is easiest to try to avoid telling people whenever possible.  I've tried a lot of different strategies here but found that making dumb excuses of why you can't eat (\"Darn, I just had lunch so I'm not hungry!\") tends to be the best route.  If that fails, \"I have to eat special foods right now for an upcoming medical test\" is a good fallback.\n\nWhen you talk to people about EoE, most people will start trying to think of foods you can eat.  The first few times you have these discussions, this can be helpful.  However, it gets old really fast.  Some people will continue to do this every time you see them.  It is okay to set boundaries by saying you don't want to brainstorm foods you can or can't eat.  If they are offended because they were trying to help, they will usually understand if you explain it as \"I don't want to spend our conversation talking about my limitations.\" or just say \"Don't worry, I have it fully under control.\" and then change the subject.\n\nLots of people will silently categorize you as \"one of those people\" who avoids gluten because doing so is trendy, or because they erroneously think it is more healthy, or because it makes them feel like a special snowflake.  Name-dropping \"my doctor\" or \"medical test\" usually helps with this.\n\nIf you have really awesome people in your life, they will try to cook for you.  Be careful though: most people don't think twice about throwing some butter in the pan, or sprinkling soy sauce on top of vegetables, or greasing with flour-based cooking spray.  You intuitively have (or will develop) a gut instinct reaction about what you can and can't eat, but other people don't think in those terms.  So even if you give someone the list of what you can't eat, it can be helpful to run through the recipe, just in case.\n\nRegardless, no matter how clear or simple your explanations, there will always be people who think you have a peanut allergy, and will happily alert you to stay far away from anything with peanuts in it.\n\n**Healthcare systems**\n\nI have experience with the US and UK healthcare systems.  In the US, I regularly interacted with four specialists (an allergist, a GI, a nutritionist, and a surgeon).  With so many doctors, I ended up with an appointment once or twice a month during this period.  They did a great job of educating me, getting all the right diagnostics done, and suggesting treatment plans.  However, the suggested treatment plans were all wildly different.  They also had strong opinions about things I should do which conflicted with the strong opinions of other doctors.  When I asked them about the conflicts from the other specialists, they said something like \"Well that is a valid opinion too, but I think X.\"  So I ended up having to choose whose advice to take.  I chose to mostly take the advice from the GI over the others.  However, for many questions, she would often tell me to ask the allergist or the nutritionist (who, when I asked at my next appointment a month later, would tell me to ask the GI).  Each appointment (with any of the doctors) usually ended with \"why don't you ask ___ at your next appointment with her\", creating a never-ending loop.  I had two endoscopies, one before the diet and one at the 6 month mark, but there was a mistake in the second one (the lab results didn't specify my eosinophil per hpf counts) so in practice I just had the first diagnostic one.\n\nIn the UK, I was unable to get an appointment with any specialists in NHS after 7 months of trying.  I was also unable to contact anyone about the status of the appointment.  Maybe someday I'll get off that waiting list?  But I more or less gave up on it.\n\nIn summary, doctors are doing their best, which is a lot better than what you or I could do on our own, but there are still several differences in recommended diagnostic and treatment plans.  However, you will encounter bureaucratic inefficiencies, and multiple specialists aren't necessarily better than one.  Also, these healthcare systems would make Kafka proud.\n\n*Final thoughts*\n\nAs a silver lining, having such a restricted diet helped me discover new foods I loved which I would have never tried otherwise - I had unknowingly slipped into a pattern of eating the same foods.  I'm also eating way more fruits and vegetables and less processed food than I was before.\n\nDO NOT SELF-DIAGNOSE EoE!  If you have trouble swallowing, there are many other possible explanations: GERD, a Schatzki ring, etc.  Some are much more serious than EoE, e.g., dementia.  See a doctor if you are able.  This diet is NOT healthy.  Do not follow a restricted diet unless you actually 100% really need to.\n\nLastly, a very important point.  Sometimes it feels like this whole thing is going nowhere.  Sometimes you'll come home tired and exhausted and the last thing you want to do is cook.  Sometimes you'll want to break down crying because you walk into the supermarket and you're starving but you can't eat anything on the shelf.  Sometimes you want to give up because your symptoms aren't going away.  Sometimes you'll have to turn down a fun invitation to dinner with friends and instead eat at home by yourself.  Sometimes you might be confused about whether you are \"mostly normal\" or whether you have a terrible disease which is controlling you life.  Sometimes you'll feel lonely and left out of a society that doesn't understand, or feel guilty for complaining when there are so many worse medical conditions you could have.  It's okay to feel these things.  All of these are valid.  I've felt all of these too at some point.  The best you can do it let yourself feel it, acknowledge it, let it wash over you, and then snap back to reality and continue on.\n\nGood luck, I'm cheering for you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2762, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The ultimate guide: what I've learned from 14 months on the elimination diet", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/qe43xy/the_ultimate_guide_what_ive_learned_from_14/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TilDeathDoUsPartt", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4e7rb81m", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1634951766, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/qdutd0/throat_pain/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qdutd0", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/qdutd0/throat_pain/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1634951778, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve already been diagnosed, but do y\u2019all have throat pain with EOE ?

I\u2019m hoping someone may be able to help answer some questions I have about their initial diagnosis and symptoms that led to going to their GI.\n\nFor background: I have no history or GERD or any food allergies so my symptoms came on very suddenly and unexpectedly. For about 2 weeks I have been experiencing throat tightness and pain that has now turned into difficulty swallowing solid foods. When I swallow, the food feels stuck in my esophagus and like it\u2019s inching down. A lot of times I need to drink water to get it down all the way, and it leads to chest pain behind my sternum. I am also having increasing burping after meals and can only eat small amounts. \nI went to urgent care when my swallowing became an issue and they prescribed me prednisone which seemed to help while prescribed, but after finishing the dose pack my symptoms have returned. Another red flag is during all of this I had some broccoli cheddar soup because it\u2019s easy to swallow and had an instant reaction that causes hives and swelling around my lips that I\u2019ve never experienced before (likely dairy?). I also went to an ENT who scoped my throat and he said everything looked normal and it was just anxiety, but I definitely don\u2019t think that\u2019s all it is. He said a GI/ Allergist would be the next step.\nAfter doing some research it seems I may have EOE, but would love to hear how other people first noticed their symptoms and if they came on suddenly or over time? What were some major symptoms? Did you have previous food allergies? Should I try an elimination diet until I can get into a GI?\n\nThanks so much for any advice.

When this occurs, there is no relief no matter what I do. This comes and goes on an irregular basis\n\n-This is the big one. It started a few days after the phlegm thing. Basically, it feels like I'm choking on my own throat. It feels like parts of my throat are touching other parts, and it can make me feel like I need to gag, and it also gets worse when I speak. This comes and goes on very regular intervals. Sometimes it goes away completely, and sometimes it comes on super strong and I have it for days. Sometimes it comes and goes throughout a single day. \n\nThese next two are minor\n\n-I also get a feeling (around where the soft gushy part of your throat is near your collar bones) that there is a lump. Sometimes I can physically feel it when I drink, and sometimes it feels like I need to gag. Again, this comes and goes.\n\n-I also get a feeling like the skin on the outside if my throat goes really tight and spastic. This doesn't bother me that much, but I figured I'd mention it. I had this feeling a few years ago for a week or two, and then it reappeared now. Not sure if it is connected.\n\nAll while this is happening I've had the odd case of itching red eyes, an itching mouth, a slight sore throat, and a hard time swallowing (could have been anxiety). None of these happen on a regular basis. Just a couple times throughout the last few months.\n\nLastly, I get acid reflux. I dont get it extreme, but I do get it. \n\nMy 4 main fears are as follows\n\n-cancer:  because it comes and goes I dont think it is cancer. However, I know nothing about esophageal cancer, so what do I know. I worry about it a lot.\n\nAnaphylaxis: Two doctors have told me it doesn't sound like an allergy, and given that this has been happening since August, I'm sure I'd already be dead. However, I know allergies can be fickle, and I'm still scared my throat is just gonna close up completely one day.\n\n-some crazy neurological thing or rare autoimmune disease (besides EE).\n\n-GERD or LPR: this worries me much less than the other ones because it is relatively treatable and won't kill me (at least for awhile lol). \n\n-and finally, EE. My symptoms don't really seem to match up with other EE people I've seen, but that's why I'm making my post. Maybe other people have felt like this. I'm really scared of EE because I don't want to feel like this forever. Like I'm choking on my own throat. Its horrible. Is EE treatable? Does it kill you? Does life go on alright with it?\n\nSorry for the long post. I've had a bad week, I'm coming off my zoloft, and I have a major essay do, so I'm not handling this well right now. I see the gastro soon for my endoscopy. They have already told me outright they think it is anxiety. I don't believe that at all, and it discourages me because it makes me feel they won't really try to get to the bottom of this.

I want to start off by saying thank you to anyone who is able to give me advice here. I am 24F who has been diagnosed with EOE since the age of 15. I initially took pantoprazole for many years and it worked fantastically. Two years ago during a routine endoscopy, my GI found that the pantoprazole was no longer working. Before the pandemic began, I started on a six food elimination diet. It was going well until the hospital is shut down and I was unable to be scoped anymore for about six months. My year long elimination diet quickly turned into two years and I was not able to stick with it. My doctor has now given me the option to go back to the six food elimination diet, or try oral steroids. \n\nMy one main question is for those of you who have been on oral steroids, what kind of side effects have you found? I have heard horror stories of people going on steroids and blowing up like a balloon and having awful side effects. I am also nervous about the long-term impact of taking steroids. \n\nMy problem is that I don\u2019t know that I have the mental commitment and time right now to go back on the six food elim diet after doing it for almost two years. I am exhausted mentally. I feel so hopeless with this disease. My doctor has told me to let him know what my decision is but I go back-and-forth constantly. I feel like the easy way out is steroids and that I am not actually getting to the root of the problem. I have also thought about doing steroids for a while until I am mentally ready and in a place in my life where I can do the six food elim diet again, but I really just don\u2019t know.

Stomach, antrum, biopsy:\nGastric antral mucosa with minimal chronic inflammation.\nNo Helicobacter pylori organisms identified on routine stain.\nB.

But since being on the PPI, I\u2019ve not had any issues swallowing issues, or at least no impactions or trouble swallowing in the slightest. Sometimes I think I'm noticing my swallowing but I think it's just anxiety, there's really no objection swallowing problems now and I've even subconsciously started eating faster again since I was really careful for awhile.

Since I couldn\u2019t get a referral from my GP I decided to contact a GI myself who did an endoscopy and found typical signs of EoE. The count he said was borderline but the signs were pretty clear on the pictures of my esophagus. GI said the burping was supragastric belching that I subconsciously developed as a response to EoE (which has improved somewhat since I was told this). I\u2019m being put on budesonide for 3 months followed by repeat endoscopy. \n\nI have a few questions - since I\u2019ve only experienced dysphasia twice (not had it for 6 weeks) and the eosinophil count was borderline is it possible I only have a mild form of EoE? Is the budesonide treatment necessary (I\u2019d prefer not to take steroids). Also my GI said EoE is chronic, do you have to take budesonide for the rest of your life?\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2651, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New EoE diagnosis questions", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ptboml/new_eoe_diagnosis_questions/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Scottishking85", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13xrz5", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1632320747, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/pt8n61/vitamins/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pt8n61", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/pt8n61/vitamins/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1632320758, "score": 1, "selftext": "Can anyone suggest a good multivitamin?

I posted recently about food allergies, but learned that trigger foods and allergies aren't the same.\n\nI'm making a list of same, suspected, and unsure foods to get a plan for my elimination diet. But I was wondering if things are triggers in all forms, or if they can be triggers in just one. For example if someones trigger is chicken, should chicken stock/broth be reintroduced separately?

\n\nbelow is a quick summary of the report:\n\nbiopsy specimens:\n\n* a. esophagus, distal\n   * 2 tan pink irregularly shaped soft tissue fragments\n   * no eosinophils identified\n* b. esophagus, mid\n   * 2 tan pink irregularly shaped soft tissue fragments\n   * no eosinophils identified\n\nother findings:\n\n* normal duodenum\n* normal stomach\n* diffuse mild mucosal changes characterized by erythema were found in the lower third of the esophagus\n* mucosal changes including congestion (edema) and crepe paper esophagus were found in the middle third of the esophagus and in the lower third of the esophagus. biopsies were obtained from the proximal and distal esophagus for histology of suspected eosinophilic esophagitis *\\[note: i looked up crepe paper esophagus and basically everything that comes up has to do with EoE, so that's definitely suspicious\\]*\n* no endoscopic abnormality was evident in the esophagus to explain the patient's complaint of dysphagia\n\ni've heard that to accurately diagnose EoE you need at least 5 samples from each biopsy site, but if i'm reading this correctly, it looks like my doctor only took 2 samples from each site? it also doesn't look like they took any biopsies in the upper part of the esophagus which is where i experience the biggest percentage of my symptoms. why would they do this? i mean if they're gonna biopsy the esophagus, wouldn't they want to biopsy all parts of the esophagus to ensure thoroughness? also side question - does EoE affect the entire length of the esophagus or can it only affect a portion? because if it's the latter then maybe that could explain the no eosinophils finding since the biopsies were taken from a part of the esophagus where i hadn't really been experiencing much symptomology as of late??? \n\nthis ties in with another consideration i had which is that i wasn't experiencing any symptoms at the time of my procedure, so could that have possibly caused a false negative? i'd already been eliminating many things from my diet at this point and had already taken out most of the top 6 allergens except for tree nuts and peanuts (so far wheat/gluten seems to be my biggest one with peanuts being a newly identified potential trigger as well). nonetheless i *did* experience mild symptoms for a couple days the week before the endoscopy, and occasional symptoms most weeks before that (ranging from mild to moderate). however, i do know that eosinophils can take a long time to clear, so if they were there they most likely would have shown up on the biopsy right? but then again, there's the question of did they take enough samples, and did they take enough samples in the right places?\n\nhaving said all of this, what do you all think? would you be convinced of the pathology findings or is EoE still suspect?

I\u2019ve been having a dumpster fire of a time since March 1. I\u2019ll try to keep this short. \n \nStarting in March I began seeing a gastroenterologist for food impaction problems. He did an endoscopy and found eosinophilic cells, and my journey begins.\n \nI begin taking pantopazole 40 mg twice a day, and an inhaler that I swallow. (Can\u2019t remember the name right now) the inhaler was a steroid, and I hade a really really bad reaction to it after 14 days exactly (shaking, panic attacks, shortness of breath) so I stopped taking that. \nMy esophagus was working great the way the normal persons does for a whole 63 days before EOE decided to remind me that no, I am not a normal person silly! \n\nSo since near the end of May I am having all sorts of problems. I have new meds, budesonide , but a liquid that sticks to my insides for a half hour, anti depressants, and something I don\u2019t even remember why I\u2019m taking it.

Have I been misdiagnosed? Could it be simply fixed? And if you have anything else to throw in there I\u2019m all ears!!! \n\nThanks so much everyone who always answers.

I originally got on these for bad heartburn, but was kept on them when I brought up the swallowing issue a few years later. I don\u2019t have much heartburn anymore, but my swallowing is worse than ever. \n\nMost of the posts I\u2019ve read regarding dysphagia and eosinophilic esophagitis talk more about a lump of food being stuck down in the throat, but mine is usually smaller pieces getting stuck at the very top. It feels like it\u2019s right around where the jaw meets the neck, or where the tonsils are. \n\nA lot of the time, I will swallow a bite and the food will get stuck there or in my back teeth and I will choke. Stringy foods like meat (especially pulled pork and steak), green beans, cheese, and worst of all: onions, are almost impossible for me to eat. I have even had issues with the skins of potatoes in mashed potatoes. Very small items or items that are more \u201csolid\u201d like rice, bread, and cereal, are no problem for me. \n\nIf something gets stuck, I try to swallow it several times and drink water and eventually it will go down. It doesn\u2019t effect my breathing or saliva swallowing at all. But I can feel something stuck to the side of my throat.\n\nI have been to the ENT and he thinks it\u2019s acid reflux related. He looked in my throat for a couple seconds, but did not do any further tests. My primary care doctor agrees with him. I have been on heartburn medication for years, and the food getting stuck just seems to get worse. \n\nI have anxiety as well, and am on a very low dose of medication for that. I think some of my difficulty swallowing is anxiety related. I am just so scared to swallow now and will chew one bite for a minute or longer because I am so scared I won\u2019t swallow right. I\u2019ve even had to spit out bites every now and then for fear I couldn\u2019t do it (only happened a few times). However, the food getting caught does happen frequently, so I don\u2019t believe it is completely anxiety related. \n\nDoes anyone else have a similar issue?

Relieved I finally have something to call it, confused about embarking on a new medical journey. Wondering what I'm allergic to, etc.\n\nAnyway, hi. Glad there's a subreddit, at least.

A year and a half ago, I developed a wheezing cough out of nowhere that never went away. I use an Albuterol inhaler as needed when I start wheezing, a few times a week. About 6 weeks ago in the middle of lunch I thought maybe something didn't agree with me or I had food poisoning. I have had nausea and intense stomach cramping since then. My doctor has me on Omeperazole, Hyoscamine for the cramping, and Zofran for the nausea which has helped some but I have this stomach pain like someone has punched me in the stomach most days almost all day. I dread eating now because I worry it will cause more pain. I know that I have it much better than some people, with less severe symptoms but at this moment I'm feeling discouraged. Partially because so little is known about the condition and because it is permanent. \n\nI'm a mama to 2 little boys and they are so active.

I was super into bodybuilding and would drink many whey protein shakes/ and eat lots of beef. One day eating at a restaurant with my girlfriend, I got meat stuck. Little did I know the problems and issues that would come with this. I wasn\u2019t able to vomit, or get any water down. Honestly it was one of the scariest moments in my life. My girlfriend drove me to the hospital, and that\u2019s where the fun began. Anyone who has gotten a scope down their esophagus knows the first 5 seconds aren\u2019t very much fun. When I woke up, I was told they needed to run tests to figure out what was going on. Low and behold I had EOE. From this point on, I was on track to figure out how to prevent this situation. My father is a doctor and never saw this issue in adult men (I was 19 at the time) it was mostly in children. He helped me research what I could do to prevent this from Happening again. I have been on Omeprazole and the inhaler. The inhaler never seemed to do much for me so I stopped using it. I had multiple allergy tests done on multiple occasions and am not allergic to anything. This was frustrating and led me to the elimination diet. Also a bust, some foods would give me reactions on some days when other days I was fine. One thing that has worked quite well is on flare ups my doctor has prescribed prednisone. I keep about 3 tablets of 10mg on hand I take if I start to feel issues flaring you. Also tums are my best friend and really help control my acid reflux. Anyway I just wanted to let you all know that I feel your pain, and my life hasn\u2019t been the same since that day. I\u2019m going to make a list of foods that always seem to bug me. \n\nWhey protein \nAnything with red sauce \nPizza \nChocolate \nFizzy drinks\nSome yogurts \nDiet soda \nEnergy drinks \nCoffee sometimes? Mostly acid reflux minimally \nMeat \nSandwiches sometimes \nAlcohol besides vodka/ gluten free ace cider (doesn\u2019t bug me very much if at all.) \nAngry orchard has made me vomit the two times I\u2019ve tried it, from one cider. Not sure what\u2019s in that but my esophagus disagrees lol. \n\nI eat pretty bad, and just recently had a really bad flare up which is actually how I found this thread. I\u2019m devoted to making a change so my life and wife (who was my girlfriend then can be enjoyable) \n\nAlso a side note, I\u2019m not sure if this is everyone but when my EOE  flares up  my breathe is gnarly.

Took me over an hour and 2 cups of water to eat a gluten free bison burger.

Started as bloating and loose, hard to pass stool which slowly got worse over time and also led to acid reflux and skin issues. I am not sure whether the skin problem is dermatographia or eczema; periodically the skin will get super itchy, mainly on the hands or arms, and if I scratch it will itch even more and turn red, sometimes cause minor hives. I think this is definitely GI related as the itching happens within 30 minutes to a few hours or eating something, and has also flared up a few times whenever I have an upset stomach with acid reflux. So far I don't think it's a specific food causing it as the skin reaction as it is not always consistent after eating. \n\nI have looked into MCAS (mast Cell Activation Syndrome) and I don't think that is the cause, as the symptoms didn't have any change with H1 and H2 antihistamines, or a quercetin supplement. I also don't have noticable reactions to exercise, stress, chemicals, etc. like many people with this condition do.\n\nBased on the fact that I had bloating first followed by reflux I'm pretty sure the initial problem is SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth)/leaky gut syndrome. The symptoms here are relatively mild; bloating and reflux is helped by eating smaller portions and chewing up the food more. Reflux feeling has gotten better over time, in the start when I first had it and suspected EoE I could barely sleep at night due to upset stomach and reflux. The only reason I even suspected EoE was because I read that the symptoms are very similar to normal acid reflux, and I figured I would have a higher risk of it as I have a longstanding history of IgE food allergies and asthma. I don't and have never had a food impaction or the tendency to eat very slowly (hell I can eat and swallow really fast still, pretty sure that years of doing that may have played a role in my gut problems). The only thing I notice that may point to EoE is the feeling of food particles stuck in the throat sometimes after meals, but this is relatively minor. I got an endoscopy and they didn't find strictures or anything in the esophagus, only notable thing in the biopsies was a very high count of eosinophils (over 40/hpf) in the distal esophagus. I know that GERD inflammation can also cause eosinophils to accumulate in the GI tract but this is a pretty high number from that alone. I haven't taken any PPIs as I know that medications that slower stomach acid can make SIBO worse. Doctor prescribed swallowed flovent to ease the inflammation in the esophagus, have not started this yet either. So far I have not been able to narrow down any specific trigger foods for EoE either, I think the reflux symptoms are just due to upset stomach and overeating/eating too fast. \n\nSo...is it possible for esophageal eosniophilia to cause such skin problems? Could they be alleviated by doing EoE therapy meds? Based on what I have read about EoE, the symptoms are only localized to the esophagus and GI tract. If it's related at all from blood tests I have consistently had an abnormally high level of eosinophils in the blood, but I think that is just a more sensitive immune system due to food allergies.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1285, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can EoE cause skin problems?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/gidlxt/can_eoe_cause_skin_problems/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Jwarrior77", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_44o7i1qj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1589075649, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ggsl1g/ketotifen/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ggsl1g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/ggsl1g/ketotifen/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1589075651, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I know this med is for people whose struggle with Mast Cell disorders.

I successfully used digestive enzymes to help clear my esophagus.   \n\nHi Guys,  \n\nSo, I got food stuck in my esophagus again last night.

It was going nowhere.   \n\nSo I thought I'd try and dissolve it using some digestive enzymes; try to recreate the stomach juices in my esophagus. A bit of googling revealed a paper on this approach which claims it works well.   \n\nSo, every few hours I mixed a capsule of enzymes with a small amount of coke, forced it down and let it sit there. Sure enough, this morning, the meat that was stuck was much softer and I was able to use the other techniques to clear my esophagus.  \n\nIt's still painful obviously, but didn't require a trip to the hospital.

If anything I say is incorrect, please correct me, and provide any other information you have! Also, if you're feeling anxious and don't want more information on the pandemic, please don't read! I don't want to make anyone panic, I'm mostly just curious.\n\nI've seen a lot of contradicting information, but it looks like for those of us who take steroids, there's a chance we may be at higher risk for more serious effects of COVID-19. Autoimmune diseases on their own do not cause a compromised immune system, however, taking steroids orally can. Flovent, for example, works like any other steroid by reducing inflammation and immune activity in the area. There isn't very much information for people who swallow steroid inhalers, so a lot of the information I found was for people who take it for asthma. The asthma websites seem relatively unconcerned, but my question is about how it would be different with swallowing? I know that the regular dose for people with asthma is 110, 2 puffs daily, but since I have EoE, I'm on twice that, maybe 4 times (I'm at 220, 2 puffs twice daily, but I'm not sure if people usually take it once or twice a day).\n\nI know that if you take steroids as a pill they'll cause a lot more immunosuppression than inhaling, but what about us? What about swallowing something that's meant to be inhaled? Can it be absorbed into our stomach, or does all of it stay in the esophagus? Also, does that dosage difference matter? \n\nIn addition, there's all sorts of overlapping disorders that a lot of us have- Asthma, EDS, gastroparesis, chron's, celiac, etc. So how do those play in? What about the medications for those? \n\nObviously I have a lot of questions, and the fact of the matter is that there isn't very much research on the subject yet, but we should all be careful regardless. If there's a doctor here that has advice or information, I'd appreciate it very much.\n\nStay home and stay safe!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1225, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Covid-19 and autoimmune issues", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/fwcvka/covid19_and_autoimmune_issues/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "reignthepain", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1mbg0ta8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1586136383, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/fvpkwg/can_someone_please_message_me_that_has_done_the_6/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fvpkwg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/fvpkwg/can_someone_please_message_me_that_has_done_the_6/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1586138841, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1224, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can someone please message me that has done the 6 food elimination diet.

At this point I am also having skin issues such and what seems like random reactions to food and other things which makes me suspect a mast cell/histamine issue. I got an endoscopy done recently, came back negative for celiac and H. pylori but showed a count of over 40 eosinophils per hpf. in the distal esophagus (proximal esophagus and everywhere else was normal). Visually there was no damage except for \"evidence of mild reflux\". Based on that I'm pretty the increased count is due to EoE alone and not the GERD symptoms. I still experience a lot of belching, especially after meals and a frequent feeling of tightness at the top of my throat which is usually relieved by sucking in a lot of air until I have a \"bubble\" like feeling (weird way to describe it but I don't know the word) in my esophagus. Occasionally have trouble swallowing which comes and goes (it's limited to just feeling of particles food stuck in throat, never had what feels like a food impaction or legit choking), does not seem to be triggered by a specific food. \n\nBasically, I am confused what I should deal with first...I have some symptoms and clinical evidence of EoE, yet most of the symptoms that are bothering me (besides the throat issues) such as sensitive skin, flushing, etc. seem to be consistent with complications of SIBO. From what I have read there is little/no connection between EoE and SIBO (I assumed that all of my throat and reflux issues were caused by SIBO or whatever the stomach/intestine problem is since I didn't start feeling throat symptoms until the most recent allergy exposure) so is it just possible I have both diseases?

I've had a total of only 3 endoscopies during this time. My most recent one in August showed a narrow esophagus, but the narrowing was only noticeable in the distal/lower esophagus because the endoscope had a hard time passing through that area. According to my GI doctor, my esophagus is about 8-10 mm wide in the lower portion of my esophagus which is half the size of a normal esophagus. The tissue of my esophagus is otherwise healthy because I took a course of prevacid right before the endoscopy. My doctor now wants me to stay on prevacid for a lifetime to prevent my esophagus from getting more narrow while I get it dilated periodically. Aside from gluten, brown/green lentils, butternut squash and some forms of dairy, I have a hard time distinguishing between GERD symptoms and EoE symptoms since both are contributing to the formation of scar tissue in my esophagus. This makes it very difficult to tell which foods are my triggers and what exactly I should avoid. Doing an elimination diet while also trying to avoid acidic or high fat foods that contribute to acid reflux would be overwhelming and leave me with a very limited amount of foods to eat. As a result, my doctor wants me on ppi's for a lifetime. I don't like the idea of this because of the long term side effects of ppi's and the ones I had already experienced in the past. I'm also terrified of what would happen if I didn't take ppi's. I would hate to end up with severe or extreme narrowing to the point that I can't eat anything. And aside from esophageal cancer, surgical removal of the esophagus is also my biggest nightmare.

Long time looker, first time poster. I'm not seeking any medical advice but curious if people recognize similar symptoms and have any thoughts. Sorry for the long-ish post...\n\nI've been having increasingly bad nights of food blockage over the past few years and needing to swallow hard to get it moved to my stomach. It uncomfortably and sometimes painfully make its way down my esophagus and then what feels like my entire digestive system. Only when it's done can I sleep. Sometimes 3-6 hours after I go to bed which really sucks.\n\nI also have a theory about some pockets in the back of my throat (on the left generally) that catch bits of food, sometimes for days or weeks. This aggravates the issue naturally and has even resulted in low-level infections, something I've correlated to when my left ear starts to look red.\n\nFound some ways to turn my head and swallow/cough to where it gets dislodged ...or I think it is because I definitely FEEL something move to the center of my throat where it continues the slow journey down with more work on my part.\n\nI've never done a food elimination diet because I'm too damn lazy about it and can usually live through the symptoms. But I have deduced that it can sometimes feel directly linked to bread. I try to avoid it. But I haven't ruled out dairy either. I mostly drink oat milk or soy for anything. But still eat eggs and cheese.\n\nSome enticing bits of information:\n\nA) Initially, my doc said I had a small esophagus to begin with. He stretched it out on my first endo... and \n\nB) My last endo in 2017 revealed 0 eosinophils so both my doctors think I could be in the small bracket that ppi therapy works for.\n\nC) I've been taking Citrucel to aid in general health. I'm 45.\n\nD) It's allergy season again. I have seasonal allergies and eczema as well that can flare up with alcohol and stress. I've recently taken a hiatus from coffee and alcohol last week to deal with the stress of the world melting down... \n\nAnyhoo, does anyone else have similar issues? My hunch is my throat is thrashed from all these years of 'getting by' and maybe i have no lining anymore whatsoever.

The test results showed that my counts went up slightly for the initial test. I was very strict with the diet making sure there was little to no contamination.\n\nNow my doctor is giving me the choice of going on the 6 Food Elimination (adding nuts and seafood) or taking budesonide. I honestly don't know which would be better, especially with COVID-19 causing places to close or run out of supplies.\n\nFor the food elimination, the 4 food was already fairly tough. It was hard to do social activities (since most are based around food or travel) and I don't trust others to be as thorough when checking ingredients (my own mother made a mistake when visiting with a food that could have traces of soy). But if I have to work from home due to closers the diet could be easier, with not being around other people eating foods I can't.\n\nFor the medication, it could be costly. Especially if it is manufactured outside of the country if shipping restrictions go into effect or supply/ production is low. I have also not been able to talk to my doctor yet about side effects or risk. But I wouldn't have to worry about food restrictions.\n\nI know people's experiences can be different, but I would like to see opinions of people who have been through it before.\n\nAlso, any advice on where to shop for allowed foods that don't break the bank would be great. I live in the Midwest so chain stores like Aldi or Kroger, etc. owned would be great.\n\nTLDR: Trying to decide if I should go on the 6 Food Elimination diet or budesonide options given by my doctor.

I am so happy to find it and read the many  posts. Here's my experience. It might be a bit long. Always keen to learn more and happy share my  experience in case it might help someone.\n\nSix years ago I started experiencing impacted food in 2015 about five  years after moving into my current house. I did not understand what it  was. I always ran to a sink and stuck my fingers down my throat until  the impacted food came up. That worked fine for  a while but then it got serious. I ended up in ER, on an operating  table, with a surgeon using an endoscope to push down impacted food to  clear the blockage. Endoscope pics and biopsies confirmed EOE very  clearly.\n\nI declined the prescriptions. I did not want to take steroids. In my  mind they treated symptoms but not the cause. I am a bit stubborn like  that. An allergy test showed me to not be allergic to any of 18 common  things. Hmm. What to do? So I thought it might be environmental. I  experimented  a lot with food. I wondered about fertilizers and insecticides.  Glyphosate is used a lot in farming here. So I ate organic whenever  possible. I went all in. I found a cooked vegetable diet was soft, easy  to swallow and had little risk of impacted food, especially  as I started to eat slower, chew better, and always drink while eating.  I became a huge fan of forksoverknives.com and felt a number of general  health benefits. \n\nI found a number of foods triggering bad headaches on some days but not  others. Especially grains. But I wasn't allergic to them. I thought it  might be the water which pasta and grains absorb as they cook. We got it  tested. Lead and fluorine were quite high. Two years ago we started  buying bottled mineral water. Immediate improvement. Drinking, washing  food and cooking takes a lot of water. We got a water filter installed  last month. A reverse osmosis filter with 100% removal of lead,  fluorine, e-coli and more. This is week  four with the filter. I love it! Anxiety over food content has reduced  dramatically. Everything tastes better. Leaky gut information helped me  deal with the headaches. I found Kefir worked great for me. I loved  kimchi but it smelled the house out. Kombucha  so so. I don't care for sauerkraut.\n\nThe other cause I wonder about is amalgam dental fillings. Amalgam  contains mercury. Amalgam was widely used when I was a kid and our local  dentist filled our mouths with them. I've replaced old fillings where  possible. But I still have a few big  molar amalgam fillings. I am considering replacing them with implants.\n\nI still have EOE. Managed not cured. Diet and water changes help me live  with it. I still get some impacted food, dry bread and toast are the  usual causes so I try to drink a lot of filtered water with food. I  think environmental factors are the cause, definitely  water content, possibly dental fillings, possibly fertilizers and  insecticides. \n\nI very interested to hear of any links between EOE and fluorine, glyphosate, amalgam and other chemicals in our environment.\n\nMany thanks again for this subreddit!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1171, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "EOE but allergy tests all negative", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/febqa7/eoe_but_allergy_tests_all_negative/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MayoSlug", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_33e1ji1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1583391717, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/fdrimc/vomiting_stuck_food/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fdrimc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/fdrimc/vomiting_stuck_food/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1583391719, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey y'all! I just found this sub and I'm so glad because I feel like many answers to my prayers just got answered. Didn't know how serious this was, I'm gonna try to get checked out some time soon.\n\nLast time I had a problem it hurt SO bad I pretty much failed at breathing and went on panic mode.. All because I ate a slice of fucking pizza without drinking water/soda with it.\nWith that said, I have a question:\n\nIt happens every time food gets stuck when I don't drink enough water with my food-\n\nIf my chest begins to hurt after a meal, I see my life flash before my eyes. I've never done it before, but I see you guys talk about vomiting a lot and saying that it helps.. (That last sentence sounds kinda disturbing without context, Jesus.) But I'm confused..? Am I supposed to make myself vomit to avoid potential chest pain and non stop salivating RIGHT when I know it's coming? Does vomiting stop the pain completely or just makes it easier to bare and quicker? I never needed to vomit in this situation, I thought vomiting was only for those that absolutely had to because the pain was unbearable but apparently they also do it on purpose.. but I'm going to be honest, the thought of putting more pressure to my chest feels fucking awful and scary but that's why I'm asking just in case.\n\nI realized some of you can drink soda to make the pain easier but in my case, I can't even drink my own saliva. I'm thinking maybe puking is also only for certain people, I know for a fact I can't swallow anything BUT I can in fact! spit endless amount of saliva and do nothing else but wait.. that's just been my way of dealing with it these past years.

I thought I would share my story and see if anyone has experienced anything similar to me. \n\nOver the last year or so, I started having problems with swallowing. At first it was isolated incidents \u2014 one every couple of months \u2014 where I choked on food and had to spit it up or wait for it to swallow. Despite how terrifying these incidents were, it took a while to have the issue addressed because of COVID. \n\nI have since been extremely careful with my chewing and have had no choking incidents since September. However, a new symptom emerged over the last few months. A feeling like something is in my throat. I can feel it pretty acutely after drinking a cup of coffee in the morning. It\u2019s almost like I can feel the inflammation. Sometimes I can also feel food struggle to go down my throat. Even a cold glass of water can give me difficulties \u2014 like the throat seizes up. The sensation comes and goes. \n\nI have no real history of food allergies, except I recall when I was young occasionally getting a tingling sensation in my mouth and ears when eating certain fruits (e.g. canteloupe) and on one occasion \u2014 a long time ago \u2014 a chocolate-covered macadamia nut caused me to throw up. I thought I might have allergies but my parents didn\u2019t take me seriously \u2014 it\u2019s funny how you remember these things years later!\n\nThere\u2019s a few other odds and ends to note. First, I\u2019ve been struggling a bit with chest tightness when exercising (hiking inclines) over the last couple of years. I now wonder if that was a symptom (ECG was unremarkable). That said, I only get mild reflux symptoms once in a blue moon (such as after drinking white wine). Does EoE affect anyone\u2019s exercise? Second, also a couple years ago I started noticing GI changes \u2014 generally softer stools that haven\u2019t really abated. I find it a odd coincidence that this change coincided with the EoE. Did anyone else experience this? \n\nMy endoscopy was last month and EoE was confirmed. My GI doctor started me on Esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I haven\u2019t noticed any changes yet. An allergist started me on the 6-food elimination diet. I\u2019m on day 3 of that. Still no changes. \n\nI have read a lot of threads here and I empathize with everyone \u2014 many of you have had a far more difficult time than me.

The allergist suggested seeing a gastro, who then sent her for an endoscopy. The endoscopy and biopsies confirmed EOE and also found a ulcer, which the Dr said was unrelated.

She then explained that treatment is either PPI/Prilosec (Omeprazole) or steroids. She said we should start with the Prilosec, 40mg a day, especially since she needs this for the ulcer anyway, and we've been doing that for a few weeks now. She also recommended supplementing with Calcium due to the Prilosec possibly causing calcium deficiency. Is prilosec/Omeprazole  the best approach or do steroids work better typically?

Also having a narrowed esophagus means certain foods are more likely to get stuck than others, but this is mainly due to the texture of the food and not the chemical makeup of the food. \n\nI am only posting this because there seems to be a lot of confusion about what EoE is and I just want people to stay informed.

But then I started feeling the more common EoE symptoms (lump in throat, regurgitation, mucous, trouble swallowing, raspy voice, but no choking). I now realize that the breathing, chest tightness are likely caused by the inflammation in my lower esophagus. I went back to my dr. and she thought this was now caused by the new inhaler, or.....my \"anxiety\" of course. Drs love to say it's anxiety if they don't know what it is. I refused to accept that answer and went to an ENT. My ENT said maybe GERD, go to the GI. I went to the GI and was put on panteproprazole in early August. By end of Aug I had my endoscopy where it was confirmed EoE with rings.\n\nI then got put on flovent inhaler 2 puffs 2x a day with the PPI. That was all my GI did. They told me it could be allergies or acid reflux, but didn't suggest I try an elimination diet or anything like that, and only learned about doing that from this sub. So in September I went to an allergist and the skin prick test showed nothing. I then learned that skin prick tests show IgE allergies and my eosinophils may be \"allergic\" to different things. Because of this I figured that elimination diet would be my best bet. At this time my symptoms were just as bad as when I wasn't on a PPI or the flovent.\n\nI started the elimination diet in the beginning of October, so I've been on it for 1.5 months. It can be hard to pinpoint which food is triggering you, as a reaction can take days to actually manifest and by that time you wouldn't think to blame a food from days ago. So I wanted to go super limited, as people have some reactions to pretty innocently seeming foods, like an apple or broccoli.\u200b\n\nI'm currently strictly eliminating: dairy, gluten, eggs, nuts, shellfish, soy ( the big six), and then I've additionally eliminated corn (including corn syrup), legumes, alliums (garlic, onion, etc). I'm doing this as strict as possible and I've noticed amazing amazing results. I have no symptoms currently, which is why I'm not in a rush (other than social pressures, feeling like I can't eat out, and it being monotonous) to add back in food. It probably took me 3 weeks to feel totally normal.\u200b\n\nAnyway, here's what I usually eat if you need to do the big six. the elimination of garlic and onions makes eating out really difficult, as these are found in literally every sauce (hot sauce, bbq, and really any savory food that lists \"natural flavors\" will have garlic powder).\n\nbreakfast:\n\n-GF oatmeal with coconut milk, banana, cinammon\n\n-homemade GF/vegan pancakes with maple syrup\n\n-smoothies!: coconut milk, banana, strawberry, blueberry, ice\n\n \n .\n \n\n\n\u200blunch/dinner i've relied on batch making in the instapot\n\n-coconut curry: coconut milk, chicken, potato, carrot, organic curry powder, tomato paste\n\n-beef stew: browned chuck steak, wine, water, potato, carrot, celery, salt, pepper, tomato paste\n\n-chicken thighs sauteed in curry powder over rice\n\n-potato gnocchi with homemade pesto\n\n-shredded pork over rice\n\n-steak with veggies\u200b\n\n\n .\n\n \n\neating out:\n\n-carnitas and rice from chipotle\n\n-chicken wings with no sauce - (if takeout I make a homemade sauce with coconut yogurt, hot sauce, lemon, maple syrup)\n\n-sushi rolls with coconut aminos instead of soy sauce\n\n\u200b\n\ndrinks:\n\n-wegman's light lemonade (made with stevia)\n\n-coke zero (has no corn syrup unlike regular coke)\n\n-chai concentrate with coconut milk\n\n-espresso with brown sugar\n\n-I try not to have too much alcohol but if I do it is cider or wine\n\n\u200b\n\nsnacks:\n\n-so delicious coconut milk ice cream (mint, cookie dough)\n\n-kettle cooked potato chips salt and vinegar or jalapeno (w/o natural flavors)\n\n-wegman's has an \"allergy free\" natures pantry aisle and there are many brands where there thing is that they make snacks w/o the \"big 6\" and you can find cookies, etc.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis is pretty limiting because i've eliminated more than the big six. But I've found that many people also have a problem with corn, and legumes are related to soy, so I thought it would be worth it. Even though it's so limiting, I am so happy on it because my symptoms are gone. I will likely try to start adding things back in in a few weeks and I will add them in one at a time, for a few weeks at a time to see if I've noticed symptoms.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and please share your journey!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1738, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My journey so far with EoE", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/jwlr4s/my_journey_so_far_with_eoe/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605724998, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/jwlkfq/my_new_journey_with_eoe/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jwlkfq", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/jwlkfq/my_new_journey_with_eoe/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "removed_by_category": "deleted", "retrieved_on": 1605738564, "score": 1, "selftext": "[deleted]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1738, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "My new journey with EoE", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/jwlkfq/my_new_journey_with_eoe/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LeemanIan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4a90iftt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605685353, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/jwbmoa/any_tips_for_finding_your_triggers/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jwbmoa", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/jwbmoa/any_tips_for_finding_your_triggers/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1605704040, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hey there!

My allergist requested some blood work which came back showing the only food I was allergic to was eggs (which I eat all the time with no reaction). She also told me the at I should go on a Gluten/Dairy free diet for 6-8 weeks. During the diet things started to get better and the last day of my diet was my follow up scope to check the results. The results were good showing a lower cell level in my throat and only needing a slight dilation. Since my follow up (2 weeks ago), I have returned to eating everything and at this point can only assume that was a bad idea. My symptoms have returned, and I am coughing and clearing my throat constantly, and feel as if a mucus is building up in my throat. The majority of posts I have read are about people with stomach pains and difficulty swallowing which I don\u2019t seem to have. Are there any of you out there mainly dealing with a consistent cough, chest ache and the feeling of a mucus stuck in your throat? If so, how are you dealing with it? Do you keep a detailed journal? Did you do an elimination diet and if so, do you do cheat days to enjoy a meal you miss?  Are there any resources out there that are helpful for people with EOE? Are there any other steps i can take to to relieve symptoms? In general, does EOE go into some sort of remission (I couldn't find a clear answer)?

After several days of feeling a sensation of food being stuck in my throat, I went to an ENT and was diagnosed with LPR (silent reflux) over 3 weeks ago and was promptly put on Omeprazole. I was kind of surprised at the diagnosis as I've always been a healthy eater and am thin. I chalked it up to intense stress and my (prior to diagnosis) caffeine consumption. However, I'm about 3 weeks in and still having days where my throat/esophagus feels just as bad as it did before I started any treatment. I've also been on a strict low acid diet, have been also taking Zinc Carnosine, lots of lukewarm slippery elm/marshmallow DGL licorice tea, and have been eating small meals. I'm having a hard time with textured foods. They feel uncomfortable going down so I've been eating mainly smooth or liquid foods. Struggling with getting enough calories in and feeling a weird suspicion that maybe it's not silent reflux after all as some days my throat barely bothers me and others it feels like I'm swallowing glass when I eat. I went to an allergist to ask about food allergies but she said I should go to a GI first. So now I'm scheduled for an endoscopy in about two weeks. Is there anything I should mention to the GI before the endoscopy? Do most GI doctors know about EoE?

When I drink water I can feel things wash down slowly.\n\nDoes this mean I am still having a reaction to food in my esophagus and I need to wait longer before re-introducing foods? Or, does this mean I have permanent narrowing of my esophagus and I should continue with the diet, only paying attention to whether foods get stuck in my throat to determine my triggers?\n\nFor what it's worth, I have a hard time telling the status of my condition. For example, on a day when I eat oatmeal and soup, I don't have any issues swallowing. So, every morning of my elimination diet, I have been eating spoonfuls of cooked quinoa (yes, wonderful), and seeing if it gets stuck and I need to wash it down with water.

My doc strongly recommended against discontinuing Prilosec mainly because of my EoE. He said it could lead to Barrett\u2019s esophagus/cancer but I could always try the special diets instead, and to start taking Prilosec again if the symptoms come back. \n\nSo is there anyone out there with these conditions that has been successful in managing EoE, GERD, and IBS without PPIs?

Recently my EoE has been pretty well managed as I\u2019ve figured out all of my triggers (to my knowledge, aside from environmental which I can\u2019t rly avoid) to the point where I\u2019m off meds. Over the past months/years, I\u2019ve experienced a lot of vomiting, getting worse with time. A lot of times this is a result from alcohol (not getting too drunk, literally could be one drink that triggers it. Been cutting it out more recently) or just out of the blue entirely, sometimes after I eat and other times not. I tried to do some research but I was wondering if anybody would have any idea, could this be an EoE side effect or is it likely unrelated? I\u2019ve always dealt with vomiting from EoE, but it\u2019s been so much lately (like once a week w throwing up 2-4 times at once) that I\u2019m getting concerned. Not sure what to do. I plan on seeing a dr but right now I\u2019m about to change insurance so I\u2019d rather not start seeing someone then have to change bc of a new plan.

it\u2019s progressively became worse (has felt like anything from painless abdominal fullness especially at first to severe sharp, colicky pain and is mostly worsened by movement). I\u2019ve recently lost lots of weight due to not eating as much and find I subconsciously turn to crackers and simple carbs because my body tolerates better for some reason. I typically do not have gas, bloating, or flatulence.  I have barky cough (typical of reflux) and I have asthma.  I never felt heartburn until recently and it comes seconds after the severe colicky sharp pain I get.  And also very recent is that the sharp pain has started occurring on the opposite side slightly higher up. The whole thing has just gotten progressively worse and I feel chronically ill vs the discomfort this all started out as.  I\u2019ve had change in bowel habits, so I know IBS could be possibility as part of it, but only small part of my upper left abdomen is producing pain and no digestive cramping.  There is brown/orange mucus in stool, so it\u2019s definitely possible. \n\nI\u2019ve considered hernia because ER doctor mentioned it, but out of all the scans I\u2019ve had, only gallbladder polyp has shown up and it\u2019s since disappeared according to imaging.  I\u2019ve had CT w/ contrast, abdominal ultrasound, endoscopy and colonoscopy.  Blood work is mostly normal besides a few markers here and there. Lipase is still normal, but has been trending downward last few years and is at 17. Anyways, the endoscopy found mild chronic inactive gastritis (pylori was negative and haven\u2019t ever been heavy NSAID user) and esophagus looked normal, but when biopsy came back, it said \u2018moderate to severe basal hyperplasia and 130 eosinophils per high power field\u2019.  I\u2019m supposed to have pH measured from reflux to know more, but the doctors seem to be brushing off the severe type pain I\u2019m having and when I brought up gallbladder disease, he just said it\u2019s probably fine because CT didn\u2019t show anything, but I requested endoscopic ultrasound because I feel it could be something along those lines. I just know that the sudden sharp abdominal pain seems to trigger the burning sensation seconds after. Could that be bile reflux? Does anyone know if bile can cause eosinophils as high as mine are, or if EoE can cause the abdominal pain and burning.  Doctors haven\u2019t been able to help me out.

I've had EoE for about 17 years, diagnosed about 9 years ago, and have been around the block a few times. I just looked up this sub tonight.\n\nI seem to have absorption issues with Iron and Vitamin D, and I suspect I have some other deficiencies too.\n\nI tried to see a Gastroenterologist recently to ask for help with this, and wound up seeing a PA that was about as useful as the WebMD page on IBS. In other words not much use at all.\n\nI've been on PPIs for the last 6 or 7 years, and was on them for a few years back in 2007-2010 or so.\n\nOn the iron deficiency front, I only recently found out that it takes about 120mg of elemental iron a day for 3-4 months (not the 25 or so I was taking) to replenish iron stores for people with normal absorption. Since starting a higher dose, the thinning hair on top of my head has started to grow back in. I see about 3x as many active follicles after 6 weeks of so-so compliance.\n\nI also have had to take 20,000IU of vitamin D liquid to get my D levels from 25 (insufficient) to 34 (30-100 is \"sufficient\") most days of the week for months on end. Normal supplementation is like 5,000-10,000IU a day at the very most, and many doctors recommend only 2,000. \n\nI'm looking for 2 things:\n\nHow do you find better than average Gastro doctors? Is there an index or rating somewhere? I live in Portland OR, have seen about 5, and found most of them pretty clueless about everything relating to me. I've seen things like Healthgrades, but they are pretty vague and generic.\n\nSecond, is there solid evidence about PPIs and absorption issues in the form of studies on long-term use? I am looking for published peer-reviewed articles only. Even if there is solid evidence, how do people deal with quitting PPIs and the acid issues? The limits on most of the acid reducers like Zantac, famotidine, and so on are 1/4 of what I need on a good day. \n\nFor anyone curious, I swallow Flovent/fluticasone powder, cromolyn liquid, and 20mg of pantoprazole.

The gastroenterologist that treated me said that she noticed my chart said I had mild asthma, and that I may have a condition that is sometimes tied to asthma based on my raised level of eosinophils.  She also recommended I see an allergy specialist since it could also be tied to food allergies.\n\nI have always had severe pollen allergies and Oral Allergy Syndrome. My journey with the allergist revealed peanut/tree nut allergies, along with a few other \"hits\"--- enough to show up on the report, but not as high of a rating as the peanuts.  I eliminated those foods.  I had a follow up with the GI doctor, but she ultimately moved across country so this piece of the story ends here.  I would try and eat carefully and avoid eating solids on days my throat felt \"tight\" for the following years.\n\nFast forward to just a couple years ago--a food impaction from a piece of chicken.  I go to a different hospital, and a different GI doctor treats me.  He tells me he had to use the pediatric scope on me, and I need to follow up because I will need dilation.  My appointment is a disaster as the doctor tears my esophagus trying to get the scope in (thankfully NOT all the way through), so the procedure is aborted.  They have me on omeprazole daily, but after a year I take myself off it because I am not seeing any improvement, nor do I feel the physician is being helpful in trying to determine a cause/treatment plan.\n\nA few weeks ago, a blueberry got stuck.  I managed to cough and gag and spit it up before it got lodged enough to merit an ER trip.  I then decided I needed to try and start over.  I booked an appointment with a GI doctor from the original practice that treated me (letting them know to pull my old records) and plan to start all over again.\n\n**That leads me to the purpose of this post.**  I am trying to put together a list of my questions, concerns, and have an idea of what type of response/treatment suggestions I should be looking for from my physician prior to going to my appointment.  Too many times I have felt dismissed my doctors, and I want to be ready to advocate for myself.  I know I want an endoscopy to view my current state/the level of eosinophils and ideally dilation, followed by an elimination diet of the top items to see if I have any additional triggers I am not aware of.  Beyond that, I am not sure what I should be asking for.  I realize everyone's journey is different, but I would love to hear insight from others who have walked in these shoes.

I eat a pretty clean diet, but do have food get stuck on occasion and from time to time have the classic chest pain right behind my breastbone. I've been on 20mg of Omeprazole for as long as I've been diagnosed. When trying to taper off of it over the years, I have issues and have to go back on it. As long as I'm on that and am careful with my diet, I'd say my EoE has been fairly well managed. The only lingering issue is food getting stuck. That does happen and I've had some close calls with chocking. So, there's some background. \n\nMy current issue is that about 5 weeks ago I started having terrible trapped gas in my chest along with the chest pain behind my breastbone. At the same time and not. I mean, nearly all day long. Never waking at night with it though. \n\nThe only change is I used to exercise regularly until a job change about a year ago. I also did get recent blood tests that were not good. LDL is off the charts. A LOT of stress over the last year.\n\nMy regular Dr did an EKG and sent me to my GI Dr. He feels like it's my EoE and doubled my Omeprazole to 40mg. I've been on it two weeks and I have, perhaps 50% improvement. I have even had a couple of days with hardly any problem at all and then it comes right back. For the last 4 days I've taken 40mg morning and night (Dr said to) with no signs of it helping. \n\nWith exercise, sometimes the trapped gas, burping is worse, sometimes it's not. I think stress might also influence it some. I seem to generally have less on the weekend, I think. \n\nI got an echo yesterday, no results yet. My insurance has denied a stress test twice. I was supposed to have one on Friday and they denied it...\n\nI'm stressed out anyway and this is making me stress more. So.. is it the EoE or is it possibly something to do with my heart? \n\nI've been in a similar place a few times before (but never with this much pain / trapped gas) and have had stress tests, echos but they were fine. The last one was about three years ago.\n\nSo, I fluctuate between, I'm not going to throw a fit about my heart again because I've done this before,  why the hell wouldn't I want to make sure it's not my heart. Should I go to the hospital or not? \n\nI'm not even sure I have a question. Just wanting to write this out and if anyone has had a similar experience, I'd love to hear about it. \n\nAnyone had trapped gas and chest pain that lasts an entire day or days?\n\nThanks.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2355, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "EoE / Chest Pain / Trapped Gas / Heart", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/o6r7q0/eoe_chest_pain_trapped_gas_heart/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Duffyfades", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9tjnx7ol", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1624458374, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/o6dvjm/i_found_a_retrospective_survey_of_chops_patients/", "gildings": {}, "id": "o6dvjm", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/o6dvjm/i_found_a_retrospective_survey_of_chops_patients/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "qrZlsmyTtsVxgLbmemnqExZ5TVbi6UW3FQV77YJtbv4", "resolutions": [{"height": 112, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/pH1agCpPcbRJvQKWQZAm7aCRjQqr8aED0niKh3UCMoE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b8b650eda7a56ec1d2b490e5f3134ad9986685a", "width": 108}, {"height": 224, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/pH1agCpPcbRJvQKWQZAm7aCRjQqr8aED0niKh3UCMoE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c22ee8e0370882252143e5a7cb164a3c83b69eb", "width": 216}, {"height": 332, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/pH1agCpPcbRJvQKWQZAm7aCRjQqr8aED0niKh3UCMoE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33dc434075e1b79b5752b423fe3165d5c0efadf8", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 391, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/pH1agCpPcbRJvQKWQZAm7aCRjQqr8aED0niKh3UCMoE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=2e6a4c577fe81cda72b186b0b03482086e0da168", "width": 376}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1624458385, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm hoping these data can help people who didn't get resolution on the six food diet.\n\nThis is a retrospective study of all their EOE patients between 1995 and 2004, and food data from initial elemental diet, then reintroduction of foods once every five days over nine months.

I\u2019m not sure what my eosinophil levels were, but I needed a dilation to help open up my esophagus. I initially got the endoscopy done because I was having  upper abdominal and stomach pain which we suspected was gastritis. Turns out my stomach mucosa is fine and that my esophagus is inflamed.  I\u2019ve never really had any of the \u2018traditional\u2019 EoE symptoms like difficulty swallowing or food getting stuck in throat. My only symptom has been stomach pain and occasional heartburn. Is there anyone else on here who doesn\u2019t have the common symptoms and only has stomach pain? I was given Pantoprazole to help with the stomach pain which has been helping somewhat.  In addition to the Endoscopy, I\u2019ve recently seen an allergist to help narrow down some of the possible allergens. I\u2019m aware that skin prick tests aren\u2019t exactly accurate for EoE, but my GI doc and I both thought it would be a good starting point. I am allergic to wheat, soy, peanuts, fish, walnuts, pistachios, and had strong allergic reactions to almonds and legumes. I\u2019m not allergic to dairy and eggs. I\u2019ve already cut out gluten previously because we thought there could be a possibility of celiac (tested negative from biopsy) or a gluten intolerance. Previously, I was consuming a lot of tree nuts and legumes, but have since cut them out since my trip to the allergist. As for my next steps what would be best? A 6 food elimination diet or a 4 food diet including legumes and excluding dairy and eggs)? I have an appointment with my GI doc next month, but I\u2019m wondering what would be a good action plan for the time being?

They\u2019ve evolved over the years, going from nausea to reflux, and now swallowing issues. About two years ago I was put on Omeprazole for GERD - never really stuck with it - I\u2019m not great with swallowing pills. Fast forward to the present - for the past 2.5 weeks I\u2019ve had some pretty extreme swallowing issues and have dropped to an underweight BMI. \nMy flare up began during finals week; now I\u2019m on my summer break, relatively stress free and it hasn\u2019t gotten much better. I go through some meals free from impaction, but then every once in awhile (usually at a family dinner) something will get stuck and I\u2019ll force it down with water (I can\u2019t go anywhere without my water bottle). \n\nAs I\u2019ve been researching this, I\u2019ve developed a few questions - \n1) what does an impaction feel like to you guys? 2) could EoE cause choking in sleep? (It\u2019s been a source of anxiety for me for awhile now). 3) I\u2019m on a low dose of Omeprazole - how long should it take to feel a difference assuming I have GERD that\u2019s causing an EE flare? 4) what is the timeline for the elimination diet? When should I begin to test things? 5) is an endoscopy necessary for a diagnosis? (I have emetophobia and I genuinely don\u2019t think I can handle an endoscopy). 6) has your chewing been affected? For me, when I start chewing, if I think about it too much it makes me nauseous and I physically can\u2019t begin swallowing. \n\nMy symptoms - \nNausea \nStomach fullness\nSour taste in mouth (especially after eating)\nDiffering levels of swallowing difficulty throughout day. \nStomach pain below ribs (sometimes) \nLoss of appetite\nDifficulty with food\nCan swallow water fine\nExcess saliva \nClearing of throat\nGeneral discomfort \n\nMy symptoms seen to be exacerbated by anxiety and stress.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2317, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A few question from someone exploring the possibility of having EoE", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/nwj1b7/a_few_question_from_someone_exploring_the/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "honqueduck", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6yt0xdbc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1623284454, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/nwae1i/trouble_gaining_weight/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nwae1i", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/nwae1i/trouble_gaining_weight/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1623284802, "score": 1, "selftext": "Do you guys have trouble gaining weight?

Every single time I would be left wondering if I was just a shitty chewer or if I was just dealing with leftover scarring from the steak incident and just hoped it would stop.\n* Two weeks ago I did an endoscopy.\n* Last night I played a late hockey game, drank a few IPAs, and picked up taco bell on the way home. I'll spare you the details but cleaning up my car was a nightmare and I went to bed really just sad that my problems seemed hopeless.\n* Today I finally got my results from the endoscopy.\n\nSo yeah, now I'm here because my results are \"in line with eosinophilic esophagitis\" and honestly, I'm just so happy it's not like \"inconclusive\".\n\nI'm being prescribed a steroid and omeprazole, so hopefully that helps, and I have the allergist appointment in two weeks.\n\nHonestly, the biggest thing I'm worried about is cutting anything out of my diet. I like being able to eat and drink anything, and I like taking advantage of that and trying new things all the time.

Ever since I started with reflux symptoms a few months ago (now know it\u2019s EoE), I\u2019ve just felt like my entire body is falling apart \ud83d\ude10", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EosinophilicE", "subreddit_id": "t5_30s0l", "subreddit_subscribers": 2287, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Sleep Apnea connection?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/np7i64/sleep_apnea_connection/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Needabreakfromeoe", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bfhwof46", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1622473411, "domain": "self.EosinophilicE", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/np5fzc/new_food_allergies_after_introducing_foods_in/", "gildings": {}, "id": "np5fzc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EosinophilicE/comments/np5fzc/new_food_allergies_after_introducing_foods_in/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1622474577, "score": 2, "selftext": "I   \\[26m\\] have been diagnosed with Eosinophilic esophagitis for a few  years  now. I wanted to be medication free (40mg of omeprazole/ day) so I   started a four-food elimination diet in cooperation with a  dietician   and a gastro-enterologist. I test positive for gluten and dairy. The   dietician allowed me to re-introduct soy and egg at the same time,   because test-results showed that realistically EoE should not react to   2+ food groups.\n\nHowever, after   re-introducting soy and egg for five days I get angioedema in my mouth,   cheeks and lips from eating sesame and mustard in any form. At first   this went away after a few hours and an antihistaminicum but at some   point I was swollen all night, even after swallowing 2  antihistaminicum   and an aerosol corticosteroid. I have never experienced any problems   with these ingredients, or any ingredients for that matter, before.\n\nI   just recieved the results from a scratch and blood test that not only   mustard and sesame are culprits, but possibly pumpkin seeds and pine   nuts as well. I now have an EPI-pen - better safe than sorry.\n\nThe allergist said it's highly unusual that you get severe food allergies after re-introducing food in an elimination diet.\n\nOn sunday I'm eathing sesame &amp; sea salt crackers with humus and it's fine, thursday it's a severe food allergy?\n\nDo you have any experiences like this?
