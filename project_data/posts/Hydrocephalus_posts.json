They found him unconscious in his apartment last Thursday.  He could have been there for up to 36 hours before being found.  They don't know why.  His shunt seems to be ok, but I really don't like or trust these doctors, but we are stuck with them at this point.\n\nHe is very confused and keeps asking me to take him home.  I patiently explain that he is in the hospital, but he looks so damn sad.\n\nI am so tired of this.  This doctor won't listen to me.  I don't know what caused him to go unconscious, but I do know that re-programming his shunt to a lower pressure makes him worse.  I know it, the rest of the family knows it, but the doc won't believe me.  He points to a scan and laughs at me.  I don't care about the scan.  I know he's worse because his memory is worse, his gait is worse, his vision is worse and he just has \"that look\".\n\nSo he came here on a helicopter and the first thing they did was lower his pressure, despite the fact that they said his shunt was working just fine.  He woke up and was actually pretty aware. The first thing he said to me after they removed the ventilator was \"What happened?\".  He knew he was in the hospital, etc.  Now, two days later, he's getting more confused, his memory sucks and he looks \"shunty\".  It's because they turned his pressure down...but the doc won't believe me.\n\nThe longer he keeps the pressure low, the harder it will be to move it back up.  When we turn the pressure up, my son's ventricles tend to really over-react and balloon up.  I was afraid at one point that he would never get better because we would never be able to get his pressure up to where he does better. \n\n We managed to do so because I sent him out of state to another doc who put in a different shunt.  My son was doing so well for about a year, then this happened.  I can't send him back to the other doc now as he is too serious to move and it's across the country.  I am stuck with this horrible doctor.\n\nThe old doc is caring for him and he fucking won't LISTEN to me.  When I say he's been doing great for a year, he says \"Well look at him now!\"  He totally discounts the YEAR my son has had with no headaches, better memory, being able to walk unaided because this episode happened.   He says that the shunt didn't cause his episode, but then has re-programmed it.  He won't turn it back up, even though my kid was doing well with it like that for a year.  I feel like I am insane because he acts like what I tell him is impossible and it is not.  I know it is not normal, but my son wasn't diagnosed until he was 11.  Maybe his brain just developed with high pressure and that's why he does better that way.  Whatever it is...it took me five years and a cross country doctor to get him fixed and now this asshole is going to un-do what I worked so hard to do.\n\nBut then again, I am afraid to flat out demand he do it because I'm not a doc and what if I am wrong, but I've been down this road before and it sucks.  What if I put my foot down and my kid gets worse?  What if he goes unconscious again and doesn't come back?  I am so frustrated.  I know, know, know that he needs that shunt turned back up NOW, but I can't trust that judgement.\n\nI am very afraid, very sad and don't know what to do.\n\nThe only theory they have come up with for why he went unconscious that makes sense to me is that he was severely constipated.  They think that maybe that blocked up the end of his VP shunt. That makes so much sense to me that he would be fine when he first woke up and now he's not because of the shunt re-programming, but he won't listen.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Frustrated and sad.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2h767h/frustrated_and_sad/"}, {"author": "BearPunch1138", "author_created_utc": 1401834860, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_gu36a", "created_utc": 1411172300, "domain": "constantlycalibrating.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2gwryn/fulcrum_the_squid_good_news_meet_bad_news/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2gwryn", "is_self": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2gwryn/fulcrum_the_squid_good_news_meet_bad_news/", "retrieved_on": 1441162548, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "thumbnail": "http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-uNwa2oH_qnSbS2X-3rhhKv1obY-tblrYgI45CeWx7c.jpg", "title": "Fulcrum the Squid: Good News, Meet Bad News [Blog/Vlog on finding out my unborn son has hydrocephalus]", "url": "http://constantlycalibrating.com/Fulcrum1"}, {"author": "momof3punkins", "author_created_utc": 1380205841, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_dajng", "created_utc": 1410701403, "domain": "hydroawareness.wordpress.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2gd83n/hydrocephalus_awareness_like_never_before/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2gd83n", "is_self": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2gd83n/hydrocephalus_awareness_like_never_before/", "retrieved_on": 1441171733, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "thumbnail": "http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wCD7o5_mIscYlyo8IOaGKcBp5RiAGrEwb1ayqlhoLgg.jpg", "title": "Hydrocephalus Awareness like never before!", "url": "http://hydroawareness.wordpress.com/2014/09/14/hydrocephalus-awareness-like-never-before/"}, {"author": "momof3punkins", "author_created_utc": 1380205841, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_dajng", "created_utc": 1409509490, "domain": "hydroawareness.wordpress.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2f3mgn/hydrocephalus_awareness_month_graphics/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2f3mgn", "is_self": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2f3mgn/hydrocephalus_awareness_month_graphics/", "retrieved_on": 1441193243, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "thumbnail": "http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/nrVZKmOwEL4r47yNCyauXdX_QbCcR16NguCkcqh_n3c.jpg", "title": "Hydrocephalus Awareness Month graphics", "url": "http://hydroawareness.wordpress.com/2014/08/31/hydrocephalus-awareness-month-graphics/"}, {"author": "IvanStyle", "author_created_utc": 1393356441, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_fg4q1", "created_utc": 1409058907, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2emgtw/september_hydrocephalus_awareness_month/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2emgtw", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2emgtw/september_hydrocephalus_awareness_month/", "retrieved_on": 1441201309, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hey guys, with Hydrocephalus Awareness Month happening next week are there any events or anything that are happening?

New here and excited to find some sort of forum. My son is 5 and had his first shunt placed last May, first revision last week (the valve actually broke and the tubing came disconnected). His doctors are awesome and we are no strangers to the medical field but there's surprisingly few support groups near us, especially when it's just Hydro and not related to multiple other things. \nSince his shunt placement, he's been great. He bounced back from the surgery extremely well (he seems to have a very, very good pain tolerance for some reason) &amp; after his revision last week we have been the ones trying to hold him back from his activity. He had some eye wandering (exotropia) that completely resolved after the shunt but then developed esotropia and now has glasses. Other than that, he very healthy and extremely smart. \nI would be interested to see if any other moms here or younger kids/even adults report any difficulty with attention spans, depth perception, clumsiness, general quirkiness or difficult behaviors...we have been looking for support from someone regarding all this and finally found an OT that says she thinks he has Sensory Integration Disorder which I'll admit sounds a bit made up but research shows me he fits a lot of this pretty well...still I wonder if his behaviors are a direct result of his hydro and the way his brain functions now.\n\nAnyways, I'm just glad to find this subreddit and hope more people discover and start posting!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New here &amp; glad for the group", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2b7del/new_here_glad_for_the_group/"}, {"author": "momof3punkins", "author_created_utc": 1380205841, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_dajng", "created_utc": 1404786720, "domain": "hydroawareness.wordpress.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2a3wxc/hydrocephalus_graphic/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2a3wxc", "is_self": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2a3wxc/hydrocephalus_graphic/", "retrieved_on": 1441278498, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "thumbnail": "http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ORrHybDeLyfETzxf.jpg", "title": "Hydrocephalus graphic", "url": "http://hydroawareness.wordpress.com/2014/07/07/hydrocephalus-graphic/"}, {"author": "momof3punkins", "author_created_utc": 1380205841, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_dajng", "created_utc": 1403889273, "domain": "hydroawareness.wordpress.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2996sy/one_reason/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2996sy", "is_self": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/2996sy/one_reason/", "retrieved_on": 1441292956, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "thumbnail": "http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/BVlKyWn4TjIABfqH.jpg", "title": "One reason", "url": "http://hydroawareness.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/one-reason/"}, {"author": "PepperAnn90", "author_created_utc": 1315326943, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_5sxxg", "created_utc": 1398446495, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/23ysig/hydro_runs/", "gilded": 0, "id": "23ysig", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/23ysig/hydro_runs/", "retrieved_on": 1441564354, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I was wondering if anyone knew of any runs (specifically 5ks) for hydrocephalus?

They said they don't deal with \"behavioral\" problems so therefore they are refusing to write referals. Nevermind that while i was there in person they were open to helping with. They told me to ask our primary care to write referrals.The whole point of the neuropsych testing is to see what damage may have been caused at birth so he doesn't fall any further behind in school. I looked it up and he certainly qualifies with his medical history for proper testing. I am so angry that 2 months wasted waiting on paperwork to be signed to get put on a waiting list for the testing. I feel like the school is pushing to have him diagnosed with something because they don't want to deal with him. He is strugging in school. Always in trouble. I have asked for them to write me something stating the issues so i have documentation but I have not been given anything in writing.They lied to my face about a local program that could help him with possible learning disabilities. Thankfully I did an intake appt for that program already but we are also on a waiting list for that :( I'm completely lost now as to what to do as this school year is almost over and nobody seems to want to do their job.

I'm 17 revisions deep, with 5 just in the last year. I always had Medtronic valves, including one that lasted me 22 years. Tons of scar tissue and changing pressure needs have been an issue. Recently met with a new doctor who's a big proponent of Aesculap programmable valves \\(which apparently have a re\\-calibrating anti\\-siphon device that can be adjusted independently from the main valve as well.\\) \n\nAs a lot of you might experience, typically when a valve fails after a long time, it seems to take 2\\-3 revisions to get things working stably again. I've been hearing that with the Aesculap adjustable could help me to reduce or eliminate the need for repeated revisions in the same year since every component is programmable. The titanium construction would also be resistant to compression from scar tissue which may have caused my initial failure last year. Seems like a great idea but I wonder about the downside of not having a reservoir that can be tapped to relieve pressure if I'm waiting hours for the surgery.\n\nDoes any have experience with Aesculap valves? In practice, do you feel you've been able to avoid repeat revisions due to its reprogrammability? Any other pros, cons or things to get used to? \n\nAre they comfortable to wear? I had an OSV II valve for about 3 weeks before it failed and it was uncomfortable as shit due to its hard plastic construction. Aesculap valves seem more contoured but can't tell from diagrams.\n\n I'm particularly interested in hearing from adult patients born with the condition since I know we are kind of a unique case, but would welcome all responses. Also would be really like to hear from anyone switching over from Medtronic Delta or PS valves to Aesculap.\n\nThanks so much and best of health to all!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 216, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Any Congenital Hydrocephalus Adults use Aesculap Programmable Shunt?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/8fjpsd/any_congenital_hydrocephalus_adults_use_aesculap/"}, {"author": "ijustwantathrwy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1524818975, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/8fa65q/some_weird_new_symptoms/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8fa65q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/8fa65q/some_weird_new_symptoms/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1524823214, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 5, "selftext": "So I've had hydrocephalus since birth, I'm in my mid-twenties now and have been lucky enough to only have 2 surgeries, both when I was 12.

This year the teacher has been a little more helpful letting me know specifically his behavior rather than \"oh he was bad\" She told me a couple months ago he gets distracted easy, is very unorganized, his desk is always a mess. All of the sudden he is having issues chewing on his shirt and pencils. He refuses to do his work and has fallen asleep in class. He gets emotional if you call him out on anything.The teacher and principal called me last night for an intervention. It is possible it may just be an anxiety thing but to be safe I am about to call neurology to have a check up. I remember them telling me if he suddenly falls behind in school or has issues being sleepy or stomach issues to call them. \n  ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Son has hydrocephalus", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/813eu8/son_has_hydrocephalus/"}, {"author": "MusicBoxElderBug", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1519098219, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/7ysxfn/weather_changes/", "id": "7ysxfn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/7ysxfn/weather_changes/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1519153764, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "What are some of the best ways to deal with weather changes and barometric pressure when you have a shunt?

Throughout my childhood I had zero limitations on sports I could do, so I was an active kid. I even became a (relatively) successful swimmer, and was able to swim for one of the best teams in the NCAA. \nI would go to a doctor once a year for them to check my head out, but they always said that I was fine and eventually we just stopped going to the doctor. \n\nHowever, in the summer of 2015, during a routine weight session I felt a pop in my neck and after meeting with our medical staff we came to the conclusion that the shunt, or at least the calcification around it, had broke.  After a number of different doctors visits and a number of different tests, doctors determined that I did not need the shunt anymore and that they problem had fixed its self; I then had surgery to have the shunt removed.\n\nFast forward less than a month and I had symptoms that many sufferers of hydrocephalus have: Headaches, vomiting, blackouts. I needed emergency surgery to get a shunt put in again, therefore confirming that I do in fact need it. \n\nTl;Dr, I have hydrocephalus and have had virtually zero complications and live a normal life, one that is equivalent to a person without hydrocephalus.

These symptoms have progressively gotten worse and in the last 3 months, we have been in the emergency room at least 10 times with episodes of him passing out or having these symptoms for days on end with no relief from prescribed medications.\n\nHis mother and I firmly believe that the shunt is partially malfunctioning- whether that means that he needs a new valve or a new pressure setting or something. The valve in his shunt has never been replaced and is not adjustable, therefore it has been set at the same pressure for 36 years. Unfortunately, all of his tests have come back negative, which is actually normal for him. During his last shunt failure, the CT scan and shunt series and eye pressure tests were normal, so they did exploratory surgery and found that the stint was clogged. \n\nThe doctors now are refusing to do anything more than medicating the symptoms, which is so frustrating. How do we get the doctors to listen to us? This has been going on for so long but we don't have any answers. Has anyone heard of a partial shunt failure like this?

My wife with gave birth to him after 5 hrs of grueling labor, in the last minutes of the labor he got stuck. They advised us that they would like to keep him overnight to monitor him since he had such a rough delivery. As parents of a two year old as well(his birth was super quick) this was all new to us. The next morning they told us that his breathing was erratic and that he was having a tough time making his own oxygen so they wanted to keep him in the nicu until they could get him stabilized. 24 hrs later he was doing great. His breathing was stabilized, they took him off of oxygen and removed his iv and mommy was gonna be able to start breast feeding. 30 minutes later he developed a fever of 102.1 and they were unable to diagnose it. They advised us that we should send him to Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital to have him evaluated and give him further resources that the regional hospital we were at didn\u2019t have. So 5 days after delivery he was on his way by ambulance to Children\u2019s. To spare the long 29 days we had there, he had 3 spinal taps, a ekg, multiple mri\u2019s, X-rays, and countless amounts of blood work with no diagnosis. But with the MRI they noticed brain bleeds and enlarged ventricles. So neurology came on board to review his case. They noticed that his ventricles have continued to increase in size but it has only been a slight increase. After 29 days we onward home for the first time in over a month. Since our time at home his bottle feeding has gotten really good, he\u2019s such a happy little man he\u2019s always smiling especially to the people he knows the most. The neurology specialist had us coming once a month to get head ultrasounds but our last visit she pushed us out to every two months. His fontanelle has always stayed soft, his head continues to enlarge in size(this week he\u2019s at 43 1/2 cm) it enlarges about a cm every two weeks. He\u2019s starting to get some spider veins on this sides of his forehead but overall he seems really healthy.

It affects people in all walks of life, from every socioeconomic background.\n    One to two of every 1,000 babies are born with hydrocephalus, making it as common as Down\u2019s syndrome and more common than spina bifida or brain tumors.\n    Hydrocephalus is the most common reason for brain surgery in children.\n\n**There Is No Cure**\n\n    There is no medical therapy to treat hydrocephalus. The only effective treatments are surgical.\n    While many people are helped by surgery, many more need further operations to stay well. Of the over 40,000 hydrocephalus operations performed annually (one every 15 minutes), only 30% are the patient\u2019s first surgery to treat hydrocephalus.\n    The medical costs for hydrocephalus are over $1 billion per year, yet the National Institutes of Health (NIH) invests less than $1 million per year in hydrocephalus treatment.\n\n**There Is a Crisis in Diagnosis**\n\n    A recent study estimates that 700,000 older Americans are living with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). This disorder often goes undiagnosed and untreated, with an estimate that up to 80% of cases remain unrecognized.\n    Of the estimated 5.2 million individuals diagnosed with dementia, 10-15% are believed to actually have NPH, which is treatable.\n    Research suggests that treating hydrocephalus in the elderly population would reduce U.S. health care expenditures by $25,000 per patient, or $184 million, over five years. Mistaken placement in an extended care facility or nursing home, for example, costs considerably more than the minimal extra care someone might need to stay at home after appropriate treatment for NPH.\n    Hydrocephalus also goes undiagnosed and untreated in younger adults, leading to substantial workforce loss and health care costs.\n\n**There Is a Crisis in Access to Care**\n\n    Doctors are sometimes understandably reticent to take on complicated hydrocephalus cases, particularly in adults, because little is known about the disorder. We don\u2019t always know what causes it, and we don\u2019t yet know how to make these people well.\n    There are fewer then ten centers in the U.S. specializing in treating adults with hydrocephalus.\n\n**More Effective Treatment Is Needed Now**\n\n    Over the last 50 years, there has been no significant improvement in hydrocephalus treatment and no progress toward prevention or cure.\n    Research is essential. At the very least, we need better treatments, with more positive long-term outcomes, and diagnostic tests that are accurate, cost-effective, and noninvasive.\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hydrocephalus Facts &amp; Stats", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/3pfgr8/hydrocephalus_facts_stats/"}, {"author": "TheOneTrueCripple", "author_created_utc": 1345560323, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_8qp1z", "created_utc": 1445294226, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/3pewg3/something_on_which_i_have_yet_to_get_a_decent/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3pewg3", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/3pewg3/something_on_which_i_have_yet_to_get_a_decent/", "retrieved_on": 1450720196, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Every now &amp; again, I get this weird sensation of pressure from the inside of my head, as if it's pushing outwards.

I was 19 years old, living alone with her in our former apartment. One morning i woke up to loud noises coming from the living room. I stepped outside, and saw my mother walking around confused and crying her eyes out. I asked her what was wrong, but she couldn't explain and just kept crying. At that moment she barely knew where she was and none of her sentences made sense. It was just a big mixture of worries, that suddenly came to her mind. I had never seen this irrational behavior from her before.\n\nAll the windows in our apartment where open, and she had thrown some of our stuff out on the streets. I couldn't get through to her, and didn't knew what to do, so i called 911. When the paramedic arrived, they checked her, and said it looked like an anxiety attack. She was still unresponsive to what was wrong, so they took her in the ambulance and drove off to the hospital. Since we didn't own a car, i called my grand parents who i drove to the hospital with.\n\nAfter several hours at the hospital, she finally relaxed, and was able to talk with. She got diagnosed with 'excess water on the brain'; Hydrocephalus. She may have been born with it, but came to show now. The following weeks, she dealt with anxiety, which she got anti-depressive medicine prescribed for, which she still takes, but isn't anxious anymore though. After a while, we went to the hospital to get her pressure checked. I couldn't be there, but i was told they ran some basic cognitive tests, and measured the pressure to conclude, that there was no need for a so-called shunt or drainage. It would cause more damage than helping her, i was told.\n\nThis happened in the first months, after the diagnosis. Afterwards and ever since she start developing, what i would call, bipolar symptoms. I don't know anyone that's bipolar, but her mood and mind runs in cycles. Usually weeks or months at a time. She's either really 'down' or really 'up'. Depressive or manic. You're not in doubt on which 'cycle' she's in, and you easily notice when she changes. The contrast in her moods are so strong, to the point where she can't live a normal life anymore. Her doctor is just treating this as a brain damage, and there's nothing more to do. I've mentioned the bipolar symptoms, but she says there's nothing to it, ''it's just a brain damage and there's nothing to do''. The only medicine she takes, is the anti-depressive, which is a low dose. Sometimes, her doctor regulates the dose. I can't see why, cause it doesn't changes anything. \n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this? Heavy mood swings like the symptoms of bipolar disorder, linked to Hydrocephalus? Could a shunt or mood stabilizing medicine help her? If anyone knows what to do to help and ease these symptoms, please write.\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hydrocephalus and bipolar?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/3fo4q8/hydrocephalus_and_bipolar/"}, {"author": "ProfReport", "author_created_utc": 1436352589, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_omeb6", "created_utc": 1438251696, "domain": "egypt-business.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/3f57zt/20092019_l2aminobutanamide_hydrochloride_industry/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3f57zt", "is_self": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/3f57zt/20092019_l2aminobutanamide_hydrochloride_industry/", "retrieved_on": 1440579971, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "2009-2019 L-2-Aminobutanamide Hydrochloride Industry Development Research For Global and Chinese Market", "url": "http://www.egypt-business.com/Ticker/details/1531-2009-2019-L-2-Aminobutanamide-Hydrochloride-Industry-Development-Research-For-Global-and-Chinese-Market/15393"}, {"author": "Charrito5", "author_created_utc": 1329629410, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6yl9s", "created_utc": 1436746803, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/3d2i51/subreddit_improvments_need_your_help/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3d2i51", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/3d2i51/subreddit_improvments_need_your_help/", "retrieved_on": 1440615377, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nThanks to u/UnEntitled I recently became a moderator of this subreddit.

The first was inserted during infancy on my right hand side, and failed when I was 17, in 2006. They didn't feel comfortable mucking around with it given how long it had been embedded in my body so they instead simply installed a new one on my left side.\n\nSituation now is that I've got into bodybuilding and weight lifting since them. And especially over the last several months since I've been doing some serious poundage on the dumbbell bench press (targets the pecs by squeezing them together), I'm becoming more and more \"aware\" of the old, defunct shunt. It's not *painful* per se, it's just becoming very \"present\" and quite uncomfortable. When I lie on my side, I can feel the neck portion being stretched from my pec muscle and this aches a bit. \n\nObviously being as paranoid as many in the internet age I'm haunted by visions of the older shunt one day snapping, with who knows what consequences, or either one of them slipping off my collar bone and into the hollow between the collar bones (this probably has a name?) - I don't know how founded or unfounded these fears are, but I'd be very happy if there was a way to extend the shunt tubing so both shunts have more room to stretch out as my muscles keep developing. Lifting has given me a huge amount of confidence and I'm determined not to give it up unless I exhaust every possibility of making bulking up compatible with having a shunt, so really just looking for some advice as to what can be done and what should be done.\n\nAny insights?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can a VP shunt be extended?

We took him to see a neurologist and they did a CAT scan and said the his ventricles had a lot more fluid then back in August and that he would need a shunt. \nJump to a few days ago, he had the shunt installed. \nHe seems better, he is much more talkative now. Before he only answered by shaking his head yes or no. \nBut the one thing that is concerning is that he still thinks he is back in August. He can't remember anything that was prior to the shunt being placed in. He is saying, \"Last Tuesday I was home working out and now I can't walk and have this pain in my head. The hospital did something wrong.\"  \nAny help in understanding this will be great appreciated.

I had my shunt reset and was on my way.\nMonths later in January of 2017, I went to the ER because my headaches were so bad. A CT scan revealed my valve had reset to 200, it is usually at 70. I do not know what changed the setting, possibly the MRI, possibly me hitting something though I do not recall hitting my head on anything. I had no symptoms other than a headache during that time. While my pressure was at 200, my ventricles did not change in size, I was fine walking, talking, passed all neurological exams, etc. My neurosurgeon suggested that because of this, I don't really use the shunt. I had my shunt reset back down to 70 and the headache subsided a lot, though I still had a bit of a dull headache.\nA couple weeks later, I went in for an X-Ray because I had a similar headache as the one I did when the pressure was at 200. X ray revealed my pressure was at 120, so my shunt had reset itself... again. All of these altered pressures have only resulted in me having a headache, I have no other symptoms, no nausea, vomiting, increased pressure behind my eyes, etc.\nIf I am not greatly affected by shunt pressure changes, what does that imply?\nMy neurosurgeon told me we have done everything non invasive, and that the only option now is an exploratory surgery.\nI am only asking this on here because I am curious if anyone has dealt with something similar.

We didn't know what that was so we did a lot of research to ease our mind on what we would be dealing with throughout our son's life.

My wife and I will answer the best we can. We hope and pray that his story can help anyone out there. \n\nHe had his first shunt surgery at a few days old. That's when problems started as the neurosurgeon (who we found out later only had 6 weeks of training with baby and work mostly on the elderly) put in an adult sized shunt in our child. That shunt got infected and Gabriel had 3 shunt revision and 1 new shunt put in while at the first hospital where he stayed for 110 days without coming home.\n\nGabriel then moved to our local children's hospital for a few more weeks before coming home for the 1st time in his life.\n\nHe was off and on in the hospital for a total of 8 1/2 months of his life. He spent a lot of time with him family who loved him so much.\n\nGabriel was scheduled for a cleft palate surgery Jan 2016 when he was going to turn 1 year old, but Gabriel was welcomed back to heaven to be in God's arms and care before he could get his cleft palate surgery done.\n\nWe took a few videos of him the first few weeks of his life until the one day one of his nurses told us at 5 weeks that they didn't expect Gabriel to last past 3 weeks. We were lucky enough to get 51 weeks with him in our lives.\n\nAfter he came home from the hospital for the last time on hospice care, we decided to put his story up on youtube for all to see who would like to. \n\nIf you would like to see his story which we are continuing to put up on youtube until the time we get to his funeral, please search youtube for either TopHatAndEars or Gabriel's Hydrocephalus Journey.

Have had a VP shunt all 18 years of my life, minus a little more than a week. Had a few scares through the years, but never a true malfunction and never a revision.\n\nI had some bad, scary pain and went to the ER Monday. They took x-rays and a CT scan. CT was normal. ER doctor thought there looked to be a break or a blockage in a bent out part of my neck.\n\nTuesday morning ended up at the local neurosurgeon's office and he said it looked calcified from the x-rays, and thought there might be a break. Didn't know if it was old or new. I remembered I was walking and reading about a week before and I tripped and fell, and felt pain in my neck, but I didn't think about my shunt then.\n\nThere's a part in my neck that's bent way out and feels abnormal. It's not going THROUGH the skin or really irritating it on the outside, but it looks pretty lumpy. It hurts all around there and if I touch it or bump it, pain shoots up and down my shunt.\n\nNow I'm starting to have focusing problems in my classes and in general. I'm not gonna say how long this took me to write. I've been having random dizzy spells and weird times where my vision can see depth (have pretty bad strabismus and no real constant depth perception). Last night I felt like I was going to be sick and also was sweating like a pig. I didn't have a fever, or at least my roommate didn't think so, but neither of us have a thermometer. It's been harder to walk back and forth to class balance and strength wise in my legs. I'm left handed, my shunt is on the right side, and my right arm feels more numb and way weaker than it should. I feel really out of it and lethargic. Am I imagining it?\n\nAnyways my main questions are:\n\n1. Does anyone else have experience with not having malfunctions or revisions, and might that mean my hydrocephalus might be under control without the shunt, especially because it's calcified?\n\n2. Does anyone have any experience with their shunt calcifying?\n\n3. When I was little, even if I only had a little headache, I'd rush off to the ER and get CTs, MRIs, even an ultrasound. It always ended in \"dehydration\", or non shunt related things. Now that there's a case for a shunt malfunction, the neurosurgeon in the town I'm in now doesn't seem concerned. I'm a sophomore in college in a medium sized city with one neurosurgeon. Should I calm down, or should I get a second opinion? Is freaking out over possible shunt malfunctions a pediatric thing?\n\nTL;DR: I'm scared for once a potential shunt malfunction is what it looks like and needs replaced, but my small town neurosurgeon is either too busy to deal with it or doesn't think it matters.\n\nSorry about the novel!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "0 malfunctions until now.

Originally I had a fixed VP shunt, and that was fine. I had some revisions because I had terrible referred pain in my shoulder, and my surgeon thought it was the tubing causing issues. \n\nFast forward to 2016 and I'm in the hospital with a serious brain infection, which it turns out was the cause of the shoulder pain. The neurosurgeon I who operated on me had put in a Variable shunt, which leads me to my current situation. \n\nFor the past two years i've had terrible symptoms whenever it rains or the barometric pressure changes. I get headaches, nausea, have that \"hat\" feeling around the top of my head, I feel pressure/almost water weight in my abdoment and sometimes have pain near where my catheter is.  \n\nThe real scary symptoms however are the mental ones. I lose my memory, I can't think straight, can't focus, and basically cannot work. My friends have also commented that my personality changes and I become very short tempered and sometimes irritable, which I know is because i'm trying to find words or do things and can't. \n\nI've been working with my neurologist the past 2 years to try and find a cure for the symptoms. I've tried nerve blockers, various medicine like Propranolol and Amovig. Nothing has seemed to realy help at all. \n\nI'm convinced the issue is the change from a fixed shunt to a variable shunt, especially since all of these symtpoms started after I fully healed after my surgery/infection. I also don't know if the symptoms related to rain/pressure happened immediately, because it took me a while (with help from friends) to realize the correlation between my episodes of mental dullness and the rain. \n\nI'm seeing another doctor now for a second opinion, but I wanted to ask if anyone has had similar situations or symptoms, and if I sound crazy. When it gets so bad I can't go to work i'm very concerned, and my neurosurgeon basically said \"pressure's fine, go talk to your neurologist\". \n\nAny advice would be helpful!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 650, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for advice on symptoms i've had for a while.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ib6l3q/looking_for_advice_on_symptoms_ive_had_for_a_while/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Logical-Vermicelli-2", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6dsc7vdy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597444037, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/i9vs4k/dealing_with_hydrocephalus/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i9vs4k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/i9vs4k/dealing_with_hydrocephalus/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597444048, "score": 1, "selftext": "I pretty much had hydrocephalus since an infant. When I was 11 I had a malfunction and it took a about 2 months being in the hospital for them to find that out. as always the shunt is the first thing they check but they didn\u2019t find anything with the regular cat scan. They had to take 3D imaging to actually see the malfunction. After that I felt much better a few headaches a month but nothing that was as bad as the ones from the malfunction.\n\nA few years after (14/15years old) it got bad again. It\u2019s very vague but I remember it was early in the year around December to January. It was very bad for a month straight from when I woke up to the time I went to sleep. The fact that laying down made it worse it was nothing I could do. These were very close to the headaches of the malfunction but not that bad. My mom ended up taking me to the emergency room which they examined me. We did all the things to make sure the shunt was working properly and it was. We stayed a few days and in that time they gave me something that did get rid of the headaches but it may very jittery like my arms would jump or my legs would kick.\n\nThey came to a conclusion I might have cluster headaches so I went home with some medication but it didn\u2019t work i was back in the emergency room and again nothing. My mom decided to schedule an appointment but at this time my pediatrician was out of town.\n\nWe came around to maybe it\u2019s my diet so we completely changed it he said caffeine was good though. At this point my head is still hurting nothing is changing all I wanted was to be able to go a day without these headaches. I don\u2019t remember too much but at the time I didn\u2019t understand this. He was trying to insinuate I was making the headaches up( at this point it\u2019s hard to focus but my mom was mad in the car) he prescribed something else which didn\u2019t work either. I forgot exactly what it was but when I looked it up it was for people who were in the military something along the lines of ptsd not exactly but basically more of a mind drug. We go back and he\u2019s talking about i should try to wait 2 to 3 months for it to work. Please put yourself in my shoes. Would you wait that long or go find another opinion. In this moment I\u2019m going on 2 months with these head aches with small breaks. I honestly stopped taking the medication but thankfully the headaches went away before spring break( I remember because my birthday was coming up).\n\nThis happened again the next year but before summer started. I had a good few hour gaps without headaches each week but this was still as bad. After a month we went to the emergency room and reminder at this point the headaches are draining me. Long story short they tried to say i was depressed but the nurse asked me some questions more specifically about my dad leaving and I felt kind of pushed to say it but she wanted to know if I missed him I answered yes but I really haven\u2019t thought of him that much anyways but it wasn\u2019t until we left my mom told me that they suspect depression. Now if I did look depressed which I probably was it was because of the torture of not knowing when these headaches would end. Each night I prayed for these headaches to go away. But it made me upset they didn\u2019t take into consideration that I look down because of my headaches. At this point I felt completely alone. The headaches did eventually go away and I\u2019m 18 now. I haven\u2019t been through that constant pain for sometime now. It makes me appreciate the little more. I had 1 bad headache this year at school that lasted a few hours which I cried it was so bad. I was happy once it went away ever since that they\u2019ve been more frequent but not bad at all maybe 2 6s a month at the most. \n\nDoes anybody else deal with these headaches that last a long period of time I usually use mint oil but with bad ones it doesn\u2019t work that good. What are some things or over the counter medicine that could help. Tylenol doesn\u2019t work at all to help. \n\n I don\u2019t want to make this too long so I will stop now but I would appreciate anybody\u2019s feedback. I\u2019ve just come to the realization I have to live with it but my family tries to help a lot. I\u2019m used to doing things with a headache but they just say sit down or take it slow. It\u2019s hard to explain to them especially since I know their only trying to help.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 649, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Dealing with hydrocephalus", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/i9vs4k/dealing_with_hydrocephalus/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hahayouhaveballs", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4uksejpk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597430037, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/i9righ/how_did_you_find_out_you_have_hydrocephalus/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i9righ", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 30, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/i9righ/how_did_you_find_out_you_have_hydrocephalus/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597430049, "score": 1, "selftext": "I had a massive brain tumor (vestibular schwannoma) and after they got all of the tumor out I started gushing CSF from my incision.

I was diagnosed with Hydrocephalus when I was 4 and my very religious parents refused the demand of my neurosurgeon to place a shunt. I had MRI's till I was 6 and they said it \"stabilized\" and my parents just treated me like nothing was wrong growing up except I wasn't allowed to play sports. I was told I was normal and always held to the standards of my siblings, peers and later, co-workers. My whole life I have been treated like I'm intentionally lazy, forgetful cause I don't care, selfish and other apathetic behavior I could not control. I also CANNOT multi-task. I can slowly do one thing at a time. I never did any homework growing up, barely got through school till 9th grade and dropped out because I felt I couldn't hack it. Part of the problem is that I've obsessively read and played instruments my whole life so since people saw me being proficient in those areas and looking pretty normal, they thought that my failures in other areas were just due to attitude. Fast forward to my 20's and I thought that I had ADHD and completely discounted the hydrocephalus as a cause of my distress. Treated with Ritalin with very little success. \n\nA couple years ago I had 2 severe concussions due to loss of vision (while still conscious) then falling and hitting my head on the ground. Since then my already embarrassing memory has degraded further. I lose track of conversations constantly, act impulsively, can't remember tasks to complete and even wound up getting fired from a grocery store for not working fast enough despite my best efforts.  My personality has also changed drastically very frequently and I have a hard time controlling my speech/temper and have started stuttering. I used to be functional enough to run a decent wedding photo business but there's no way in hell I can now and my ex did most of the managerial work anyway. I just started seeing a neurologist and neurosurgeon but surgeon says I don't need a shunt. As much as I'd like to avoid surgery, it seems like a shunt might help me based on my symptoms so now I feel lost on how to improve my condition.\n\n Are any of you on disability for Hydrocephalus? I am trying to get some financial help because I would absolutely be homeless without the support of my loving girlfriend and I don't want to depend on her like this any longer. Besides a shunt, have any lifestyle changes you've made improved your well-being? I've found that simple manual labor such as farming suits me well but I'm worried about handling all the business responsibility should I start my own farm.\n\nSo pretty much, my life is a mess, I'm hanging on by a thread, am losing my dignity and autonomy and this is making me very hopeless and depressed. Have any of you been dealing with these things or know any young adults with similar issues? Sorry to blab on here but I'm very isolated and don't know what else to do. \n\nThank you, \n\nEli\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jc29nx4kvd51.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd0a6ba44ab8ee79e6b8045cf71452336ae5075e", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 637, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Things just aren't working out...", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/i0agtu/things_just_arent_working_out/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "strawberry55555", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wclsl29", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595890157, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/hz2rjn/what_would_you_do/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hz2rjn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/hz2rjn/what_would_you_do/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1595890168, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m feeling so defeated.

week he had violent hiccups that were making him very uncomfortable. he would moan in between each hiccup and as the day progressed the moaning would get worse. around the same time of the onset of hiccups he began to struggle to swallow his drinks and food. we were concerned he may have had a stroke and are still unsure of exactly what is happening. i did some reading and found out that the CNS damage can make the diaphram misbehave and that can cause hiccups.\n\nwe have a doctor coming to see him tomorrow but i have a bit of a tricky situation.  my aunt is my grandfathers main carer and can

haemorrhage at birth 27 years ago. My most recent revisions last year were kind of traumatic. 3 revisions in 8 days followed by the suggestion to drink 2-3 litres of fluid a day plus caffeine, as my shunt was now at too low a pressure but the neuro team couldn't fix it anymore. My brain doesn't get on with the higher pressure valve apparently. \n\nSo that was August last year. I'm now at a point where I'm struggling cognitively (I have SLT and OT input) and I'm getting headaches most days. Pulsing headaches, back pain, feeling of 'pulling' down my spine, vision loss, ringing in my ears. My consultant doesn't think any further surgery is worth doing but also doesn't think there's much evidence for the water/caffeine advice. He says people with shunts just get headaches. So what am I supposed to do? \n\nI'm aiming to get back to full time work and that's not compatible with spending a good chunk of the afternoon lying flat, with my head feeling like it'll explode.

After my revision, the headaches seemed to go away for awhile, but returned about 2 months post op. My shunt was adjusted to the highest (most closed) pressure setting that it is capable of but I am still having headaches.

My third ventricle reduced from 13 mm to 5 mm and the side chambers are also nicely reduced from 21 mm to 17 mm so there is no more to do. Basically im pretty good because i can play tennis im walking a lot im riding bicycle and my thinking is also perfectly fine but.....Im very sensitive to the sun and i am unable to lift things(+15 Kg) without hurting my head. Not a very good feeling.:( Today i went for a walk with the dog and left my hat at home. I thought it wouldnt hurt but it did. The sun shook my head for about 30 minutes and i started to feel the previous symptoms like pressure in my head, dizziness and nausea...I have the same symptoms when i try to lift things like a bigger shopping.

I'm looking to expand beyond the support group structure and would love \"open-source\" feedback -- individual experience to help design group feedback.\n\nPlease take my survey, with no advertising, just questions regarding you or your child's journey with hydrocephalus.

He does think it is the cause of my frequent urination, weakness, and my legs acting up/buckling. He said he wants to monitor things for now (get another brain MRI in six months) and if my symptoms get worse then there will be another lumbar puncture and if surgery is required he said that he would want to do something like a spinal shunt. \n\n\nAnyways, tonight while sitting on the couch watching tv with my boyfriend, the strangest thing happened. We use air purifiers but they are in the corner of the room. My left ear had a whooshing sound similar to the air purifier. Which at first I thought was the air purifier. But then the hearing in my left ear went out completely, I got a pain near my left temple and after I had a high pitched ringing in my left ear (I\u2019m assuming is tinnitus). Then while the tinnitus was continuing a few minutes later the hearing in my left ear came back. Which made me notice the whooshing sound I heard in my ear was not exactly the same whooshing from the air purifier. Then after 10-15 minutes the tinnitus faded away. I\u2019ve never experienced this before. I\u2019ve had random ringing in both of my ears on and off over the years, it would only last like 30 seconds though. This seemed more intense.

I know the settings can be adjusted on the shunt, but my drs seem to think since the fluid build up comes and goes it\u2019s not worth changing the setting.

I understand I\u2019m not as big a priority as emergency hydro patients, but can\u2019t brain damage happen anyway? I\u2019m not projectile vomiting like when I was first dx, but I\u2019m nauseous, have severe head pains, and my cognition and quality of life is getting worse. Phone call follow up in a week but I\u2019ve already been dealing with these symptoms since my ligation surgery 7 weeks ago. \n\n**At what point should a ligation be considered? After something like a shunt tap or other testing and imagery? After how many attempts at finding the right valve settings?** He refused to do shunt tap on me before. He said a ligation was easier than a revision for my symptoms which could\u2019ve been a shunt malfunction, but also my hydrocephalus could\u2019ve been temporary. Now his only tool is a lumbar puncture which was actually painful last time and becoming a small torture to endure. My LPs have borderline high opening rates due to where my tumor+cyst was that lead to hydrocephalus, but he doesn\u2019t believe me or take into consideration the research my previous neurosurgeon (who recently retired) did which confirms pineal cyst/tumor patients experience hydrocephalus at slightly lower rates than most people. I fear if I have another borderline opening pressure he won\u2019t do anything and I\u2019ll slowly decline, and be stuck with complications from the ligation. Why couldn\u2019t he have done other tests before ligating? Maybe I should have pushed harder? I had 4 or 5 adjustments with my first surgeon over the course of 7-8 months, and this new surgeon didn\u2019t want to try any more settings.\n\nThe ligation caused some issues with the incision in my chest, a seroma apparently, which empties and fills almost daily to every 2 or 3 days. I can\u2019t find any info about the nature of my seroma filling and draining *anywhere*. I\u2019m afraid it might actually be CSF, because my body rejected a few stitches, and I was told the *only* stitches they used were to tie off my shunt. Neurosurgeon told me under no circumstance should there be stitches above my skin, told me to go to local ER where they misdiagnosed me and said it wasn\u2019t stitches it was a skin growth, and then told me to see plastic surgery about it. E-mailed neuro pictures where the stitches had actual knots in them. He believed me and told me to go to ER, but I didn\u2019t because it was a shit show the first time and now covid is worse again in my area. And I\u2019m getting really stressed out about all this medical back and forth. The stitches fell off recently and there\u2019s a pokey feeling under my skin. \n\nThis is a new surgeon and I\u2019m a vulnerable person who doesn\u2019t do well with doctors anymore (autistic and now medical ptsd), and **I don\u2019t know if my experience with this new guy is normal in any way.** I advocate for myself but I\u2019m afraid of coming across as argumentative. My family have no idea what I should do or how to support me. I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind out of worry and legit illness impacting my every moment. Is it time for a second opinion? My only other option may be to go out of state, where I only have to go to a city 4 hours away right now.

Has anyone gone through this and gotten relief using Tylenol and what else did you do to lessen the symptoms until you could see your neurologist?\n(I have a Coffman Certas Plus set on 5.)\n\nTIA.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1053, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Malfunction Symptoms?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/rsewc8/malfunction_symptoms/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "trivektor2", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_a8x70u2j", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1640844856, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/rruha4/virusbacteria_and_shunt_infection/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rruha4", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/rruha4/virusbacteria_and_shunt_infection/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1640844866, "score": 1, "selftext": "Can a VP shunt be infected by common virus, bacteria, germs that cause cold, sore throat, ear infection?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1054, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Virus/bacteria and shunt infection", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/rruha4/virusbacteria_and_shunt_infection/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "2in1_Boi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9js6jfib", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1640452819, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/rodl0q/im_scared/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rodl0q", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/rodl0q/im_scared/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1640452829, "score": 1, "selftext": "So my little brother (13) is hospitalized and got a shunt, i'm mostly concerned since he's alone with my mom in city a bit far from here.\n\nI am not certain if he has hydrocephalus or not but from the exams he had it was either a spreading tumor or this, since tumors are shit i hope it is hydrocephalus even if he has to be treated his entire life it'd be better.

I ultimately was diagnosed with chiari malformation type 1, because of the craniosynostosis I had to have an unorthodox surgery to fix it. It was called a skull extraction surgery. Basically three pins were placed and everyday for a month in a half I had to turn them three times a day to slowly pull my skull apart to relieve the pressure being put on my brain and spinal cord. After the pins were removed and I had the surgery to remove the brackets they were attached to I formed a literal hole on the top of my head that would not heal, on top of that I was having CSF fluid building up in the space where the skull was pulled apart and was just putting the pressure back on my brain. Fast forward 2 years later 5 more surgeries, 3 different picc lines and a lot of stress, they diagnosed hydrocephalus and placed a VP shunt and closed up the open hole. Now I am in recovery and still having fluid build up! It is extremely frustrating and I\u2019m to the point where idk if I will ever have a \u201cnormal\u201d life. I\u2019m praying it is a matter of adjusting the shunt, but it is already set on a pretty opened up setting. Just done with all of this already.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1039, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Need to vent to ears that understand.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/rf019s/need_to_vent_to_ears_that_understand/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Weather-woman-", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_e2cc4j6d", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1639268155, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/rechh6/shunt_infection/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rechh6", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/rechh6/shunt_infection/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1639268166, "score": 1, "selftext": "Has anyone had a shunt infection?

"Our two year old daughter has a shunt, and for the past three months she has been vomiting in the night. We called out neurosurgeon right when it started and told them we were pretty sure it was shunt malfunction. They told us there's no way, and that we need to see our pediatrician. For three months, we tried troubleshooting it with our pediatrician and messaging our neurosurgeon with updates and questions. A week ago, we begged and we finally convinced them to give us an appointment. They checked the shunt pressure and said everything was fine. We asked if we could do an MRI, and they said it wasn't necessary. Then yesterday, after months of no sleep and vomiting, we brought her to the emergency room and the neurosurgeon there spent an hour to take x-rays and MRI, and knew 100 percent that it was shunt malfunction and we were able to get her surgery.\n\nLooking back, I'm beating myself up for not going to another neurosurgeon for a second opinion right away.

I\u2019ve had multiple shunt adjustments, all of which only brought a few weeks of relief from my headache and neurological symptoms. I was alerted to a shunt recall of my shunt, which I\u2019m still confused about whether or not has impacted my symptoms. I\u2019m now seeing a second neurosurgeon as the first who dx me and placed the shunt retired, right around the time I was alerted to the recall. \n\nThe new surgeon has specialized in shunts for 30 years, yet doesn\u2019t acknowledge or seem to believe a key piece of knowledge about my hydrocephalus that previous surgeon imparted on me. He was a specialist with pineal cysts and tumors, and has said the research and experience of his patients shows that we experience hydrocephalus at lower opening pressures than most people. My new surgeon is contesting my hydrocephalus, suggesting I never had it in the first place and that it\u2019s idiopathic intracranial hypertension instead. Regardless of that, which he says is merely semantics, he\u2019s suggesting that either the shunt was a temporary measure or it\u2019s malfunctioned according to the recall. \n\nI went with his least invasive option, trying a shunt ligation, instead of a complete revision because he said if he decides the shunt and I still have the symptoms then I\u2019d still need a ligation\u2026. A third lumbar puncture, and another surgery which is far more painful than I was told, I\u2019m sitting with the same headache I had pre-op except it\u2019s not positional anymore, which is just like my symptoms before the shunt was placed. My chest (where the ligation was done a week ago) feels like it\u2019ll crack open, the tubing is tighter and restricts my movements more than ever, it hurts all along the tubing and where it goes into my head, I can\u2019t seem to stop hunching over when I\u2019m upright, I walk like an elderly person, I still have the same neurological symptoms as before, I can\u2019t seem to see straight and my eyes feel like they\u2019re being forced to go cross eyed at times. \n\nI\u2019m getting the stitches out in 2 days where I won\u2019t even get to see the surgeon but his NP who I\u2019ve never met. I didn\u2019t get to see the surgeon after my surgery (while lucid- he visited me apparently while I was still under anesthesia) to discuss symptoms that indicate an emergency/ returning hydrocephalus. Once again I\u2019m posting here, sad about my journey and all of the pain, and overwhelmed about not knowing what\u2019s going to happen to me\u2026 and doubting the neurosurgeon despite his very nice and patient demeanor with my \u201ccomplex\u201d case.

The only time it has gone away is for a couple weeks after the couple revisions I have had. My surgeon says maybe this is just because of the drugs I am on after surgery but I know that isn't true, because after I had an ETV, I did not feel any relief like with shunt revisions, despite being on the same \"drugs\" during / after surgery. My case is as follows: \n\n**2009:** First revision since birth,  first shunt lasted quite a while. Installed programmable shunt with no anti siphon device. \n\n**2015:** headaches began and eventually stayed. During this time I grew a lot and I believe I was over draining constantly since I grew tall and my shunt had no anti siphon device. \n\n**2015-2019:** Countless ER visits hoping they'd find something, ventricles always slit like. Valve would always be at a different setting. For some reason they never thought during this period that maybe the valve was broken and I was over draining, they always assumed it was just at the wrong setting and would send me home. \n\n**July 2019:** Woke up one morning with an extremely sharp pain when getting up from bed. ER confirmed ventricles had finally gotten bigger and were no longer slit like. Had a revision, for some reason, surgeon did not include anti siphon device.\n\n\\-After this surgery I had probably 20 adjustments. None helped. Turning it too high would cause a much worse headache, but I still had a constant baseline headache. \n\n**March 2020:** Shunt failed, again I felt an extremely sharp pain when rising. Shunt was revised, moved to the top of my head (was previously behind my ear) and anti siphon device was added. \n\n\\-After this surgery I again had probably 20 adjustments. None helped. Turning it too high would cause a much worse headache, but I still had a constant baseline headache. \n\n**March 2021:** ETV performed, shunt turned \"off\". Despite surgeon saying I had a 90% success score, it failed 2 weeks later pretty rapidly. It was really bad. Luckily my shunt was just \"turned off\" and they turned it back on and I was ok, back to my baseline headache.\n\n**March 2021 Post ETV** **- now.** My shunt works, they turn it up and my ventricles get bigger, turn it down and they get smaller, it's just like there is no \"right\" setting for me. My surgeon thinks the headache is a migraine. I've seen neurology after every surgery and tried so many things, and none have touched my headache at all. The only relief I have felt in the past 5-6 years is after shunt revisions for a couple weeks. I think it is because pressure is relieved but I really don't know what that means exactly. If anyone suffers similarly to me, or has in the past, have you found anything that has helped? I am feeling truly hopeless at this point, my neurologist doesn't know what to do, surgeon thinks it isn't related to my shunt, and even a second opinion surgeon said basically the same thing. I more than anything want to stop suffering, and unsure what route to take. \n\nI am wondering if my headache is some sort of shunt-related headache. My shunt is working for sure, but I am beginning to think that this headache I have may be caused by changes in my brain caused by years of continuous over draining.

I saw my neurologist earlier this week and discussed everything I'm experiencing with her and she ordered a CT to check etv function (waiting on order to go through)... anyway:\nRecently I have have had a range of my normal symptoms and some new chaos happening recently and will divide it into categories and you tell me if you have experienced anything similar?\n+Migraine that doesn't respond to meds for very long (like abortive meds that usually get rid of it completely only work for 30 min then it's like I never took meds, happened earlier this year too)\n+Heavy head (common)\n+Sleeping is all I want to do (happened earlier this year)\n+moving head makes me nausea/dizzy (severity of earlier this year)\n+intermittent vision change (eyes see different colors, brand new)\n+Pain closing R eye (common with my migraines)\n+sleeping on back/ Right side = feel like I'm hanging upside down (slightly elevated is most comfortable) (common)\n+Slightly tacky at neuro appt (brand new)\n+stiff neck (brand new when accompanied with headache)\n+pain touching R half of head/ etv reservoir (happened earlier this year)\n+hormone changes? (New)\nAny advice? What have you experienced? Do symptoms change between your revisions?

The fourth ventricle prominence made me think for a moment, considering that this language, to my basic knowledge, indiciates hydrocephalus might be present, or that maybe this should be looked into further.  \n\nDue to this, I spoke to my neurologist, who told me there is nothing to worry about. It made me  skeptical considering the symptoms I've been dealing with are in alignment with hydrocephalus, and have been increasing in severity. \n\n\\----------\n\nApparently these are the common symptoms, and I am experiencing all of them now, having to adjust my employment, education and social life due to them: \n\n\\- Headaches: especially after work or after participating in conversation. Bright lights, movement, and sounds are uncomfortable. Conversations, the sound of people talking, can sound like nails on a chalkboard sometimes. \n\nDifficulty Initation Movements: Yes, sometimes I command myself to move, and it's like my whole body is falling behind, almost freezing up. I think my manager at work is aware of this. \n\nChanges is vision: My focus goes in and out, like a camera, from blur to focus, constantly. \n\n\\- Breathing issues\n\n\\-Difficulty focusing: I can't even express how hard it is getting, day by day to focus on small tasks. \n\n\\-Unsteady walk: Vertigo and losing my balance is becoming a constant. Some days better than others. \n\n\\-Irrritability: Very on-edge on a daily basis, over the smallest things. This isn't in my character, but so many things bug me, simply for being in my presence. \n\n\\- Drowsiness: It is a constant. I do not drink alcohol, and drink about 2 coffees/day to keep me awake. \n\n\\-Changes in personality and behavior: the most prominent aspect. I am angry, depressed and have difficulty focusing on my thoughts. \n\nBladder Control Problems: Yes I go to the bathroom all the time, even if it's just a little urine. \n\n\\- Think I am developing dystonia on my face, along with constant cramps in hands and feet. \n\n\\-----------\n\nWhat are your thoughts on all of this?\n\nShould I investigate the fourth ventricle situation further, with a different neurologist?\n\nPlease let me know.

It tickles and it's wet, not after showering or anything. Which caused me to Google, why is there fluid in my ear. a few sites suggested Hydrocephalus which led me down the rabbit hole. \n\nUsually I'd ignore the Google results but it started to make sense and I'd like your opinions before I see an expensive doctor (USA).\n\nIt started when I was diagnosed with diplopia caused by a forth nerve palsy in my right eye a few year ago, out of the blue, I woke up and couldn't see straight. it resolved itself after 2 weeks with residual effects but doctors were puzzled, no brain injury no tumor. In the MRI they found I had an enlarged brain ventricle, just one, the right side (of the MRI so idk if it's a reverse image). The neurologist said it's fine and not to worry. I took his advice because he was out of network and I couldn't afford to follow up anyway.\n\nFast forward to now... I've always walked funny, and stairs are fun, hard to see the last couple steps. I walk a little staggered, can't really walk in a straight line too well. I've never been able to follow the words in a book and end up reading the same line a few times before I find my place. A lot of this is related to diplopia.

He had a spinal tumor removed through cervical spine surgery two years ago. Couple of years later he had many complications including a difficulty swallowing.\n\nIt turns out that this was caused by the hardware implantation during spine surgery which caused many secondary complications. He had another reconstructive surgery where they removed the plate. His recovery after this was not smooth and he had infections for several days.\n\nThe doctors are now saying he has hydrocephalus. Now they are recommending shunt surgery. My friend' is finally making significant progress and is able to walk on his own. They do not want the surgery if it is an option.Added to that he has no symptoms related to hydrocephalus. The hydrocephalus diagnosis was based on one CT scan of the brain with the second scan showing no worsening. No follow up tests have been done such as lumbar drainage or lumbar infusion test. When the neurosurgeon was asked if his progression is getting worse or the same he said it is not getting worse.Any general thoughts on the following questions from someone knowledgeable are appreciated.\n\n1. If he is largely asymptomatic with respect to hydrocephalus and the evidence is only a single CT scan, shouldn't other tests be conducted before recommending shunt surgery\n2. If the patient is largely asymptomatic, what is the risk associated with waiting to see if the symptoms progress for the worse?\n3. I have read ETV as another alternative for the shunt procedure which is less invasive? Is this recommended? The specific neurosurgeon is only giving shunt surgery as an option and nothing else.\n\nAttaching ct scan results from before and after dated Sep 2 and October

Born with hydrocephalus, it grossly failed in 2009 at age 11/12. Codman programmable shunt was put in, and all was good up until about 3 years ago. Since then, I\u2019ve developed headaches that have become more and more common, and for the last year, they have been non stop 24/7. I\u2019ve had so many cat scans, all \u201cnormal, no evidence of hydrocephalus, slit like ventricles\u201d etc. they\u2019ve changed the setting, but ventricles don\u2019t budge and headache doesn\u2019t go away. That being said, the headaches are bearable...they aren\u2019t horrible, but they are constant. Neurosurgeons aren\u2019t sure what to say, one thinks it is either \u201cpartially working, or I\u2019m not shunt dependent\u201d.  I have no papilidema (not sure if i spelt that right) no mental disturbance, etc. only the headache. It\u2019s been like this for years. Surgeons are quick to say \u201cjust a headache, unlikely due to shunt if you ONLY have a headache\u201d  I\u2019ve had it adjusted, nothing. Even when it\u2019s set at 200 or at 0, I feel the same, just a headache. I\u2019ve had them every day for 3+ years, they\u2019ve gotten slightly worse but not by much. Imaging (CT, shunt series, etc.) all looks the same from the past 3 years. Seen 3 different neurosurgeons at UCLA. \n\nIt is extremely scary, I am pretty scared and maybe this thought is not logical since I\u2019ve had the headaches for 3+ years, but every day I am scared the pressures just gonna build up to some point one day and kill me, or cause coma, or something serious. If I COULD just live with the slit ventricles and treat them with migraine meds, I would since they aren\u2019t horrible, but I have trouble understanding whether or not it can be simply \u201clived with\u201d since I don\u2019t and haven\u2019t had any other symptoms for the 3+ years I\u2019ve had headaches. Curious if anyone else has slit like ventricles, SVS, a similar story to mine, or treatment of slit ventricles with migraine therapy.  The worry and the stress of thinking I\u2019m going to just drop dead is 10 times worse than the actual headaches.

I've had a few scares when I would have pain and rush to the neuro to get it checked. Each time he told me everything was fine. 3 years ago I had an MRI done and he said that my shunt looked great but my tube broke and calcified. So technically, my shunt hasn't worked for 3 years. He thinks I don't need it and has been wanting to take it out. I'd rather keep it since I dislike surgery and it doesn't bother me too much. For the past 3 days though, The back of my head where the shunt is placed has been aching. As well as a tightness in my neck where the tube runs down.

She has had hydrocephalus since birth and she was part of the \"first generation\" of babies to receive shunts. I became used to hospitals growing up because of all the surgeries she had. She was a great mom in her own way. When I was in kindergarten, she would yell to me in the kitchen how to make a PB&amp;J during the time she was bed ridden. The amount of pain she deals with is amazing. One thing I have been working through is needing to be the \"sickest\" in my house. I am married and have an amazing husband but I have a natural tendency to want to be \"sicker\" than him if we are both dealing with something at the same time. And I know it comes from my mother always downplaying my sickness and needing to be sickest when I was younger. If I had a headache or stomachache or anything, she would let my dad and I know that she was doing worse (which of course she was, she has hydrocephalus and had regular migraines) My dad would allow me to just go to my room and feel bad by myself because my mother needed that attention (which was the best option in the situation I think). It may not have been a big deal but did skew my mentality that if I am not the \"sickest,\" my pain doesnt count. My husband is great and has helped me work through this but it still sometimes comes out-we can joke about it now. I have distance from the situation and I love my parents and I know we all have our idiosyncrasies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestion: do any of you with hydrocephalus have a need to be the \"sickest\" or be vocal about your pain when others are expressing theirs even if it is unrelated?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 395, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Mother Has Hydrocephalus--This may seem insensitive but is honest", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563669310, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/cffknl/my_mother_has_hydrocephalusthis_may_seem/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Experimentalphone", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_24o20tpg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563032144, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ccqner/cant_find_any_medical_guidelines_for_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ccqner", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ccqner/cant_find_any_medical_guidelines_for_the/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563032146, "score": 3, "selftext": "I have searched online for weeks but I can't seem to find ANY medical guidelines for the diagnosis and management/treatment of hydrocephalus in general for adults. \n\nUsually organizations like NICE provide detailed comprehensive guidelines on most diseases.

We got pregnant again and this time a boy (my joy!). Everything was going well and looking good. Wife's BO then started trending higher and we were talking with her OB Dr about inducing. They scheduled a Biophysical to check everything was alright to deliver. He passed that no problem. Wife and I left to go home and got a call back from the Dr saying \"yea we need you to go to this hospital and have a level 2 ultrasound done. Your son has fluid in his brain\". We jumped in the car and took up.. the whole way thinking \"what the hell is going to happen\".  We got the ultrasound done and my wife being a nurse noticed he had what looked like an blood clot or something and his brain didn't look right.. met with the Dr at the hospital and was basically told he may die at birth 30%, or be born with a 90% chance of being intellectually challenged.. his head was large and they didn't recommend vaginal delivery, they wanted to keep him in for at least 2 more weeks and just monitor Wife's BP.  We then transfered everything over to Abbot Children's Hospital and started a day with meeting with different Drs and such to go over things with wife and baby. Wife had her appointment and her BP was staying high and the nurses and Drs came in and said \"were having baby today\". This was a week after our unfortunate news. Scared and worried we waited for everything to line up for a C-SECTION. Our son was born that night, looking normal other than he is a big boy, long and his head wasn't very large at birth. This week we've meet with a few neurologist to go over plans for our boy. His head hasn't grown much but a little and they have watched the pressure in his head.. they say he has sings of building pressure in his head, jittery, sleepy, temps up and down. He's been eating some via bottle and the rest via tube. He was off oxygen and then put back on because he was resetting a little. We have surgery scheduled for Monday. It's just hard seeing your little one like this and surgery is a bit concerning especially him being only  a week old. They're going to put in a shunt for him, they don't see any reason for developmental issues as his brain tissue looks good.\n\nJust wanted to share our story and maybe get some advice from anyone here. \n\nTL;DNR.

I had trouble waking up and have noticed changes in my sleeping patterns. I've been noticing that my vision is blurred. I have shooting pains in my shunt, and a mild fever/headache that is worse on the side that the shunt is on. I am also very drowsy and have a hard time paying attention to things. \n\nI've only had two incidents where my shunt was infected or having problems in my life (once when I was 4, and again when I was around 13).

Over the years I have gotten extensions as I grew.  My last surgery was when I was 15.  I am now 29 and for the past year and a half or so I commonly woke up to migraines that Tylenol didn't seem to help with at all.  However most of the time by the evening they would subside and I could at least have a pain free evening.  I didn't bother going to the doctor since every time I went to the doctor in the past it turned up nothing and I end up feeling like a hypochondriac and wasting a couple hundred dollars on a doc visit I didn't need.  But back on the 7th I had the mother of all migraines.  It felt like my eyes were going to explode out of my head so I went to the nurse and she set up an appointment with the doctor to get some xrays done and turns out a simple trip to the doctor to get some prescriptions for migraines ended up in me getting sent to surgery to get my shunt fixed.  The surgeons removed most of my 29 year old shunt and replaced it with a whole new one from my understanding.  They couldn't get the old one completely out because it was fused with tissue in my chest or something so now I have 1 and a half shunts.  the surgery was on the 7th and I am recovering nicely.  Still feels a little painful to walk around with 3 incisions (1 on my stomach, 1 on my neck and one on the side of my head).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to say it's a relief finally biting the bullet and figuring out what was wrong with me.  The whole ordeal took me by surprise thinking I would just go get a prescription and be done with it only to get rushed into surgery and having to take a few weeks to recover.  I'm glad the shunt was the problem because there's an obvious solution to that problem. Otherwise I would still be in the dark as to what has been causing these migraines for over a year.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 333, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What a relief", "updated_utc": 1553212300, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/as4a9t/what_a_relief/"}, {"author": "texican1997", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2unyy3s", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1550531436, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/as3e8k/infection/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "as3e8k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/as3e8k/infection/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1550531437, "score": 1, "selftext": "Ok so I don't have an infection on any of my incision but what does it look like?

Excuse my language but that\u2019s how I feel. \n\n\nI need some input from parents that have had babies with bacterial meningitis that caused enlarged ventricles and subsequent hydrocephalus. \n\n\nThey say my son\u2019s hydro is obstructive and non communicative.  He has just finished his 6 week course of antibiotics for his e. Coli meningitis. CSF cultures and mri show he is clear of his infection. But mri does show a narrowing of the aqueduct and swollen ventricles. His FOC is 30cm and grows 0cm to .5cm a day.   \n\n\nHe is 70 days old born 25+4. So he\u2019s 35+4 now and 10 weeks old. He is clinically doing so well. No issues with feeds. PDA closed on its own. Gaining weight and is currently 1800g almost 4lbs. \n\n\nHe was intubated and then on cpap and then high flow of 6 for a week and then moved from high flow of 4 then to 3 in less than a week. He\u2019s currently on high flow of 3 and 21% oxygen. No As and Bs for 5 days then he had 1 two days in a row after they moved him to the flow of 3, 2 days ago. They had to put him on the flow of 2 for his MRI and because he did so well they trialed him on that after his MRI. He didn\u2019t tolerate so they put him on the flow of 3.   \n\n\nNo seizures. No brain bleeds. Very active, strong, feisty, and alert during cares and holds. Has zone 2 (previously zone 1 but has improved) stage 2 ROP as of Monday and has eye exams every week.   \n\n\nThey want to do surgery on Monday because even though he is doing well clinically, his FOC is getting bigger and his fontanelle is full and he\u2019s showing some veins in his scalp. But it\u2019s not bad enough that they would do the surgery yesterday or this week even.   \n\n\nThe first neurologist we met said we could do VP shunt or ETV. Then today\u2019s neurologist said her boss (who I haven\u2019t met) said they\u2019d likely do a VP shunt based on the \u201cscoring system\u201d they used with my son\u2019s stats.   \n\n\nThey haven\u2019t tried spinal taps. It was never even discussed but I read about that being an option that works for others when I searched on this group. Should I push for that? Or should I push for ETV before a shunt? The doctor today said ETV could be possible, he definitely fits the criteria, but I\u2019d have to really push for it.   \n\n\nAlso, if you\u2019ve gone through this already, how is your child doing? Are they neuro-typical for the most part or do they have a lot of disabilities? Did you run into a lot of failures and operations? I\u2019m thinking about requesting an actual sit down with his whole team so we can discuss this. Since his teams have changed I feel like the new doctors aren\u2019t as invested in this case and are very hands off and flippant and I don\u2019t like the feeling that my son is just another number to them.   \n\n\nOur previous team would show me his imaging and go over things with me. Whereas as of recent, I haven\u2019t even been shown his most recent MRI and that\u2019s after the attending said she would show me! Our last resident would call me with results or come by in person but now I have to really nag them to tell me anything and they move so slow!

I am coming to you all as a s/o of someone who has been diagnosed with hydrocephalus. We live in San Diego, and we are having such a hard time gettig answers from doctors. \n\nMy s/o was diagnosed in July of this year (2018) and had a VP Shunt placed. Consequently, he cannot work or drive. Since then, things have been getting more and more difficult. It seems no doctor has any answers for us about pretty much anything. He is under emergency medi-cal, and the hospital that he had to have the immediate surgery in does not accept medi-cal for any follow up appointments, so we\u2019ve had to find a different clinic for him to go to. Recently, we had an appointment with the top neurosurgeon at a prestigeous hospital, where we were told he reviewed my s/o\u2019s case and wanted to speak with him directly. We waited over a month and turned down sooner appointments because we thought he would be able to help us more. \n\nAt the appointment, the doctor had no information on my s/o. He didn\u2019t even know he had the surgery, and was surprised to learn that. My s/o has had what he thought were seizures before, but this doctor tells us they don\u2019t sound like seizures and even looks unpleasantly surprised when he is told my s/o went through the surgery. \n\nHe then proceeds to tell my boyfriend that he still will be unable to work and drive for the next couple months and he ordered a EEG and a CAT scan for my s/o. At this point, no doctor has given us any answers on why my s/o gets headaches, if they\u2019re normal, where he\u2019s supposed to be innrecovery, how his brain looks now, it\u2019s very frustrating. I can\u2019t find a single doctor in the area who can help us. He needs a job. He has no money. What can we do?? Please help us, advice, kind words, anything. Feel free to ask for more details.

About a week or so before I was scheduled to have a shunt put in they did another head CT and told my parents that it appeared the excess fluid just vanished and they had no idea what happened to it. \n\n So my first question, can the fluid just kind of clear up on its own without any type of intervention? My reason for asking this is all throughout my life I have suffered with immense headaches and extreme nausea.  I had to go through speech therapy because I had difficulty with certain sounds. \n\nI am now 40 years old and I am looking back throughout my life trying to make sense of things. My husband recently passed away in December and he was adamant that I still suffered from hydro. I am tired all the time. I will mix up simple words, even mispronounce words that aren't even difficult. It will sometimes take me 3 or 4 tries just to get the easiest word out or I will skip it completely.  My vision is becoming worse and things are becoming more blurred. Even now when editing this post it is extremely hard to do because things are blurred together. I still get nausea for no reason, light headed and migraines that at times will put me in the ER. I sometimes have difficulty talking and will slur my speech. Tonight I was talking with my daughter about me being tested and was slurring words. Even she noticed it and said something. My daughter is 9! There are also times where my arms just feel off. It's hard to explain.\n\nEver since getting covid my migraines have gotten even worse. Normally I can just wait them out (there are few that I can't) but in March I was at the hospital. My son woke up to me vomiting in the bathroom and was worried about me. I realized I needed to get checked out. They recommended I follow up with my PCP to see about starting medication to prevent the migraines. \n\nMy PCP was since left so I saw the new NP. She has OCD which is a good thing. She scheduled me for an MRI based upon my passed history and the other complaints. I am waiting for insurance to give approval. \n\nSo the next question is; is it possible that it's been there the whole time? Could the scan maybe have not been clear cause as a small child I was moving around too much?\n\nWhat can I expect moving forward if they do find something? I am so worried about having to have surgery as I am now a single mom of 2  and can't really be down and for long. Also, my father developed hydrocephalus after having a tumor removed and he fell and hit his head the night after surgery. He had a shunt put in and it caused so many other complications. \n\nAnd is it possible to be genetic? My son who is 10 has been complaining about headaches recently. He didn't start talking till he was almost 3 and has been in speech till he graduated this past Jan. He has poor academics and a lack of focus. He claims that things blur together. He was diagnosed with ADHD-I, but reading up on symptoms for kids it seems that he could cross off some of those boxes. His ped did also order a head ct for him just to make sure everything is clear, because I am always paranoid as a parent. \n\nI know what it's like to be told your headaches are nothing and just made up in your head.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 861, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I have a few questions and was hoping to get some answers.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/msh907/i_have_a_few_questions_and_was_hoping_to_get_some/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "kcscheiernwhite", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7tb0o596", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1618512360, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/mrl7mv/23_weeks_pregnant_and_scared/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mrl7mv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/mrl7mv/23_weeks_pregnant_and_scared/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1618512371, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey everyone, new here. I am 23 weeks pregnant and my baby was diagnosed with Hydrocephalus and an under developed cerebellum. I have a daughter who is about to be 2 and this is all so scary for me.

That maybe once the baby is born they will put a shunt in and see if that helps the cerebellum go back to normal size.

I'm a mum to a 17yr old daughter who got diagnosed with a non-malignant brain tumour on January 6th this year, and as a result has severe hydrocephalus.

I am really worried she won't be able to cope with the workload and walking to and from campus (she lives in Halls about 10 hilly minutes away) when she's only just had it done.

Of course my surgeon said it's just a matter of finding the right setting... but after trying all the settings, none helped, going too high gave me an under drainage headache, and too low gave me a constant low grade pressure feeling, we couldn't find the middle ground. Then a year later he tried to revise it again and add an anti siphon device... same thing happened... small ventricles (unless they turned it to a high setting)... constant headache... etc. He told me I was a candidate for an ETV because I have aqueductal stenosis, and I had it done a couple months ago. I felt some relief with the ETV, my headache was better, but still there, unfortunately it failed after 2 weeks and they had to turn my shunt back on... as soon as they did that, the constant headache returned and here I am again. Also, during my ETV they left my shunt in and tested it, they said it worked great and there was no issue with it. \n\nI'm 23 and I am miserable living like this, I have a pressure feeling \"headache\" in my head 24/7.

For the past five or so years her gait has changed. Intially she began to noticeably shuffle her feet and take shorter steps. Then occasionally she would be walking and not be able to stop herself until she grabbed onto something. She had a couple falls so I took her to the doctor and did an MRI and some other tests. I remember they mentioned that the ventricles are slightly enlarged but never mentioned it again.\n\nThey diagnosed her with vascular parkinsonism and prescribed her medication for Parkinsons. It didn't help and her symptoms have slowly progressed. She probably has some level of cognitive issues but it's hard to say whether that is due to age or a disease. She also occasionally can't make it to the bathroom in time, maybe like once or twice a month.\n\nI only recently became aware of NPH and we have an appointment with a neurosurgeon this week. I am bringing her MRIs for him to observe.\n\nI'm still kind of researching the condition but I'm wondering what we should expect from the appointment?\n\nI have read in some cases doctors say that it is better to treat it as quickly as possible to ensure the best outcome. So I'm wondering if it is too late for her now. But I have read other doctors say that you should be in a wheelchair and in diapers before you start thinking about shunt surgery, I guess because of the risks involved.\n\nWould appreciate any thoughts or questions to ask the doctor as I am no authority on this topic.\n\nAlso if anyone who has it lives in Ontario pls let me know!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 830, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I think my Mom has NPH - looking for advice", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ltss5m/i_think_my_mom_has_nph_looking_for_advice/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1614445383, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "edited": 1614445714, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ltscta/i_think_my_mom_has_it_looking_for_advice/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ltscta", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ltscta/i_think_my_mom_has_it_looking_for_advice/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "removed_by_category": "deleted", "retrieved_on": 1614519261, "score": 1, "selftext": "[deleted]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 830, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "I think my Mom has it.

I also had a rash all over my legs and breathlessness.\n\nThese symptoms lasted the entire weekend, meaning I had been unable to eat anything for three days. This really set me back.

I had a MAJOR migraine last year that lasted five days and was probably viral meningitis. I didn't go to the hospital for stupid and regrettable reasons but I'm still having problems that should have resolved by now. My primary physician deduced that it was viral meningitis and none of my imaging has shown otherwise (ct's, mri, mra- I have a tiny cerebral outpouching but no evidence of a hemorrhage of any kind).\n\nSymptoms: horrible cognitive \"deficits\". I functioned normally on a neuropsych exam but my personality has changed and I don't feel the same physically or mentally as I did before my migraine. I'm more impulsive and have less of a filter. Constant sensation of dullness and dumbness unlike anything I've experienced before. \"Cranial\" nausea and a sense of high pressure in my head/brain. Unbearable sense of being inflamed in my head, to the point where I'm surprised I can communicate properly sometimes. This has been highly noticeable for the past month and a half but present since the presumptive meningitis last year. It seems to come and go throughout the day but never goes away. Alcohol effects me strongly and weed/cbd make me highly aware of the pressure sensation and increases the sense of cognitive deficit dramatically. I'm barely drinking and smoking at the moment because of this. Drowsiness, mental malaise. The pressure feels like how people describe rebound intracranial pressure problems.\n\nSymptoms I don't have: major balance problems (I have minor moments where I kind of tip over due to hypermobility), major gait problems, incontinence.\n\nI feel generally dazed and am unable to focus on anything. My behavior has changed a bit to the point where my relationships are suffering as a result. I've had concussions in the past but the meningitis* seemed to be the cognitive straw on the camel's back. My thought is that I may have developed some form of hydrocephalus during the meningitis? It's possible that my brain was damaged during the ordeal but I really don't feel as if the physical issues have completely resolved.\n\nIs it possible to have hydrocephalus without having the major outward symptoms?

Did you shave your whole head?\n\nI\u2019m 2 1/2 weeks post op, my stitches are out, and I still don\u2019t know if I should shave the rest of my hair off or not. I\u2019ve struggled with caring properly for my long, frizzy, wavy curly hair my whole life, but despite that my hair was important to me bc of my culture and the fact that it was a barrier between me and the world. And then I had surgery last year for a cyst removal where a large portion of the hair on the back of my head was shaved. Ever since then I\u2019ve had massive self esteem problems related to hair, despite the fact that I was able to hide it the surgery site with ponytails until my new hair grew in. When the new growth was 3 1/2 inches long I cut the rest of my hair to match the length, but longer on the top for a feminine kind of look. I got used to having short hair for the first time in my life, and the look was starting to grow on me, but I didn\u2019t get the chance to learn to love it.\n\nNow, on the right half of my head I have the hair shaved back about 4 inches, going down in a curved manner all the way to the right side of the nape of my neck. The shunt device is an inch back from my hairline above my right eyebrow and is very visible. The incision is also still pretty thick and raised. I fear if I shave my hair and go without a head covering that it will be super obvious and get me stares. I\u2019m really self conscious even around my family. Right now when I leave the house (very little trips out in public, but I have to walk my dog every day) I\u2019ve been wearing a hat or a scarf sometimes, but the scarf doesn\u2019t stay on very well. It would be easier for overall hair care and growth to shave my head but I still have reservations. I just feel so low about how I look now, and I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll take for the hair to grow enough to hide the large lump the device makes. I hate wearing hats and scarves too, but wigs aren\u2019t an option because of sensory issues. \n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do and would love to hear what others decided to do with their hair, if y\u2019all went out the house with your head uncovered before your hair hid the shunt device or not, how long it took for your hair to grow in over the device, etc.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 822, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "First shunt, 2 1/2 wks post-op hair cut indecision.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ljw69e/first_shunt_2_12_wks_postop_hair_cut_indecision/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "rondog469", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_d2w3g", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1613271820, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ljfvv4/my_4_month_old_just_had_etv_surgery/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ljfvv4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ljfvv4/my_4_month_old_just_had_etv_surgery/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1613271831, "score": 1, "selftext": "Our little man had hydrocephalus, head getting larger, eyes gazing downward (sun setting eyes)...anyway that surgery was Wednesday.

Living in A rural small town in Massachusetts attending community college. I live at home with my parents. My parents knew that I might go to college and not finish because of two disabilities I have had practically since utero including a brain injury. I barely got through high school. I was in special education my whole school \u201ccareer\u201d. I\u2019m not dumb... I just have a lot of challenges. Anyways my school has certain rules set by the state of what classes I have to take for an associates degree. This includes 3 pre-college level math and science classes which I cannot pass for the life of me even after attending lots of tutoring up to 5 days a week.  Also I have only been taking 2 classes a semester and I\u2019ve been going almost 3 years. I\u2019m about 40 credits in of the 65-70 I need. \n\n\nMy dream career is a radio dj. This used to be a profession that you could complete without a degree but I have been told that corporately owned Stations prefer a degree. They also have very limited internship possibilities. I got one small one when I was 16 through a vocational rehab program for people with disabilities but I aged out at 18. While I\u2019m still attending school I\u2019m going to apply for summer internships in the media and communications fields but who knows if I can get any. I\u2019m just not sure how I can accomplish this without college. I know I don\u2019t NEED college but In all the circles I\u2019ve been in they said it\u2019s highly recommended. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nNow of course, we are in the middle of a pandemic. My school says they don\u2019t think they will open back up in person for at least two semesters. So I am stuck with what I can do. \nSo my parents and I think I\u2019ll have to drop out or not return. My credits are good for up to 10 years.

It came as a shock if I\u2019m being honest, I was the passenger in a nasty car accident the February before and was extremely lucky. I had bruising to my knees and whiplash but that was all. Two weeks later I started fainting, not losing consciousness entirely, but mostly the room would spin, my head would feel heavy, body disoriented and I would often fall down. I have no history of headaches, migraines or fainting before this accident- other than when iron levels were low but I knew this was different. My GP diagnosed me with anaemia (which I already had and took supplements for). I was reluctant to pursue further out of fear of what could be wrong. I often overthink so I just trusted my GP and told myself it would be ok. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t ok. The day I called NHS 111 I was at University in my third year of my degree. It was 7 months after my accident and 1 month after my 21st birthday. I lost sight in one eye and feeling of my left side. I fainted more than 60 times that day. I also had other various side effects like vomiting, heaviness behind my eyes and in my neck. After 24 hrs in a&amp;e for a \u2018headache\u2019 I received the news and was sent to St George\u2019s the next day for diagnosis and treatment. \n\nI\u2019ve found it really hard knowing I\u2019ve randomly got this shunt in my body and there\u2019s no real cure. While I\u2019m incredibly lucky in the fact I\u2019ve only had the one surgery, managed to live semi-normally afterwards and still achieve a 2:1 in my degree- I suffer greatly from Chronic Migraines due to the trauma of the neurosurgery. I also have had fluctuating hormones and weight changes since surgery. I was told not to eat before the surgery which took days to happen due to other emergencies occurring in the hospital at the same time. Because of this, I left hospital at 7st 5-8lb (the skinniest and most unhealthy I\u2019ve ever been). Also, due to the pandemic I\u2019ve also really not been given any clear advice about my health condition and it makes me feel very isolated. \n\nIve been told the swelling/fluid build up was caused by the car accident yet another neurologist claims it is congenital. Ive been told that there is a blockage in my spinal cord and brain but test results do not indicate it to be anything serious. They described it to be membrane blocking the fluid from normally draining down my spine ??? I\u2019ve been told that the brain swelling may have been there for years and may have concealed my migraines. That the new low pressure has made the symptoms more noticeable. I feel that most of this information is very conflicting. \n\nAll in all, I take strong meds for the migraines and I am in chronic pain most weeks. It can be quite scary as these symptoms feel often very similar to the initial symptoms of hydrocephalus (pre-op).\n\nDoes anyone have similar symptoms/diagnosis? I haven\u2019t met anyone yet who has gone through this and more specifically got a diagnosis in adulthood. It would be nice to share thoughts/experiences. \n\nTLDR\nNeurosurgeons diagnosed me with hydrocephalus after extensive testing in St George\u2019s in early adulthood and since my brain surgery I have suffered with chronic migraines, hormonal/weight changes (mostly losing lots of weight and I am only 5\u201d4 8st 3lb).

I have had hydrocephalus since birth. It was discovered when I had been experiencing a cold for two weeks and my mother had a feeling that something was wrong. I then had an operation at 5 months old to insert a shunt. I haven\u2019t had many problems since then (I have been very lucky). I was discharged from the children\u2019s hospital when I was 13/14 after an MRI scan of my head that I would have yearly to monitor my condition.\n\nWhen I was 17 I had to go into hospital as I was experiencing major headaches, nosebleeds and my shunt was very prominent from my neck with a rash also present. (The rash also comes up when I am stressed, crying or anxious too. Does anyone else experience this?)\n\n They took me in overnight. I\u2019m not sure what the procedure is called but they did something to do with a \u201creservoir\u201d that you have along your shunt to see if the shunt is functioning correctly. Thankfully, it was. However, when looking back at my last MRI scan from the children\u2019s hospital, they discovered a small glioma in my brain that they say could\u2019ve been what caused my hydrocephalus in the first place. \n\nAlthough I have hydrocephalus, I don\u2019t really understand a lot of the symptoms of it. I know that I experience vision problems (I\u2019ve had glasses since I was 3 years of age), I struggle with my balance, my memory and incontinence (which I feel very ashamed of and don\u2019t know how to control). I\u2019ve recently been under investigation for a possible thyroid nodule which I am worrying about. Despite that, I live a pretty normal life. \n\nI don\u2019t know whether this is the right place to ask for advice or help but\n\nI\u2019ve been very down the past few years and I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ve seen that people with hydrocephalus can suffer with depression and anxiety and I have had CBT to help me with how I am struggling with university and workloads but nothing is helping. \n\nI\u2019m starting to read into everything and I just want answers but I don\u2019t know who I can talk to about getting extra help. I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m struggling with depression but I definitely suffer with anxious and intrusive thoughts. \n\nI really don\u2019t want to self diagnose but I don\u2019t even know how I go about that getting a diagnosis because the last time I went to my GP they just commented on how a lot of their patients struggle with anxiety. \n\nI\u2019m struggling a lot with writing; I feel like I don\u2019t have an intelligent bone in my body and I keep forgetting a lot of simple things.

TLDR questions in bold, and more at bottom in a numbered list. \n\nJust to be thorough here's some bg information, as I wasn't told the specific type of hydro I have: \n\n* In May 2020 I had a pineal gland removal for an obstructive cyst/tumor. My neurosurgeon\u2019s nurse said she\u2019s unsure if I had hydrocephalus before bc of the cyst/tumor itself or if the surgery caused it. What my neuro team is contributing to hydro are symptoms I had before my surgery as well. Was told its often hard for pineal cyst/tumor patients to sense a difference in symptoms of the cyst/tumor and hydro as they are very very similar. \n* Sometime in September my team had me get a lumbar puncture to test for hydro due to continuing headache and neuro symptoms. Opening pressure 22. I was put on Diamox sequels for 2 months with little relief and apparently dangerous side effects I only found out at the 2 month mark.\n* November I had my 6 month post op pinealectomy appointment and was told I most likely have hydrocephalus, but wanted to have my intracranial pressures rechecked and was given it as an option for more peace of mind in case anything changed. I didn't want another brain surgery and needed that peace of mind.\n* Dec 16 had the second LP with the same opening pressure of 22, confirmed hydrocephalus. My nurse mentioned slit ventricles and I had no idea what that meant and was in too much pain to ask.\n\nRecovering that same day in the office, I didn\u2019t get a lot of time with my neurosurgeon at all nor with my nurse. She told me more about what hydrocephalus would mean in my November follow up than Dec 16, so I asked for a brochure or something on hydro but was given my surgeon's basic pre-op guide packet that I got before my pinealectomy. I'm left with a lot of questions. **Should I wait until my pre op appointment to ask my nurse?** Things like, what side will the shunt be on, etc.\n\nAlso, I was told my recovery would be easier than my previous brain surgery as a shunt surgery is less invasive. I'd spend one night in the ICU post op, then would go back to my hotel room (neurosurgeon is based 4 hours away). My plan is to spend a week recovering, then go home for a week and come back for the 2 week post-op appointment and suture removal.   \ntw for brain surgery recovery, emetophobia. Necessary bg info for questions.\n\n&gt;!I had a rough recovery for my pinealectomy in May and am literally terrified of surgery now, especially brain surgery. I had extreme headaches and vomited every single day for 2 weeks until being given scopolamine patches. At around 3-4 weeks post op I called for refills of my pain and antiemetic medications, but was denied any pain prescriptions due to my surgeon's office policy. I wasn't told anything about it pre-op, only when I called. Office policy is no pain med prescriptions past the 2 week post-op mark. Was told to use OTC meds but they made absolutely no difference. I continued to have extreme, 7-10 level headaches until about July.\nIn June I went to ER for headaches and continuing nausea, only after that did I find out in May I walked out of the 2 day Neuro ICU recovery with a really bad UTI, which may have contributed to my symptoms immediately post-op but idk. Surgeon said my recovery was typical but the whole time something felt direly wrong.\nImmediately post-op for the about 2 weeks I spent vomiting every day I also dealt with such severe light sensitivity that when I opened my eyes in a well lit bathroom for example I was literally blinded with whiteness covering my eyes and left with white fog in my vision after it faded. This stopped around a month later.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions for yall:\n\n1. What was your medication regimen like? How long did you need them? How long did your doctor allow you prescriptions? When your prescriptions wore out did you need to use OTC pain meds and did they help?\n2. How can I ask more about the pain and antiemetic med regimen I will get without sounding like I'm medication seeking, even though I am? The pain from my last surgery was the worst in my entire life, like my concussion I got as a child times 50, constantly for weeks and weeks. Been discriminated for pain relief seeking before, though not at this office, but the way the surgeon didn't tell me abt his office policy before my last surgery made me lose trust in him in this aspect.\n3. I know everyone's different, and shunt surgery is different than cyst/tumor removal, but did anyone spend a similar length of time in pain and vomiting *after your shunt surgery* as I spent after my pinealectomy?\n4. Will I most likely also have a similar intensity of light sensitivity as I mentioned under the spoiler?\n5. Is it really easier to recovery from a shunt surgery? Please tell me what your recovery was like, if you are able and willing. \n6. Will the slit ventricles complicate things at all? I briefly read somewhere that people with existing shunts get slit ventricles due to over-draining and that they can obstruct the shunt. What would this mean for me? (I'm planning on asking this question to my nurse as well)\n\nLast, if anyone has any encouragement or advice I'd really appreciate it. If this thread doesn't get many replies due to the length I may make another one close to my surgery date for encouragement.

Everything went well! It turns out they had to replace all of my old distal catheter since they found out through some x-rays that there were several breaks in it, so simply re-connecting the catheter to the valve wouldn't have worked. They also replaced the valve itself. I was initially told the day before surgery by my old neuro's PA that they would be leaving the old tubing in, as most of it is probably really scarred in from being in there for over two decades. When I woke up, I was surprised and happy to hear that my neurosurgeon was able to remove 75% of the old tubing! Only some of it remains near my neck and clavicle. I think I can feel it if I press down into the skin deep enough, but I'm not certain. He was even able to make his incisions directly over the old ones, so hopefully no new scars once everything is all done and healed!\n\nAs far as anesthesia goes, I don't remember jack, which is a wonderful thing! I remember being wheeled into the OR, and one of the anesthesiologists was making small talk, asking me what my favorite movie was, and my favorite bands. I gave him answers, and that's all I remember happening for sure. He may have said \"Alright, now here comes the sleepy medicine\" or something along those lines, but that could've also just been a figment of my imagination. Who knows. Next thing I remember was being wheeled down to recovery, wondering why my head felt odd laying on it. Was obviously from the big bandage they put over my incision.\n\nStayed overnight Friday into Saturday. Came back home Saturday afternoon. My pain/soreness has subsided greatly, so I probably could've went back to school today, but I thought I'd take one more day off just to be sure. Plus lazy...\n\nHad a beautiful overnight nurse Friday evening into Saturday. It felt great having a girl my age care about my not getting much sleep or how I'm doing recovery-wise. Asked her for her number, she said she couldn't give it out because policy, which I figured would be the case. I was feeling ballsy, I didn't care! I hope we cross paths again one day.\n\nI can't thank you all enough for your efforts to console me before all of this! It really meant a lot to me knowing that there are others out there who have gone through the same thing 10x over, or have had their child experience it, which for a parent I imagine is probably even scarier than going through it yourself.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 261, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "VP shunt revision update", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/9gmsg3/vp_shunt_revision_update/"}, {"author": "Ashtyn_Emerson", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_262cat5o", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1536711394, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/9f2unm/hydro_awareness/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9f2unm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/9f2unm/hydro_awareness/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1536711395, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hey!

Since then, really have had no symptoms: I always say I don't know what a true headache is, and I'm seldom nauseous (I mean, if I am, it's from imbibing a bit too much alcohol). I still don't have any symptoms really, albeit a small tender bump near my shunt. It often shrinks and grows back in size over the course of the day. Felt it since about May. It was found out in March after getting checked out by my neurosurgeon for an issue that my parents and I weren't sure was related, that my ventricles had enlarged. This differed radically from my last visit 6 years prior, when I had slit ventricles. After talking to my normal neurosurgeon's PA (who unfortunately is in the stages of retirement), and another neurosurgeon who is fairly new, and whom is going to be performing the revision, it seems that the longer part of the shunt tubing (which after Googling, I realize must be the distal catheter) has disconnected from the valve itself). If any draining is occurring, not all of the CSF is draining directly down the tubing, and some of it is getting trapped essentially in this \"pocket\", as they called it, under the skin near my shunt. My neurosurgeon's typical adage is \"if it's not broke, don't fix it\", and I never have any symptoms. Well, I still don't really have any symptoms, but it is technically broke now, therefore we should fix it. I don't like it, but I get the point.\n\nApparently, I had around 5-6 surgeries related to head stuff/hydro by the time I was 2. But of course, I don't remember that far back. Am still in college so I was initially concerned about how long the recovery time would be. Amazingly, both the PA and this new neurosurgeon said it would be just a day, even if re-connecting the catheter and valve won't work, and the entire tubing needs to be replaced! So I'm happy with that I guess. Overall, just anxious over getting general anesthesia, since apparently they hook you up to a ventilator since your muscles are relaxed so much your brain forgets to keep involuntary breathing going. tl;dr I don't wanna die!\n\nMaybe I'm getting panicky for nothing; after all, people have surgeries literally every day, and neurosurgeons perform brain surgery nearly every day. To top it off, this is a pediatric neurosurgeon performing this. If he's careful enough to treat a small child/baby, he should be just as careful with an adult. \n\nThoughts? Advice? Good vibes?

I had a VP shunt placed at 3 months old after a possible accident left me with hydrocephalus. At three years old they told my mom they thought I was good enough to completely remove it, but she decided not to. All my life I have never had head problems or injuries.\n\nIn my late teens and early twenties I would occasionally get a weird smell in my nose. I got an MRI and my neurosurgeon told me it might be my brain pressing against my sinuses where my skull is thin. Weirdly enough I haven't had that problem in years.\n\nTwo years ago my neck felt stiff along my shunt. I got another MRI. He said that my shunt is nonfuctioning because it is so old, and that everything looked fine.\n\nThis last week I've felt an incredible pressure in my head, specifically behind one eye. I read about papilledema, and while it does say it isn't usually unilateral, I'm still worried. It's giving me a fuzzy pressure headache feeling all day every day that ibuprofen and tylenol aren't helping. But I don't have most of the other symptoms of increased intracranial pressure besides one or two bouts of nausea. My ears sometimes also twinge and feel like they're swollen even though they aren't.

Im concerned and would like to hear experiences with those that have had ETV surgery.\n\n\n **History:**\n\n\nAbout 3 years ago when I was 26 I started having headaches.  An MRI confirmed I had idiopathic hydrocephalus and I had a VP shunt placed shortly after that.  My ventricles went back to normal, but I have had a constant headache of varying degrees for 3 years.  I have a Codman Certas programmable shunt and I have been adjusted back and forth from 1-8 several times by several different Neurosurgeons.  No one has been able to find an answer for my constant headaches.   Ive been on what seems like a million different medications prescribed by my neurologist, but nothing works.\n\nMy current symptoms are a constant headache, minor balance problems, minor memory problems, very minor speech problems that come and go, sensitivity to light/sound/smell, and some problems with appetite/nausea.  This has all slowly gotten worse over the last 3 years.\n\n**My NS's suggestion:**\n\nThe NS I am currently seeing thinks that my shunt is not working correctly. He thinks the shunt is operating as an on-off shunt (Adjusting between 1-8 does not change the amount of CSF flowing, it is either on or off) and thus when it is on, I over-drain, and when it is off my ventricles fill up.  When it is on, my ventricles have been described as \"slit like\".  My NS turned off the shunt to see if I even needed the shunt anymore--I do need the shunt because my ventricles are now large.\n\nAt first he suggested a valve replacement along with adding an anti-siphon device. During our consultation I asked about an ETV because I heard others have had success with that. He said they could do that too and it might allow me to live shunt free.  \n\n\nSo if I understand his reasoning correctly...: He wants to do an ETV in addition to replacing the valve on my shunt, but leave the shunt in the off position to start.  That way, if the ETV fails he can turn on the shunt.  If I do well with the ETV, I can eventually have the shunt removed.  Has anyone had both of these surgeries done at the same time?\n\nSide note: I thought it was a little weird that my neurosurgeon didnt suggest an ETV until I brought it up.  Although I feel comfortable with my current NS, it left me wondering if I should look for a 2nd opinion.  \n\n**Concerns:**\n\nIm mostly concerned by how much more invasive an ETV is compared to just doing a shunt valve replacement.  Ive seen several posts saying that an ETV only made things worse for several reasons including causing memory problems.  \n\n\nI know that at the end of the day I need to listen to my neurosurgeons advice, but if anyone can provide helpful information or personal stories about their ETV it would be appreciated.  Ive been looking for an answer to my awful headaches for so long, but now that there is somewhat of a plan it feels like everything is moving so fast and is overwhelming.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 465, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can anyone provide me with information or personal experiences with ETV?

Our beautiful and healthy baby boy was born on March 16th, 2019 and our life changed on May 6th, 2019. I got a call from my wife that Monday morning in a panic that our son was having a seizure and she wasn't sure what to do. I told her to hang up and dial 911 and she did just that. I ran out of my office and took an Uber straight to the hospital. I didn't know the severity of things at the time but I had a bad feeling. When I arrived, I was told our son had a brain hemorrhage in the middle of his brain and that they didn't have the proper equipment to help him. He was rushed to Lurie Children's Hospital where they could help him. They did another quick MRI before pulling us into a room to share the results. What we were looking at was pretty serious, there was quite a lot of blood in the middle of our son's brain and the doctor's weren't sure he'd make it or what the future held for us. My wife and I were a mess, we couldn't believe what was happening. The only bright side was that the hemorrhage occurred right next to one of the ventricles and the blood seemed to be seeping in there. This was causing damage in the ventricle, therefore causing hydrocephalus. They decided to take him to emergency surgery to put in an external ventricular drain (EVD) to try to filter the blood out.   \n\n\nWe proceeded to spend the longest 5 weeks of our lives in the hospital. When I tell you this was the toughest moment of my life, it'd be an understatement. Hours upon hours spent doing research online, seeing pictures of kids online with hydrocephalus, reading horror stories, etc. Let me start right there by telling you, just don't do it. It's okay to read about hydrocephalus in a medical sense to get accustomed to the medical terms so that you can have educated conversations with the doctors, however, outside of that, just stay away from the stories/pics. It will scare the crap out of you. EVERY SINGLE CASE IS DIFFERENT. Seeing our child barely awake, with wonky eyes, barely responsive was absolutely heartbreaking. It goes without saying that each of us handle things differently. My wife and I included. As a mother, she simply took it a lot harder and consequently took it out on me harder. Being in a room for 5 weeks together and never leaving tested our relationship in every way. We were just scared, uncertain about the future and frankly going insane with cabin fever. However, neither of us could leave without feeling guilty. Thank God for our amazing families that visited just about every day and brought us home cooked meals and clothes. I'll forever be grateful (the 1 hour commute each way is not easy).  \n\n\nFast forward past SO MANY meetings with doctors, frustrating days of no real answers, tears, etc and they came to the decision to put in a shunt in our son's head. The EVD did all it could and the spinal fluid coming out as no longer showing blood in it, however, the ventricle had too much damage and wasn't working properly on it's own. My wife and I were so sad, we didn't want a device in our son's head, especially because he had been showing such promise with the EVD. When they did the surgery and we saw our kid for the first time, we were taken back. The device looked SO big in his head. Mind you he's only 11 weeks old at this point so that was a big factor we weren't thinking about at the time.  \n\n\nAfter the shunt was installed we went home and life was different. Our son still isn't fully all \"there\". His eyes are still wonky, he has a bit of a lazy eye that developed, he'd cry randomly. My wife and I were so cautious and short tempered with each other. Any little thing the one or other did would set us off because we were just living in fear. Fear that this would happen again. Life was hard for months, VERY hard. We still had no idea what the long term effects would be. All we knew is we had so many follow up appointments scheduled we needed to figure out with our work schedules.  \n\n\nNow the good news, our son is 7 months old as of 10/16/19. He's a big, strong, happy and healthy boy. He weighs 22lbs and is 28 inches long which is 90th percentile on both fronts. His head has grown, the shunt is barely visible under his hair, his lazy eye has corrected itself, his overall senses are sharp. We've had follow up visits and MRI's at the hospital and there is no blood left in his brain. He was also monitored for seizures and he hasn't had any. His shunt level has been lowered to the lowest possible setting meaning he barely needs it anymore. I look back at everything we went through and I could have never guessed this is where we'd be. After all the horror stories, pictures, emotions, meetings with doctors, etc. this is the best possible outcome for us. We still don't know for sure what will come in the future, however, we're beyond blessed and happy.  \n\n\nIf you're reading this and you're in a similar situation. Please understand that every child's situation is different. Some kids haven't been as fortunate as my son, others have done even better. However, your attitude about this all will determine a lot. Please be kind to your partner. Please read the medical terms and stay away from the pictures/horror stories. Do all you can to take care of your own mental health during this time (it'll go a long way). Please be patient and understand this will take time. I wish you nothing but luck with your child.

I've tried to convince TWO Neurosurgeons that I think EVEN though on a CT-scan the shunt looks fine, the symptoms I am constantly going through....well, it's been 15 yrs and I honestly think that there's issues with the programmable that the docs CAN'T SEE.\n\nYears ago, I kept vomiting and having severe headaches. The doctor kept telling me that the \"shunt\" (IT WAS a VP shunt back then) looked fine on CT-scans. Finally he decided to take me to the OR and take a \"look\" at the shunt......It was only 18 months old and when he took the shunt out, it FELL apart in his hands and had calcium &amp; protein deposits all over it. That shunt was replaced with another VP Shunt.\n\nFast forward 3-4 more years. The headaches and the vomiting and the Vertigo was ridiculous. I began seeing the Head of Neurosurgery, Professor &amp; Chair of the department. He decided to put a lower pressure shunt in...and that caused even more issues.....after another 23 shunt revisions (and a 55 day hospital stay....) The decision to put the Programmable shunt in was made.\n\n   Now, I still vomit daily and the headaches are relentless. With the current issues with pain meds, it's a joke. It's 4:30 am and this is what happens EVERY darn night. I sleep for 1-2 hours per night, and get up and that's the extent of my day. \n\nDue to the fact I had SOOO many issues with the 55 day stint in the hospital (BTW I was in the Neuro ICU for all but 48 hours of that stay, they tried to put me in a Step-Down unit....and I returned to the ICU. Finally the doctor make it clear to the insurance company he WASN'T comfortable moving me out of  Neuro ICU...\u2026.I don't know too many patients that are DISCHARGED for Neuro ICU at all.\n\nSo, my question is.....did the EVT help you? Do you wish you had not had the surgery? I am 65 yrs old now, and while I am not afraid of the surgery itself, due to the horrendous issues I had previously, I'm not sure I should do this. \n\nIn fact, during the 55 day hospital stay for all those revisions, it was discussed to the EVT then...and the Chief Neuro decided NOT to the EVT. I don't remember his reasonings for this, but I thought that due the fact he was Prof &amp; Chair of the Department.....he knew best.\n\nAny comments or suggestions would be appreciated.

Laterals and third are enlarged and they think he's got a cyst down near the base/spinal cord. An MRI is scheduled for next Thursday but it seems surgery is certain, just a matter of when and what kind/how much. My wife and I are besides ourselves.\n\nWe've already been told he's not a candidate for ETV. So it seems that as of right now there 2 options: first is just ignore the cyst and just put a shunt in. They make it sound like it's the safer option but from what I've read, it seems like revisions are common and infections are a big risk. The doctor made it sound like it's really not to big of an issue if it's all done right the first time.\n\nSecond option I think would be they go in, remove the cyst, and basically drain the fluid externally, monitor flow/pressure, and if the cyst was the cause, he gets away without a shunt. They made this seem like a riskier surgery and even then he might end up with a shunt anyway if the cyst wasn't the only thing causing the imbalance.\n\nI guess the positive is that he doesn't have any signs of issues, besides the larger noggin. So they made it sound like we have a little time to take a closer look, evaluate options, and then act instead of coming into ER and having to rush.\n\nAre there any other parents who were in this boat we've found ourselves in?

I had heard new research that suggests covid affects gray matter so I pulled up my recent MRI to have a look and see if that had or would affect me.\n\nI saw that in the MRI that I have pineal cysts and mild aqueductal stenosis that has caused \"ventral displacement of the tectum\" but NO evidence of acute hydrocephalus. However, this appears to suggest some sort of hydrocephalus. I don't expect anyone to be a doctor hahaha but I was never even told that I had any of these other brain abnormalities. I don't have any symptoms that suggest this, but I have always had difficulty moving eyes/eye pressure that I thought was related to my (also horrible) sinuses. The addendum basically only said that these issues were incidental and nothing else.\n\nLooking to see if anyone also has pineal cysts/aqueductal stenosis. Is it just not a big deal to certain doctors if those conditions are causing basically no symptoms? Would you bring this up to your own doctor if this was you? How has it affected your life?

[Link to recall](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfres/res.cfm?id=185453)\n\nI got my first shunt this January 27, 2021 and I\u2019m only just now finding out that the valve has been recalled. I\u2019ve been having ongoing pressure issues since getting the shunt. \nI\u2019ve had a painful lumbar puncture and like 6 pressure adjustments since then. I don\u2019t know why it took this long to get notified. It seems like I was only told because of the fact that I was also, in the same phone call, told that my surgeon not only left the practice but I can\u2019t see the acting nurse practitioner who\u2019s treated me ever since and who I\u2019ve become to trust. She\u2019s referring me to another surgeon?/ doctor, thankfully in the same office, but I feel blindsided. \n\nMedtronic initiated the recall about two weeks before my surgery, and the recall was official two weeks after. I don\u2019t know how this oversight could have happened, if it was a failure of communication from my surgery team or what. But I\u2019ve been sick for months, and they were exploring the possibility that I didn\u2019t need a shunt or I may have a CSF leak. I guess I\u2019m kinda just shocked, upset, and feel physically sickened about this situation and needing my first revision surgery to replace the valve. I knew another surgery was a possibility with this condition but hoped it wouldn\u2019t be so soon, my first brain surgery and then the shunt surgery were pretty traumatic and recovery was rough. I\u2019m afraid of what I\u2019ll feel like after the surgery and how I\u2019ll look with my head shaved again after my hairs finally growing back in from January. \n\nCan anyone tell me about their first revision, or offer any advice?

I wanted to share my story related to hydrocephalus and ask if anyone else here has experienced similar challenges. \n\nI discovered that I have hydrocephalus at the age of 8 years old. Thereafter, I was admitted into hospital and  underwent surgery to insert a shunt that will drain cerebrospinal fluid from my head. Was discharged but the following year, I had to be readmitted and undergo more surgeries at the age of 9. \n\nThe challenges that I have faced are: \n-low self esteem because for a long time I wished that I was normal but I've come to accept myself with my condition. I'm still working on loving myself 100% though.\n\n-being slow, hands shake all the time, poor balance.\n\n-mental illnesses which include anxiety, depression, cptsd (not sure about this, I might have it at the moment), OCD. \n\nOne thing I have need to add is that I have grown up in an emotionally abusive home. \n\n- I have also struggled to make friends and start dating. I have greatly improved in my social skills so I've been able to form healthy friendships but sometimes the friendships don't feel extremely fulfilling. I think it's because I have a hard time communicating my feelings to other people and I have a tendency to bottle things up.  I don't have many friends which is something I don't have a problem with. The problem comes in when I'm trying to make new friends and at times I feel like I'm not as important to them as they are to me. Most of my friendships eventually fade as much as I believed the friendship was genuine.\n\nI believe communicating my feelings would go a long way in making things better for me though. \n\nFeedback would be highly appreciated.

On the scan, they spotted 2 large aranoid cystes, a subdural hematoma and the hypothesis is that one leaked CSF following the fall creating the hematoma. \nAfter transfert to another specialized hospital, he was given corticoides with the hope to avoid surgery. Back home for a week but as soon as the corticoides were over, symptoms came back. \nFirst surgery was decided but only a catheter was placed (no valve), which is the common procedure at this hospital (the idea is that it can be done passively as pressure between the head cavity and the peritoneal one equilibrate themselves, which seems to work most of the time). But it did not happen, he was not able to seat afterwards, triggering almost immediately headeach and vomit. Photophobia still there. Under constant strong pain killers. Worse than before the surgery. Surgeons explanation : overdraining, a valve must be placed. Yet before new surgery, new MRI is done and the hematoma although reduced is still there. During the 2nd surgery (5 days after the 1st one), an intern informed us that the catheter is also replaced because when tested, it showed signs of obstruction. So we went to overdraining hypothesis to tube clogging in a span of 12 h. \nThe day after the surgery when waking up, it is clear that he is much more better. No Photophobia, no pain. The surgeon who was quite confident ahead of the 1st surgery, was quite perplexed (and might I said a bit blow away with not much explanation of what is really happening). \nThen 4 months later, the kid has no symptoms and a new control MRI is done followed by neurosurgeon appointment, with the idea to reduce the valve flow to try to weaning him off the shunt. But as the surgeon is looking the images, his face changes. Actually my son sub dural hematoma is thiker than between the 2 surgeries (2 millimeters more) while he is has no symptoms. An eye exam is done in the following week and no pressure was observed. \nSo basically, fine sub dural hematoma between 2 surgeries and awful clinical condition VS thinker sub dural hematoma and no symptoms. The surgeon is really perplexed and says that he has to \"understand\" how my kid is functioning because this is not textbook. That he relies on his symptoms and he not going to operate just for his brain to look like textbook picture. So the only thing we can do is be attentive to any degradation.

I found this group just a few days ago, and I wanted to share my story. I hope it helps someone out. I think something I read here that really resonated with me is that you really have to be your own advocate. Even when the scans don't agree, you know what you are going through the best. \n\nI'm a medical student, which makes going through all of this both easier and harder. Easier in the sense that I can understand a lot of the medical terminology, harder in the sense that, well, med school lol. \n\nDuring the start of my first year of medical school, I slipped down 18 steps in my second floor apartment. My roommates and a few friends watched me slip, and none of us could make sense as to how it happened. I don't recall hitting my head either. Anyways, I had gone to an urgent care for back  and neck pain and headaches. They diagnosed me with a back contusion, put me on steroids, and sent me my way. Three weeks later, the headaches just got unbearable, and I decided I had to go to my school's ER. They found right-side weakness and the scans showed my ventricles were twice the size of a normal person's. Anyways, I was transferred to another hospital. My spinal tap showed normal pressure, at which point the surgeon was considering sending me home and observing. However, the next morning, my walking was very unstable and so they decided to operate. I got a ETV done, as a 23 year old I did not want a shunt in me. After speaking to doctor's, we were leaning towards the fact that perhaps the hydrocephalus and loss of balance caused me to slip down the stairs. As a kid, no doctor ever mentioned having it. Thankfully the procedure went well, and I even started doing research with my surgeon on the benefits of a laparascopic VP Shunt approach. \n\nFast forward almost a year later, I started having very similar headaches again. My eyes started to hurt a lot, and I felt dizzy and somewhat off balance. My scans showed no real change, so my surgeon decided to do a lumbar puncture as a last rule-out. He wasn't expecting anything out of the ordinary. Even my parents were doubtful; they just felt I was being too sensitive to headaches and what not. All the meanwhile, I knew something seemed off and it was way to similar to my symptoms last year. Anyways, the LP revealed a high pressure in my skull, one that could cause permanent damage to my eye sight.  It was decided there that I need a VP shunt, and I had surgery a few days later. \n\nI am two weeks post-op now, and it has been quite a tough recovery for me. I think mentally, I am more drained than when I had the ETV done, and the incisional pain is quite prominent for me. It definitely was and feels like a way more invasive procedure, and as a medical student, I am a bit worried about how this will impact me moving forward. \n\nThat's my story for now, would love to answer any questions!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 981, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My VP Shunt Story", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/putxvv/my_vp_shunt_story/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MarshmelloCarol", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9n8883s", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1632460642, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/pud1z2/vp_programmable_shunt_done_90_days_and_needed/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pud1z2", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/pud1z2/vp_programmable_shunt_done_90_days_and_needed/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1632460653, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 980, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "VP programmable shunt done 90 days and needed revision.

The doctors sure don't.  \n\nBackground: I am 33F and live in New England,   USA .\n\n I had a benign brain tumor removed from my cerebellum in two surgeries,  when I was 13 and 15 (1999 &amp; 2001). The tumor was massive, about the size of my fist,  and slow-growing. It was attached to my brain stem, so in '99 they were only able to remove  80% of the tumor. They monitored me closely  following my first surgery, I had  MRI's every 3 months for over a year, until eventually the worst case scenario happened and the tumor reestablished the blood supply and began growing again. Surgery number 2 was able to completely remove the tumor as it has pulled away from my brain stem. \n\nDuring my first surgery I also had a VP shunt put in to drain the excess cerebrospinal fluid, and there was a lot. \n\nQuestion/Concerns: I have had the same shunt for over 20 years now and literally never had a problem,  no replacements or fixes. The thing is a beast, and apparently that's pretty incredible.  \n\nOver a year ago I started getting pain and swelling in the incision site on my abdomen. I am pretty thin, and you could/can literally see a lump of swelling right where my shunt disappears into my abdomen, where ir drains into my stomach. The lump is painful, and is located directly aboveb the incision. \n\nWhen I first had it checked out I was sent for a CT to see if it was a hernia. Scan came back perfectly clean. \n\nThen, the pain and swelling went away. Completely. This lasted for months. \n\nLast November it came back with avengeance. For seemingly no reason. I hadn't fallen, changed meds (im.on no medications, haven't been for years) hurt myself exercising, been in an accident.  Nothing. \n\nI ended up calling the neurologist and they sent me to the ER thinking it must be the shunt itself malfunctioning,  after all it's never had a tune up.  \n\nThey checked every part of my shunt, blood work  (to look for infections), did more scans (xray and CT), and found nothing. They also checked my organs. Liver and pancreas are functioning great. No hernias. \n\nI also get extremely dizzy when I bend over, or lay down flat on my back. This happened when I first had surgery,  but went almost entirely away for years and years. Now, it's back and it can't be a coincidence. \n\nSo, I then met with a neurosurgeon.  He felt my belly where the pain is, could feel the swelling,  made me cry from pushing on it. But ultimately told me he didn't know what to do. I lost  it, started balling, just wanted some answers and am scared and frustrated that no one seems to have a clue. He ended up saying if I'm absolutely sure I want to remove the shunt, we can. He's a surgeon,  that was the only comfort he could offer. But obviously that's a major surgery and I'm not going to just do that. \n\nThe swelling and pain come and go in large time frames.  It'll be here for weeks, sometimes months, then recede for a few months usually. Right now it's painful and inflamed,  the swelling is all around my incision and travels up my shunt towards my chest slightly. \n\nRight now it is extremely painful, swollen and inflamed. I have a photo of the swelling if anyone thinks that would help. I just can't attach it to this post \ud83d\ude44\n\nIt's entirely baffling.

\n\nHowever, recently (around a year) I've been having memory issues and have been urinating more often then usual.\n\n\nNote that my doctor suspects I may have neurofibromatosis as well and I'm being tested for that soon", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 960, "subreddit_type": "public",

hydrocephalus.  My shunt was inserted when I was 28 days old.  I have had 5 surgeries.  Several were done when it malfunctioned during my childhood and one was simply to lengthen my tubing to accommodate growth (which is funny since I have been 4'9\" since grade school but have enough tubing to grow to be 7'). LOL\n\nWhen I was in my early teens we were told I had outgrown my need for the shunt.  While it was kept in place, for the next 30 years it was never looked at again, and, any medical issues I have had since (chronic headaches, vertigo, back/neck pain) were all determined to be allergy related or no known cause.  Hydro and a potentially failing shunt were never discussed.\n\nIn May 2017 I woke up one day with double vision and paralysis in my legs.  I was rushed to the hospital and a neurologist initially diagnosed me with Guillain Barre Syndrome.  3 weeks later I was completely blind and now my arms were also losing function.\n\nI was transferred to Hopkins and was immediately had my shunt checked and it was determined I DID still need it and that it had malfunctioned.  It was replaced immediately.\n\nI regained use of my legs and arms but not my vision.  However, otherwise, I am fine now.\n\nI have seen many threads about peing no longer needing their shunt and if they should remove it.  I am sharing my experience, not to scare anyone, but to encourage you to always live and consider medical issues as if you still have hydro and  need a shunt, even if the doctors say otherwise.  Get regular check ups to ensure it is still working.  Always tell other health providers about it.  Do NOT have it removed.  Even if you supposedly don't need it, the shunt isn't hurting anything.  Leave it in place.\n\nI just don't want anyone else to let their guard down and stop living like they have hydro and go through what I did.  I love my life and it worked out for me.  I am not complaining.

In June of 2020, it finally failed. The doctors here in Spain tried to use the same shunt but couldn't.\n\nI now have 2 programmable shunts. I have had more problems with these than I ever had with my old shunt. I ended up spending 3 months in the hospital and I lost my ability to eat, drink, walk and talk normally.\n\nAfter I was discharged from the hospital, I started 6 months of speech and physical therapy 5 days a week. Luckily now I can walk, talk, eat and drink again.\n\nBut I am still underweight (I lost a dramatic amount of weight and had to be on a feeding tube)\n\nMy eye went cross eyed due to the the pressure from my shunt failure.

Had a freak occurrence happen to me at age 20 - a ruptured brain aneurysm. The aneurysm was later determined to be something I\u2019d had since birth, and it just happened to burst at age 20. It\u2019s been determined that I have no other remaining aneurysms. I had a clip placed on the broken vein. Two weeks after that initial craniotomy, I started experiencing severe hydrocephalus. Had a shunt put in.\n\nAnyway, against all odds, I eventually recovered fully. I finished college, &amp; I\u2019m married now with three kids. \n\nThe last time I had my shunt \u201cchecked\u201d was 15 years ago before I first started trying to get pregnant. (I wanted to make sure my body was able to handle pregnancy/birth.) At the times, it was more or less implied to me that it wasn\u2019t really necessary to have \u201ccheck-ups\u201d on my shunt, since the hydrocephalus was trauma-induced and was considered to be \u201cresolved\u201d (this was a long time ago, I don\u2019t remember if that\u2019s the exact word that was used). Since then, I\u2019ve had no contact with any neurologist. No follow-ups. \n\nMy question: **Do I need to go get my shunt checked out?** How do I know if it\u2019s still functioning? Do I need to look into getting it removed if my hydro has truly \u201cresolved\u201d? Or would it be too invasive to have it taken out?\n\nI probably need to get a referral to a neurologist in order to get these questions answered\u2026IDK. Right now I\u2019d just really appreciate some input from this group. I feel like sort of an outlier since my hydrocephalus wasn\u2019t something I was born with or have had since childhood; it was caused by acute injuries to the brain. \n\nAnyway, thanks in advance.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 958, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Diagnosed w/ hydrocephalus after ruptured aneurysm 22 years ago.

I\u2019ve had my shunt since Jan 27 2021, and I still feel like I know nothing about my condition, I\u2019m not confident about my symptoms being attributed to hydrocephalus. I had hydro for over 6 months in a severe way that caused un-shunted slit ventricles, and during that time my headaches were all the time, no matter if I was upright or laying down. I had all the symptoms of untreated hydrocephalus. \n\n[A little background on my situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/mku5g3/confusion_about_symptoms_of_over_or_underdrainage/gu3cqyo/)\n\nNow, I\u2019ve been adjusted multiple times since then and still have debilitating headaches but thankfully not at the same pain level as before. I\u2019ve had positional headaches on and off since then. It feels like the same sensation as when I had an LP before, the spinal headache before a blood patch, as if gravity was trying to force my spine out of my body, just not to the same pain levels as what I felt after the actual LP. \n\nSince my last adjustment in June I haven\u2019t felt a lot of relief. My headaches are almost all the time, and sometimes not positional. I\u2019ve had pain along my shunt line including where it goes into my head, and during those time my gait, brain fog, memory, and understanding of anything going on around me is acutely worse. I thought it was because of the weather, as my hydro symptoms come back/get worse when it\u2019s stormy and the atmosphere has been unstable since June, but I also now feel the same on sunny days too. My symptoms get worse in cycles every few days. Sometimes my shunt feels like it\u2019s not working as well as it should, the only way I know how to describe it is that it feels sticky inside. I\u2019ve had a shuntogram but not the one where they inject dye into the shunt, my NP wants to avoid that if possible because it\u2019s invasive. The shuntogram seemed normal but the radiologist couldn\u2019t tell if the ending of the tube went into my peritoneal cavity or not due to gas. \n\nI called my NP last week saying I thought I was having problems with the shunt, when she called me back I was in the car and having symptoms, therefore experiencing cognitive issues, so that made communicating difficult and I ended up not being as thorough with my symptoms as I wanted, only getting out that I wasn\u2019t sure if my headaches were positional all the time, but they are sometimes. :/ She wants me to keep a headache journal for the next two weeks and then get back to her and she\u2019ll help determine if it\u2019s all because of hydro. She seems to put a lot of emphasis on the headaches being positional, and doesn\u2019t seem to attribute the rest of my reoccurrence of hydro symptoms as being due to hydro. It\u2019s all very confusing for me, I\u2019m not confident in my ability to communicate what I\u2019m going through anymore, and it\u2019s really stressful.\n\nPart of my problem is that I\u2019m in tx where covid is overwhelming the hospitals, so I wanna avoid my condition getting worse and needing the ER. Another thing is that my surgeon team is in Houston so a lot of communication is sub-par over the phone, and she only wants me coming down there for adjustments or surgical interventions because the hospitals there are even more overwhelmed than my city. I can get down there no problem, but this uncertainty about my symptoms is making the situation feel more dire. I also will not be seeing any neurologists or neurosurgeons in my city if I need a second opinion, and explaining would take up more text than needed. After an already long post. \n\nI need help figuring out what to do from here, waiting another 2 weeks and documenting headaches that are barely relieved by anything is almost unbearable, and my memory issues are already getting in the way of keeping the record.

I live in the Southern US (but I am from the Midwest)\n\n\nAfter four years of being sick, a cholecystectomy, and two misdiagnosis, my current GI specialist did an MRI on my brain and it showed mild hydrocephalus. We went over the results on the 18th and a referral to a neurologist was sent. \n\n\nI\u2019m honestly not sure how I have hydrocephalus, I\u2019ve never had a head injury-there are no signs or tumors,hemorrhages, or meningitis. I\u2019ve never had an MRI done on my brain before. So it\u2019s hard for me to say if I\u2019ve had this my entire life, or if it started recently, or if it was the problem originally 4 years ago. I\u2019d like to hope that my faulty gallbladder was the reason for being originally sick. Because I felt better for like 3 months after surgery and then I was back to being sick again. I did somehow contract C.Diff. During that surgery-was treated but still sick after treatment for the c.diff. \n\n\nI have some symptoms that I\u2019m not sure if anyone else experiences, I\u2019m honestly really scared. I have some anxiety when it comes to \u201chead things\u201d.  But here are my symptoms \n\n-weight loss (I was 140lbs at my heaviest and now I\u2019m down to 112.8lbs I\u2019m 5ft 6.25in).\n\n-nausea and vomiting, poor appetite and stomach pains. \n\n-lethargic/exhausted all the time. Sometimes it feels like my legs have weights. \n\n- I get moments of where my vision will fade from my peripherals to the center of my vision-then I lose it for like 5 seconds. This usually happens when I take the stairs and while delayed-after I get up from sitting down. I say delayed because I could be 10-15 feet from where I was sitting before it starts to affect me. However, when this happens my body becomes very weak and my arms and legs will become shaky. (I thought this may be low blood pressure? But the GI specialist said it sounded neurological).\n\n-hand tremors. My hands shake slightly. \n\n-malnutrition and fat malabsorption (I have low vitamin K on and off)\n\n-memory issues and sometimes I feel like my brain has \u201cinternet explorer\u201d moments where it\u2019s like I need time to process what was just said.\n\n-I get dizzy and have fallen a couple of times. \n\n\nThis is all that I can remember at this time.

The pain and side effects being unlike my previous migraines, an MRI was scheduled\n\n\"You have excess fluid around your brain, you'll need surgery\"\n\nThat's where things started as I finished my MRI. The pain I was feeling from the headaches was also leading to high blood pressure; for the first time in my life.\n\nAfter a day in the hospital, I spoke with a Nerologist who did a complete exam full of Q&amp;A, cognitive testing and motor skills. Everything was \"very good\" and follow up would be needed for a Cisternogram. Once we figured out the right meds to bring my BP down, I went home, managing pain with Tylenol.\n\nOver the next week, I had a LP and follow up images as part of the Cisternogram. The results? \"There is no blockage of fluid in your spine or your brain.\n\nThat was that. Within 1.5 weeks, I went from \"you have excess fluid in your brain and need surgery\" to \"we're happy with what we see at this time, no further action is needed.\"\n\nCurrently, headaches are the only side effect I'm having from this. I can go 24-36 hours without a headache, but most of the time, I have to take 2-6 Tylenol 500mg within a 24 hr period to keep the headaches back. My primary care physician says that with basic over the counter pain medication working against the headaches without being in excess, there's no worries at this time since there are no other symptoms.\n\nThe headaches come fast. I keep Tylenol in the house, in my car and if I'm going to be away from both, physically on me. The moment I feel pain in my left forehead or close to my left eye, I have to take something. If I don't, that bad boy it's a 5-6 on a scale of 10 within a good 5-10 minutes. Tylenol eventually kicks in within 20-30 minutes if I do end up taking it too late.\n\nI've looked at various posts in here, and many of you are post-surgery. Did anyone go through this type of \"holding pattern\" when they were first diagnosed, if as an adult? I've been told that the side effects of hydrocephalus is not limited to problems controlling my bladder, dizziness, memory and other cognitive issues that are similar to dementia. \n\nI trust my PCP and the Neurologist when they say everything looks good and no further action is needed.

Prior to my Hydrocephalus diagnosis, I hadn\u2019t even had surgery or been in hospital before. Never even broken a bone. \n\nThe last period I had was on the 9th of August. I was diagnosed with Hydrocephalus on the 18th August after having had symptoms for 8/9 months. I had an ETV on the 20th of August was sent home 2 days later. Unfortunately my ETV was unsuccessful and I ended up back in hospital with CSF leaking from my wound. \n\nI had a shunt fitted on the 3rd of September but caught a CSF infection so had the shunt removed and wasfitted with an EVD. I then went on a 24 day course of antibiotics to clear the infection. During those 24 days, I had to have the EVD changed twice because they malfunctioned/started leaking (each change required an hour long surgery under general anaesthetic.) \n\nI had my final surgery to put the shunt back in on 25th of September and everything has been going well since then. The only thing is I haven\u2019t had a period since before my first surgery. Prior to all of these surgeries, my periods ran like clockwork. My Neurosurgery team did say that I would experience some hormonal changes and that they would sort themselves out. I spoke to my GP who pretty much said the thing.

By some medical miracle, he recovered well enough with some minor short-term memory loss. He was doing really really well up until about two months ago or so when he started getting very confused, and forgetful, referring to conversations and people that simply were not there. A couple of times he tried to go to work (he retired three years ago). At first my mum assumed my dad starting to show dementia symptoms, but his decline was so fast, that this didn\u2019t make sense. It turns out following referral to his neurosurgeon and a subsequent CT scan, that he has hydrocephalus. I didn\u2019t know this, but it\u2019s apparently a common complication following a head injury.\n\nThat was two weeks ago. He\u2019s had his shunt fitted today, and is recovering in ICU. Obviously we are hoping for full recovery from the surgery, but in the last couple of weeks the dementia symptoms that he had started to show had got extreme and I am wondering if anybody else experienced this and if so what their experience of recovery was like did you recover in full or do you still have occasional confusion and delirium? If you did recover, can you remember anything leading up to the shunt being fitted? \n\nI know everybody\u2019s experience of this sort of thing is different, (and I know there are no easy answers) but I don\u2019t want to google this in case I find horror stories. I\u2019m trying to be as positive as possible without expecting miracles. \n\n(I\u2019m not sure if it matters or it makes a difference but I am based in the UK my parents are based in Portugal)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 718, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Recovery from Dementia-Like Symptoms?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/jxwk0p/recovery_from_dementialike_symptoms/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ScrumpLump", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5uklfnab", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605302180, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/jtop65/anyone_have_an_infant_with_a_vp_shunt_willing_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jtop65", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/jtop65/anyone_have_an_infant_with_a_vp_shunt_willing_to/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1605302191, "score": 1, "selftext": "(I'm new to posting on reddit, please forgive any formatting errors.

In June, after months of being in and out of the ER, a neurosurgeon finally caught that her shunt had grown out of place and she had her revision. \n\nNow she's starting to show the same symptoms again: suddenly very distraught, lethargy, and vomiting. She always feels better about 30 minutes after the vomiting and then it'll come back a week or so later. I feel like a crazy person, bringing in a happy and alert baby, insisting something is wrong, having her go through the whole process of an MRI and X-ray and several hours of getting poked, tired and starving, just to be told that everything on the images looks good. The same neurosurgeon who caught it last time was the one who was who saw her imaging this time, so I trust her judgement. \n\nWe've been trying to find any other explanations (stomach bug? Allergies? Got into something when we weren't looking?) but no leads so far.

Especially over my nose, cheeks and forehead. I went to hospital and they made an Computed Tomography of my head and discovered that I may have Hydrocephalus because my ventricles are larger than usual.\n\nThen I went to an hospital and they made an lumbar puncture and my pressure was hig but not that high. And they told me that my symptoms are not usual for Hydrocephalus because I only had heavy facial pains und pain on the forehead. \n\nThey were so painful I didn't know that something like that was even possible. A burning and tearing all over my face. \n\nSince that day the pain never leaved me in peace. And no Painkiller helped me. They even tried opioids but they didn't help. \n\nAnd after Months I started getting Jaw Pains and the doc discovered a crossbite but he didn\u2019t recommend a brace before I clarified the facial pain bc it can get worse.\n\nThey made any test and an MRI of my head and body and didn't find the reason for the Hydrocephalus?! They called it a normal pressure Hydrocephalus. And I think I have it since I was born bc my head is a little bit bigger that usual. But never had or feeled a pain like that.\n\nThey gave me Diamox und some anti-epileptic drugs for the chronic pain but no improvement yet. \n\nDoes anybody have/had some similar symptoms with Hydrocephalus? \n\nSome side Information: Male, 25 Years, 120kg at 1,88m, Electronic Engineer", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 940, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hydrocephalus/Facial Pain", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/os47bn/hydrocephalusfacial_pain/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HomeCrafter97", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bypf1p1v", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1627183727, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/or447j/worries_about_school/", "gildings": {}, "id": "or447j", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/or447j/worries_about_school/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1627183737, "score": 1, "selftext": "My son is 3 and we are going to be starting with the school program this year.

The term hydrocephalus is derived from the Greek words \"hydro\" meaning water and \"cephalus\" meaning the head. Although it translates as \"water on the brain,\" the word actually refers to the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid, a clear organic liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. CSF is in constant circulation within the ventricles of the brain and serves many crucial functions: 1) it acts as a \"shock absorber\" for the brain and spinal cord; 2) it acts as a vehicle for delivering nutrients to the brain and removing waste from it; and 3) it flows between the cranium and spine to regulate changes in pressure.\n\nWhen CSF builds up around the brain, it can create harmful pressures on the tissues of the brain confined within the skull. The accumulation of CSF occurs due to either an increase in production of the fluid, a decrease in its rate of absorption or from a condition that blocks its normal flow through the ventricular system.\n\nHydrocephalus can occur at any age, but is most common in infants and adults age 60 and older. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), hydrocephalus is believed to affect approximately one to two in every 1,000 children born in the U.S. The majority of these cases are often diagnosed before birth, at the time of delivery or in early childhood.\n\nHaiti is the poorest country in our part of the world and with a population of about 10 million people, it does not have *any* trained pediatric neurosurgeons. As individuals affected by hydrocephalus, whether having it ourselves or having a loved one who has it, we know all too well what this means for the children there with hydrocephalus. These kids went untreated and suffered the debilitating, and sometimes deadly, results of this condition. The majority of children with hydrocephalus in Haiti were male (54.8%, n = 197), born in the rainy season (59.7%, n = 233), and born in a coastal/inland location (43.3%, n = 61). The most common surgical intervention was endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC) (45.7%, n = 175).\n\nhelp use save these kids cos every children count by your donation do it on:\n\nvenmo: +1786228486\n\npaypal: [jemmanuel.ht@gmail.com](mailto:jemmanuel.ht@gmail.com)\n\nzelle: +17866228486", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 927, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": 103, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Hydrocephalus in Haiti- we need help", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/omeg3n/hydrocephalus_in_haiti_we_need_help/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "martin__sloan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5hydjntv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626410281, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ol9nsu/how_obvious_are_infections/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ol9nsu", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ol9nsu/how_obvious_are_infections/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1626410292, "score": 1, "selftext": "I had an ETV 4 1/2 months ago, I have an existing shunt.

Sometimes we know our pain best. Then the trigger stuff.\n\nBefore my second shunt I went six months of being really sick with sevear headaches every couple of days. I couldn't turn my head without pain where the tube enters my skull, sometimes I had to be really careful even walking or riding my bike even when I was 'well' because jolting the shunt hurt. I lost loads of weight cause like nearly half the days I couldn't keep stuff down. Turns out the shunt had slipped far out of place and the lower pipe was perished. Cause we could feel where the valve was my dad, an engineer, theorised the shunt had slipped and was pulling on scar tissue. The surgeon said shunts don't do that before the surgery and after returned and said no that theory was probably correct. I commend the honesty but it just shows know one knows everything, it may be their specialty but its our pain and it is a peice of engineering invented by a plumber.\n\n It wasn't until post surgery that I realised that I couldn't remember the last time I hadn't had a headache\n\nTrigger now\n\ntowards the end of those six months every time I was 'better' I thought if I get sick again I'm going to end it because I can't do this any more. Then when I got sick I didn't want to cause myself more pain and also couldn't be bothered to do it when I could barely balance on my feet so I didn't and when I got 'better' I hoped it wouldn't happen again. So that became a cycle. \n\nNow when I get headaches I become incredibly anxous which leads to worse headache. It doesn't help that I'm now not allowed to be sick or my dad gets anxous/angry that im getting like THAT again which only makes me think about it more. Recently I've had a fair few headaches which I'm sure are nothing. But I had a seizure (no prior history) after two days of sevear headaches which I think is related more to the anxiety and night shift than the hydro but it adds stress anyway. The problem is my resolve isn't as strong as it was at the start of those six months and I don't think it would take as long as it did to get me back into that mindset. I don't even know what I'm asking just wanting to get that off my chest really.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 920, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Trigger Warning my story and maybe ptsd", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ogbkso/trigger_warning_my_story_and_maybe_ptsd/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "BonelessChicknStrips", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1l1zcvuu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1625762739, "domain": "self.Hydrocephalus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ogb4yl/sometimes_i_see_a_white_flash_of_light_when_i/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ogb4yl", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ogb4yl/sometimes_i_see_a_white_flash_of_light_when_i/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1625762750, "score": 1, "selftext": "Has anybody else experienced this?

He had his evaluation today, and boy did he show that CIMT specialist. He showed her how determined he is, how hard he works, and that he really wants to just be able to get up and go. He got accepted, she submitted the forms before we even left the evaluation room. We will be there 3 days a week for 2-2 1/2 hours. And I am just so proud of my son. So proud of me.

It\u2019s 11pm on a sunday night and I\u2019m gonna call my neurosurgery team asap tomorrow about this, but until then I\u2019m hoping  anyone can weigh in on this. \nI had my shunt adjusted friday, felt great on the 5 hour ride home-It was the first time I hadn\u2019t had a headache since the last adjustment- and then the headache started creeping back in. Now 2 days later it feels like something is wrong and if it doesn\u2019t clear up I want to go to the ER. It feels similar to the spinal tap headache I\u2019ve had, except it\u2019s not positional, it\u2019s all the time. Sort of like my pre shunt hydro symptoms. I\u2019m having moments of cognitive difficulties likeIm in slow motion and everything else is too fast, almost like confusion, when the pain spikes. \nThe thing that makes me worry is that... I\u2019ve already been on this setting (2.0) and the same thing happened last time. But the next one up (1.5) causes positional headaches and other symptoms that make me not functional. \n\nI\u2019ve had an MRI friday where I was adjusted same day, a shunt series x-ray and CT. All images look good and my slit ventricles that prolonged untreated hydrocephalus caused have actually opened to a healthier size. I haven\u2019t had a shunt tap test or anything more invasive than images yet, and my NP usually says to wait the full 2 weeks to adjust before calling about negative symptoms but I don\u2019t know if I can wait. I just feel very sick and wrong. I have no idea what\u2019s next for me and I\u2019m worrying bc the neuros in my city aren\u2019t that great, even (especially) in the ER. \n\nMy first shunt setting was 1.5 when I had the surgery in Jan, then 2.0 in april, back to 1.5 in may and now 2.0 again. I feel like maybe a shunt isn\u2019t the right answer if it\u2019s not working, and then what if it\u2019s clogged or something? It already migrated over my collarbone and is stiff from there up to my ear. It hurts where it goes into my skull, and I\u2019ve felt it move which caused a LOT of pain. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s related to the veins in my brain somehow because of my symptoms, but I\u2019m N.A.D. and my apparent veinous malformation in my brain is apparently benign/ just there/ incidental. Or if most of this is just post-op suffering, but idk because it\u2019s a different recovery than my craniotomy. It\u2019s so easy to worry when feeling like this, has anyone gone through anything similar? My hydro was caused by a brain tumor/cyst last year and my shunt is vp medtronic strata 2 or nsc valve.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 896, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Terrible non-positional headaches after adjustment", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/nu40dh/terrible_nonpositional_headaches_after_adjustment/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LongLXCq", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ck9n4b3i", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1623013550, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ntvmtq/is_it_normal_for_this_spot_to_be_squishy_i_was/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ntvmtq", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Hydrocephalus/comments/ntvmtq/is_it_normal_for_this_spot_to_be_squishy_i_was/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "UIRlVxB_5X_xPPB6BLPvNZaoGglybgVtWRn8nIuJ5Vk", "resolutions": [{"height": 192, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/b66emfur8r071.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fd864da07f4d1d0f8d7da64ca3166275d79aa08", "width": 108}, {"height": 384, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/b66emfur8r071.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76962db154b0eadf543b2a949734bb8ad152fd51", "width": 216}, {"height": 568, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/b66emfur8r071.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=642fce6b7ae81a3a6c319cdf13553d0186ff426b", "width": 320}, {"height": 1137, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/b66emfur8r071.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28b1d0a926dd79c66121d94e47b6a8051794780d", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 1280, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/b66emfur8r071.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=db0e060958bf6337c4e5ea590990f0e02e078ae0", "width": 720}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1623013563, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 896, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "image", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Is it normal for this spot to be \u2018squishy\u2019?

I didn't feel good the next morning, but it ended up going away like magic.   \n\n\nYears pass, I have severe TMJ, my molars wont grow in. etc, get braces maybe to help my bite and stuff. Middle school.   \nTeenage years fly past.  \nAt age 18 i had a great job, a wonderful boyfriend, started not feeling good. a little sick but came in waves.  \nI felt myself get a little more down and less active.   \nMy headaches suddenly got bad. I felt like puking at work and didn't know what to do, had to stop.   \nMy brain was slamming against my skull, front and back and side to side with every movement.   \nIt got so bad I had to lay cushions on the living room floor because I couldn't stand the gravity change walking up the stairs.   \nTurning over, sitting up. Looking at the ground and it rushes at me.   \nI went to the dentist during this time thinking it was related to my TMJ. she gave me a CRANIAL SACRAL message. (pushes and twists your skull around the temples)  \nI felt great then almost fainted.   \nWent to my GP and she said there was fluid behind my ears, and gave me a HUGE prescription of Tramadol. 160 count?   \nIt didn't work. NOTHING did.   \nI walked into taco bell (because apparently I'm a fatass and cant pass up that pity fast food run) and EVERYONE stared at me, the floor came at my face and I saw every spec on the tile. I stumbled out and and put my hands on the ground to help me and my grandma came out of the car.. Why were they staring, what did I look like. I have no idea.   \n\n\nFinally after a month of agony I went in. (b day was march 19, went in April 29)  \nI waited 6 hours to be seen, then had a scan and EMERGENCY surgery.   \nThe spinal fluids spurted out at the surgeon.   \nHad an external shunt placed for days, Then he suggested to do this semi experimental surgery called an ETV. (2012, might have been for him?) An Endoscopicthirdventricularostomy , Memorized that.   \nIt failed and I developed CHEMICAL MENINGITUS.   \nWhite count was over 800. Had to let that come down before he placed me with a ventricular-peritoneal  shunt.  He waited till in the 30's and went for it.   \n\n\nLess than 24 hours after, I was cut loose!  they didn't even give me a wheel chair, nurse said we need to make sure you can walk.   \nI had 3 bur holes in my head, then the one for the shunt. Oh ya, 16 staples there too, almost half my head shaved, but this nurse is like LETS SEE YOU WALK. ha ha  \n\n\nI felt like I was punched in the ribs for a few days, painkillers helped ease the transition but if you cant take them, honestly not sure.   \n\n\nThe after part was a whole new story. Mental illness manifested afterwards and it got messy.   \n\n\nHaving a shunt was a burden mentally. now I could care less, maybe that's my depression but whatever happens, happens. make sure to carry your shunt ID card with you in your wallet. That could come in handy if you are in an accident or something similar.   \n\n\nIt is nerve racking, and I still palpitate my reservoir occasionally when I have a bad headache, and it seems to help. Do not worry if it stays sucked in, Its not fantastic but it will refill. If it does not please go in, they will get you in ASAP if you say you have a shunt and a headache.\n\n  \nPlease take care.   \n   \nand thank you for reading.   \n(9 whole years post OP, no revision yet.)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hydrocephalus", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uv8f", "subreddit_subscribers": 888, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Emergency surgery, ETV, meningitis then VP shunt placement.

I had never heard of hydrocephalus until about 12 hours ago. My mom, 55 years old and retired less than a year after a full career of public school teaching, looking forward to a retirement of snow bird-ing and expecting her first grandchild, has been diagnosed with hydrocephalus. She has a mass at the base of her head that caused the problem with the flow of cerebral fluid. \n\nShe has never had any health problems of note before. A couple months ago, she started to mix little things up, had a day where she just couldn\u2019t stay balanced, and one day threw up seemingly without reason (I can think of the times mom has gotten ill in my lifetime on one hand). In the past month and a half, she started to get severe headaches in the front of her head that she calls \u201cthunder headaches\u201d, and her balance got worse. She went to her primary care provider and they weren\u2019t sure what could be causing it. They referred her to a neurologist who prescribed her a medication for migraines and set up an MRI \u201cjust to make sure\u201d for a couple weeks from now. In the past week, she deteriorated quickly and noticeably. \n\nShe is all but unable to walk for her vertigo, headaches wake her up in the morning and recur every time she so much as turns her head, so she became effectively bedridden. Just before it reached that point, she passed out in the garden and my dad found her, she didn\u2019t know what happened. She had another puking incident. I also noticed her handwriting on the calendar\u2014it has changed from the small, neat, half-cursive hand I\u2019ve always known to a large, sloppy scrawl, gone over as she clearly tried to fix her letters. For some reason this detail was an emotional tipping point for me because it gave me a glimpse of how altered her faculties really are. I begged her for days to go to the ER instead of waiting two weeks for her MRI and finally, yesterday, she did. They\u2019ve done two CT scans and two MRIs so far and there is a 3 cm mass at the base of her head. They\u2019ve given her steroids to keep swelling at bay and will operate today. \n\nI\u2019m still working out what that operation will be and what the options for hydrocephalus treatment are called. I wasn\u2019t allowed to be at the hospital with my mom and dad due to health restrictions still in the area, so I\u2019m getting this all secondhand through my dad. I am thankfully allowed to go in today now that she\u2019s moved on from the emergency department. It is the wee, wee hours of the morning right now, so visiting hours won\u2019t start for a while. \n\nI am terrified that she has reached a critical point and something will happen before they can operate today, or that it\u2019s too late. My dad is inconsolable. They\u2019ve been married since they were 17. I\u2019m their only child and am pregnant with my first child. I\u2019m incredibly close to my mom. We really can\u2019t lose her, we are all so unprepared.
