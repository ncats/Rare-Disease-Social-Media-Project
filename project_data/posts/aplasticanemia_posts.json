I hope everyone is doing as well as they can be.\nI\u2019m putting this out there to see if I can get any useful feedback before taking this to a doctor. General overview - I have chronic, disabling symptoms, have not found a diagnosis which explains these well or comes with any effective treatment/supportive therapy, and have a theory which I think could directly justify almost all of them \u2013 proportionally low cells (pancytopenia) and plasma (hypovolemia). If this isn\u2019t it, I need to be able to move on to something else, but I do not intend on pursuing anything else without solid evidence contrary first. I\u2019m posting this to the CFS, POTS, and Aplastic Anemia subreddits because I have found overlapping symptoms and pancytopenia and/or hypovolemia as causes. If you do not wish to humour a shot in the dark, turn away now. And apologies if it gets a bit jumbled or wordy, I wanted to get it out tonight.\n\n###Relevant History &amp; Thought Process\n\nI had a few symptoms during childhood, nothing incapacitating. I consistently declined during puberty, but still played sports throughout, started crashing the summer before my Freshman year (2010), and had my first tachycardia episodes in Jan 2011. Started raising bed, no more episodes. Started taking iron supplements after finding low ferritin, no more chronic tachycardia (resting in 70s down from 110s 24/7). After this, I \u201cstabilized,\u201d with the same, consistent symptoms \u2013 no cycling, no up and downs, no randomly waking up feeling better or worse \u2013 only an exceptionally slow increase in severity of already existing symptoms, as in barely noticeable except over the span of years. First cardio diagnosed as compensatory for growing too fast and having weak veins. Discovered low ADH and Aldosterone \u2013 hypovolemia/problems with water retention \u2013 and excepted likely as a result of some other root issue. Tried Florinef twice, no effect on symptoms. Here\u2019s to note that I took a year off after high school and was able to walk/hike about a mile a day (good old days!) every other day so long as it was below 60 temp, and improved my diet further. I was already good with self-management and mental health, so just maintained that. I could work within this small margin, but there was a distinct point at which physical activity induced symptoms, and a very short point after this that was impossible to get past and never budged, even when in better shape within those margins.\n\nFlash forward to fall 2015, I was with an alternative/health doctor, who prescribed COQ10. After at least a month, I began sleeping like when my bed is flat, and a few weeks later had my first tachycardia episode in almost 5 years. We didn\u2019t suspect it at first, I had had lower dose w/out this before and the effect wasn\u2019t immediate, but we should have rechecked everything. About a month with worse symptoms, finally looked it up, it lowers BP, stopped taking it. I got even worse for a few months after this, with milder pre-tachycardia symptoms all throughout the day and random fluctuations in heartrate, stabilized again around March. I went to a cardio again and endo for any options with ADH/Aldosterone, his only option was Florinef and I did not opt to try again. Around this time I had read an article on CFS connecting with \u201clow blood volume\u201d but nothing more explicit about what this means and implies. I began wondering. Blood draws test everything by proportions or counts relative to a certain total volume of blood, obviously. If the plasma is significantly low, as we thought I had, wouldn\u2019t that skew counts in favor of high, even out of range, blood cells? Maybe plasma is low but not significant enough to do this? Or, hypothetically, if blood plasma and cells were proportionally low to each other, nothing could show out of range? I figured based on my symptoms, the last question might be important. So I asked both these doctors if there was any chance of anemia. They both said, absolutely not, \u201cbecause your CBC is normal.\u201d I had a vague memory of cell production from undifferentiated cells in the bone marrow from school, and figured if things could be proportionally low this might be the best explanation of how they would get that way. I probably got in some mumbling about \u201cproportions;\u201d it was not an effective tactic and the same answer was repeated incredulously.\n\nSo I had this bugging me for a few months. Some of the CFS and POTS websites were recommending saline IVs, and I remembered how much better I felt after them in the hospital in 2011, even though I hadn\u2019t considered it before. I had the opportunity to get one while traveling through an area with a clinic in March when I had already started feeling better. It did give me an energy boost, but the one thing I did not expect was how unbelievably relaxed I felt physically through my body and sleepy in a good way. If you had told me that I was tense enough to feel that relaxed I wouldn\u2019t have believed it. It lasted a couple days, but as it wore off I started feeling more and more tense. As in strained throughout my body, especially in my arms and legs, but not in my muscles, more internally. I love a good stretch and can get my muscles super relaxed which feels great, but even then the tenseness doesn\u2019t alleviate. The only thing I could think to explain this was compensatory vasoconstriction, or something to do with always being able to feel my heartbeat everywhere. Then I found some websites about radioactive blood tracing (like this one: http://www.daxor.com/healthcare-professionals/indications/ or https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/16793-blood-volume-testing) which can test for absolute blood volume with specification for volume of plasma vs cells. Also, there was an article implicating this in CFS and POTS, specifically proportional lowness in one and skewed in the other (I can\u2019t find it now). Just within the past fall/winter, I actually found one article that references a study and explicitly states anemia (not directly stating pancytopenia) as a factor in CFS. I had an appointment scheduled over summer 2016. Shortly before, my mother got cold feet about the radioactivity and whether, with my swollen lymph nodes, that it might get stuck or something, and that even if I did have both low that something else was causing it anyways and to wait on it. I accepted this. I don\u2019t believe this was a good decision.\n\nJan 2017 (January\u2019s a real bastard?), I had been taking some herbals, and had my first full on tachycardia episode since Nov 2015. Also felt drowsy for the first time starting a few days before, as in what I imagine someone trying to chloroform you feels like, not sleepy/tired or like passing out, drowsy. Looked them up, most were vasodilators or diuretics. Stopped taking them. Mostly stable by the summer, but heartrate was still a bit elevated and fluctuating and my energy was worse than before. Fall 2017, I\u2019m in the northwest USA, first time experiencing wildfires, the smoke made me tachycardic with exposure and with how concentrated it was. I had lower energy and was out of breath walking down stairs, would have a few moments of pre-tachycardia symptoms and increase heartrate, like a mini version of a full episode. In December, I had been having difficulty falling asleep for a few weeks, which I generally don\u2019t. I thought my heartrate was in the 100s, maybe 110s, I finally measured and it was 120s-130s. In general, I couldn\u2019t feel it as distinctly as usual, therefore the off predictions. Went in for a saline (standby order w/ PCP), another a few days later, heartrate 90s fluctuating into 100s. That has been like that until current, and I haven\u2019t had any upturns or stabilization like I have in the past.\n\nThe past few weeks, I\u2019ve been feeling worse. More tired, more tense, more heavy, and my feet redder. Last Friday, I had a mini episode, but I couldn\u2019t feel my heart again even with the tachycardia. It also took longer than usual for my heartrate to kick in. I got a saline, which had only a small positive effect, and I seemed to pee most of it out, which I never though about in the past as this hadn\u2019t ever happened. Two days ago, my upper left chest was feeling tightness/pressure, close to my collar bone. I had a few mini tachycardia episodes, and got two salines. Heartrate fluctuated between 80s and 120s, mostly 100s. My pre-tachy symptoms felt better, but the tightness was still there. I then peed out almost all of it during the night. My chest was tight again yesterday, it does feel better laying down on my left side, and I feel somewhat unstable when standing, which not only has never been a problem but usually standing up is a relief. Today, I kept having pre-tachy symptoms and my heart only kicked in for a little once then went back to pre-tachy symptoms, so I went in for a saline. The nurses noted my heartrate fluctuating very frequently (no movement), but only around 100 and nothing faster. So far, I don\u2019t feel much better.\n\nI plan to get the tracer test as soon as possible. I want to get some solid ground, even though I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll be able to do with it (part of why I\u2019m posting). Although the radiative tracer would be a sure test for this, I\u2019ve found two things that are kind of connected, just to consider for the implications. I know Aplastic Anemia is a specific cause of pancytopenia, but would the kind of pancytopenia possibly in CFS/POTS be detectable from similar bone marrow tests? Where else could the lowness come from? Would any other tests they have be applicable? Also, I read a long time ago an article about an EMT or something who found a way to test for early, suspected hypovolemic shock to catch it before getting worse, as apparently many people were getting missed. I think it was some kind of simple, easily implemented CO2 breath concentration measure, why/how that would be abnormal where O2 is fine or before significant symptoms show up I don\u2019t know. Correct/confirm if you know what I\u2019m talking about, I couldn\u2019t find it. I just wondered if anything similar could be measured with chronic pancytopenia/hypovolemia or in the kind of episodes I have. I know that things like mild aplastic anemia and even stage 1 hypovolemic shock can be asymptomatic. I know children with severe hypovolemia can read high BP as their bodies can compensate better than adults. So it\u2019s no surprise that something less severe and/or more proportional could go undiagnosed even with symptoms. I don\u2019t know what the cause-cause of this would be, but this: https://health.ny.gov/diseases/conditions/me-cfs/ \u201cMany people start feeling the symptoms of ME after contracting a viral or other type of infection or following a change in hormonal status, but experts do not yet know the exact cause. It is possible that the symptoms of ME result from an abnormal response by the immune system, most often to an infection\u201d seems feasible. With everything being proportionally low, a regulated/controlled lowering by the body as a kind of \u201clow gear\u201d in response to stress maybe?\n\n###Symptoms &amp; Connections\n\nPrepuberty\n\n- restless leg (fixed after iron supplements, comes back w/out), frequent peeing, motion sickness, heat intolerance\n\nPuberty-now\n\n- no energy: low (less than 10% of normal right now), fast decline w/ expenditure, very slow rebuilding\n\n- Heavy/deadweight/concrete/dense legs and arms: mom found in runner w/ low ferratin (why we tested), now see it in CFS &amp; POTS, also in a girl with Aplastic Anemia who was going over her case on YouTube. I was surprised by the overlap, part of why I\u2019m posting there, but didn\u2019t want to watch more as they tend to get emotional and I find it draining, although I was curious how common this is. This was one of my earliest symptoms. During spring 2010 soccer season, I went in a little out of shape (out of breath, feeling the burn). By the end, I was \u201cin shape\u201d and didn\u2019t have trouble breathing or with burning; however, my legs became more and more deadweight though the season and by the end I was having extreme difficulty runner, my coach quite seriously asked if I was okay.\n\n- Feel heartbeat everywhere easily: distinct in head, chest, and hands; least in legs\n\n- Chronic tachycardia: 110s w/out iron supplementation, after start in 2011 down to 70s for almost 5 years; now variable upper 80s to 120s, mostly 90s-100\n\n- Episodic tachycardia: Heavy feeling more than usual, especially strong in head, icy/burn in head (like icy hot pouring down, but not smooth, almost grainy), malaise/shifting internal state strongest in head, difficulty writing, very cold hands \u2013 increase in intensity until tachycardia 140s+ (never measured at peak) &amp; stronger sensation of heartbeat instantly relieves all previous symptoms with some remaining coldness and cognitive difficulty; sitting up and standing/walking instant relief; Jan. 2011 only while sleeping flat at night, several until sleeping w/ bed raised; triggered Nov. 2015 by COQ10 while sitting with feet down for 30+ minutes; Jan. 2017 by herbals and also sitting 30+ minutes; chronic tachycardia and fluctuations increased with each time, first time while on iron supplements\n\n- BP in 80s/50s during 2011s, gradual increase to 110s/70s, upper number increases to 136-1550 w/ no/little change in lower w/ standing &amp; tachycardia; never dizzy but used to feel heavy headed w/ standing and some malaise before 2011; symptoms not improved w/ increase in BP\n\n- Energy, heaviness, tachycardia: significant improvement w/ cold, altitude, saline IVS, raised bed, sitting w/ legs up, standing and walking (short periods); significant worse w/ heat, laying flat, sitting w/ legs down, standing still, and aerobic exercise\n\n- Sleeping w/ raised bed: correlates w/ end of episodes during 2011; lowering after moving resulted in decline after over a week of sleeping flat; after several weeks sleeping in longer, woke feeling dazed/exhausted, fell asleep w/ flashlight on and don\u2019t remember, feeling too exhausted and wonky to sit up, even though it provides instant relief\n\n- Tense/strained sensation throughout body, esp. legs and arms\n\n- Pallor (friends mother said my lips were blue once around 2010/11), easily visible bright blue veins across chest and upper thighs (part of pallor?), red/puffy feet, darkish tint in toes, red &amp; white lattice patterns on legs, feet, and hands w/ standing, heat, and episodes; all worse the past few years, legs used to just get red w/out the pattern\n\n- Petechiae spots: ton of tiny ones all over lower arms, some on upper arms to stomach\n\n- Swollen lymphs in neck: connection w/ circulatory system = less fluid through cause?\n\n- Thick mucous in nose &amp; throat (doesn\u2019t seem to be more, just thicker): also from^?\n\n- Sore joints, most in neck &amp; knees: also from^?\n\n- Temp deregulation: normal temp. is slightly low (upper 97s), luke cool/warm feeling, easily but consistently and steadily overheat w/ anything above cool (as in just warm will eventually make me overheat) in ambient temp. or hot clothing \u2013 could this be a similar effect that the specific heat of water has on desert vs maritime climates? As in normal people are maritime and I\u2019m a desert? I also quite easily cool back down so long as I\u2019m exposed to something cold. Back when I could do mild hikes and got overheated I would lay on a cool rock and go back to normal (and eliminate any exacerbation of energy/heaviness/tachycardia). I know people who are hypothyroid, they are just straight up cold, people w/ hormonal, which fluctuate from internal factors, and people who are more sensitive, which don\u2019t have the level of predictability and consistency, and most don\u2019t have such a low threshold.\n\n- Easy bruising: Also, when I do get bruised and am aware when it happens, it\u2019s very sensitive, like I\u2019m bruising something that\u2019s already bruised\n\n- Static shock\n\n- Poor circulation: legs/arms go numb w/out being in odd positions\n\n- Cognitive dysfunction: brain fog, difficulty with memory, words, any kind of specificity \n\n- Chest tightness in upper left (mine) chest near collarbone as of two days ago: poor circulation?\n\n- Since we are talking about blood, I figured my cycles are relevant. I started in 2012 with no negative symptoms. Always been light \u2013 5 days, last 3 spotting, first 2 could get away with probably only two light pads per day. Perfectly regular. Over the years, I started getting moderate cramps (none when I had saline before \u2013 not intended), then worse heavy/energy around the start, then night sweats. My temperature will get colder before I start, but I\u2019ve found at night if I don\u2019t get warm enough for a couple nights before I start, I\u2019ll keep getting night sweats and it will start latter. It feels like my body is having to gear up for it. Also, when I was already feeling bad from the smoke last fall, my period during the time I was feeling worse seems to be what triggered the 120s-130s tachycardia. A few other times my cycles have really wiped me out, generally when I\u2019ve already been worse.\n\n- Also, with infection susceptibility, I\u2019m somewhat resistant to getting colds, but when I do I\u2019ll go through the normal \u201cgetting worse then getting over it\u201d days, but instead of shaking it entirely I\u2019ll still have mild symptoms that drag out for weeks.\n\n\n###Labs/Levels\n\n- Low ADH\n- Low Aldosterone (Florinef twice, no effect), Normal Renin\n- Low Ferratin\n- Low Alkaline Phosphatase (usually)\n- High B12\n- High TSH (Taking thyroid gets into range w/out feeling anything better or worse, found reverse T3 increase correlates w/ taking T4, took straight T3 which lowered the reverse but felt no different)\n\n\nIt feels like there is this wall to my capacity, that keeps getting closer, but on my side of the wall I still have a lot a strength? Like for how much is wrong, a lot of aspects are very good, probably in part because of my lifestyle. It\u2019s always seemed like my body was more stable and less \u201csick\u201d than a lot of people with chronic issues, which has always been a source of security, especially when I start going into an episode. It\u2019s only times like right now, where it feels like my side of the wall is not quite as strong as it used to be, that I\u2019ve really been concerned. Right now, I do not feel good. I felt similar after the COQ10, but then I pulled out of it. I\u2019m not sure if my body can this time. So any comments on how feasible this theory is, what you think of its application to CFS/POTS and my case, any other testing, any treatments targeting this, any related personal experience, especially the tachycardia episodes and being triggered laying flat (haven\u2019t found anyone with a similar lineup), if you\u2019ve had the radioactive test done, what you were able to do with it, etc., would be greatly appreciated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "aplasticanemia", "subreddit_id": "t5_34g75", "subreddit_subscribers": 37, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "ME/CFS, POTS, Pancytopenia/Anemia, Hypovolemia, Tachycardia \u2013 Connections &amp; Help?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aplasticanemia/comments/8fgkij/mecfs_pots_pancytopeniaanemia_hypovolemia/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1497198239, "domain": "youtu.be", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aplasticanemia/comments/6gm8ug/checkout_this_song_my_fellow_plastics/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6gm8ug", "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "Kevin McDevitt", "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/KMcDevitt", "height": 338, "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZHJbAjvZ5QE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "provider_name": "YouTube", "provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "thumbnail_height": 360, "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZHJbAjvZ5QE/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_width": 480, "title": "Taylor Swift Parody - Good Blood (Marrow Match Anthem)", "type": "video", "version": "1.0", "width": 600}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZHJbAjvZ5QE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "height": 338, "scrolling": false, "width": 600}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/aplasticanemia/comments/6gm8ug/checkout_this_song_my_fellow_plastics/", "retrieved_on": 1500129717, "score": 1, "secure_media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "Kevin McDevitt", "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/KMcDevitt", "height": 338, "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZHJbAjvZ5QE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "provider_name": "YouTube", "provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "thumbnail_height": 360, "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZHJbAjvZ5QE/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_width": 480, "title": "Taylor Swift Parody - Good Blood (Marrow Match Anthem)", "type": "video", "version": "1.0", "width": 600}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "secure_media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZHJbAjvZ5QE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "height": 338, "scrolling": false, "width": 600}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "aplasticanemia", "subreddit_id": "t5_34g75", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "default", "thumbnail_height": 105, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Checkout this song my fellow Plastics!!!", "url": "https://youtu.be/ZHJbAjvZ5QE"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Schwing_tv", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_yoa3d", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561307858, "domain": "self.aplasticanemia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aplasticanemia/comments/c47drd/aplastic_anemia_looking_for_answers/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c47drd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/aplasticanemia/comments/c47drd/aplastic_anemia_looking_for_answers/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561307859, "score": 4, "selftext": "A family member of mine found out they had aplastic anemia last year.

So he got his bone marrow transplant after about two weeks of being in the hospital. His number for his cells did not go up after the transplant. His old cells did not go up after the transplant.

She did a round of r-atg with no response and then a few months later did a round of h-atg with no response. A couple weeks after that she was transfered to a larger children's hospital for BMT and we were there for about 3 weeks-ish when the day before she was supposed to start her BMT prep her ANC shot to 400, which she hadn't been over 50 since her diagnosis. Her BMT DR delayed for a week and her counts continued to rise, they chalked it up to delayed response of the atg. She's been off all of her meds since about 2018 and only goes to clinic once a year. Cut to last week, we go in for an infection and racing heart, her hgb is 4 and she's diagnosed with PnH.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is if there is anyone here that chose treatment over BMT for their PnH? She had a good match base for her BMT and she's 13 now, and I think the younger it's done the less likely to have issue? Or is BMT the obvious way to go? \n\nThank you for your opinions and insights!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "aplasticanemia", "subreddit_id": "t5_34g75", "subreddit_subscribers": 131, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for insight", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aplasticanemia/comments/hw4b7q/looking_for_insight/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "zeshtorm", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8vfv4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1590062470, "domain": "self.aplasticanemia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aplasticanemia/comments/gnvknm/children_after_transplant_a_happy_update/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gnvknm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/aplasticanemia/comments/gnvknm/children_after_transplant_a_happy_update/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1590062472, "score": 1, "selftext": "At the time I was diagnosed with AA, I was married 2 weeks. My wife noticed bruising and told me to check it out, which led to the diagnosis. After a few consults at different hospitals, I decided to go through with a transplant. One concern was if it would affect my ability to have children, something my wife and I really wanted. \n\nDifferent doctors gave some slightly different opinions, but the general consensus seemed to be: in the past, ANYONE getting a bone marrow transplant would be infertile for life, with few exceptions. Today, however, the pre-transplant chemo given for AA patients has been fine-tuned and is less toxic than the treatment given to most blood cancer patients. I was told that there was a very strong chance I would be able to have children naturally, beginning something like 2-4 years after transplant. \n\nPrior to the transplant, I froze sperm to be safe. Towards the end of my hospital stay, an experienced doctor on rotation who seemed very straightforward\u2014not the kind of guy to sugarcoat things\u2014told me that I should absolutely be able to have kids naturally in a few years. \n\nWell fast forward almost 2 years to the day from the transplant, and I found out my wife was pregnant! Thankfully everything went splendidly, and I now have a perfectly healthy 10 month old baby boy who is the light of my life! \n\nI know many people being diagnosed are young and not thinking about that yet, but for those that are or those that will in the future, there is lots of hope for you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "aplasticanemia", "subreddit_id": "t5_34g75", "subreddit_subscribers": 121, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Children after transplant?

forget...  \n\nWithout too many details; \n\nWe noticed [petechiae](https://www.healthline.com/health/petechiae) and abnormal bruising on my son (19 yr) and took him to a local walk-in clinic where they ordered blood work.  The doctor called and told us we needed to go to the hospital ASAP.  Never something you want to hear!  \n\nMy son spent a week in our local hospital where he was given platelets, packed red blood cells, and after a bone biopsy, we were given a diagnosis of severe acquired aplastic anemia by the oncologist/hematologist.  We were referred to a larger, regional hospital where my son underwent immunotherapy using [ATG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-thymocyte_globulin), [Ciclosporine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin), [Eltrombopag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eltrombopag) and a handful of other antibiotics, antivirus, and antifungals.  \n\nThe four days of ATG seemed to go well but my son started experiencing signs of possible liver damage (stomach pain, jaundice, nausea) about two days after his last ATG regiment, which prompted the doctors to stop the Eltrombopag and one of the antifungal meds.  This helped, although his liver recovery was/is a slow process.  He also had issues with the smell and large pills of the Ciclosporine which caused some vomiting so they switched to a liquid form which seems to have helped.  \n\nHe's still having some issues taking the Ciclosporine and has not been put back on the eltrombopag yet (pending liver recovery).  Anyone else have problems with this?  Tips?\n\nWe're now onto the daily/nightly meds, blood tests, and transfusions treadmill.  Rinse and repeat.  And waiting to see if the immunotherapy worked is gut-wrenching.  It's hard for us as parents and I know it's hard for him.\n\nTIA to anyone that cares to share any information, suggestions, tips, anything, about their experience with severe aplastic anemia?  \n\nCheers", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "aplasticanemia", "subreddit_id": "t5_34g75", "subreddit_subscribers": 109, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Son diagnosed with SAA", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aplasticanemia/comments/fg9mnm/son_diagnosed_with_saa/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "oceanbraker007", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5gdkn3ea", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1583545829, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aplasticanemia/comments/feo77o/true/", "gildings": {}, "id": "feo77o", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/aplasticanemia/comments/feo77o/true/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "K_PWI0OdvAyyxHn0lplxnbDy-OvoVrHtYrkSbEpaBcY", "resolutions": [{"height": 216, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/n8gds839p5l41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a20900f2473518c8d699d344aa9740ac825d265", "width": 108}, {"height": 432, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/n8gds839p5l41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30032432136da946f328489cab5e83027faec499", "width": 216}, {"height": 640, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/n8gds839p5l41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cca726244962c39375eaee1d884d4181de12dce", "width": 320}, {"height": 1280, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/n8gds839p5l41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=940b22c29223e7b374aa59180c701c2bbc1e6be4", "width": 640}, {"height": 1920, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/n8gds839p5l41.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5fedde39999ed9bfd46c44ffa28c30cf001b43f", "width": 960}, {"height": 2160, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/n8gds839p5l41.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7db8043ed0ec91a5eb98795cf78a634a586cdc39", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 2280, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/n8gds839p5l41.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=918e264c4df066570272143fe1b8af43d1fcfe5a", "width": 1080}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1583545836, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "aplasticanemia", "subreddit_id": "t5_34g75", "subreddit_subscribers": 107, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "image", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "True", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/n8gds839p5l41.jpg"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TnyBob", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2und486e", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1579477653, "domain": "self.aplasticanemia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aplasticanemia/comments/er4jlm/aamds_opinions_and_interactions/", "gildings": {}, "id": "er4jlm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/aplasticanemia/comments/er4jlm/aamds_opinions_and_interactions/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1579477656, "score": 1, "selftext": "Last year I went to my first AAMDS patient and family conference, near Pittsburgh.

My hemoglobin &amp; RBC counts aren\u2019t great but keeping up and my risk of thrombosis is decreased. I was treated for SAA almost 15 years ago with Cyclosporine + ATG, successfully, and will be staying on cyclo. The AA treatment is doing its job but fine-tuning.\n\nPNH treatment seems to be a bit more complicated. I tolerate the infusions well, and the extended period between infusions compared to Soliris is much appreciated. But it seems I metabolize the drug more quickly than expected and there is a limited window that my hematologist can move the infusion dates around. This is complicated by erratic drug delivery dates from the specialty pharmacy. Is this anyone else\u2019s experience? \n\nFor anyone on Ultomiris, do you still have, or have you ever, had episodes of shortness-of-breath? What about a racing heart?

He told her at her age he wouldn\u2019t advise it. He said it\u2019s trading one set of problems for another, and there\u2019s a high mortality rate (30% in the first 30 days) so they only recommend it for healthy people below 40. She was crushed.\nThe doctor is nice, but after repeatedly having dropped the ball, she knows she has to take her health into her own hands. Her hematologist tried recommending her to triple her dose of her suppressant medication but they had tried doubling it once before which resulted in her white blood cell count plummeting. She\u2019s afraid no one is paying attention anymore. \nShe\u2019s seeking out a second opinion elsewhere because she is afraid she will become immune to the platelet transfusions and she will continue to go downhill.

So first, a list of my symptoms, with the risk that I may sound hypochondriac. I am desperate in finding out what\u2019s wrong with me, I just feel like my body is failing:\n- Night sweats\n- Unplanned Weight Loss\n- Two weeks ago a severe lower back pain\n- One week ago a severe left leg pain (I suspect blood clot, I just dragged my leg at that point)\n- Gastric Issues (may be unrelated, but haven\u2019t had a normal stool in weeks, neither shape nor color)\n- Chest pain and heart palpitations\n- Throat ache and gum inflammation, bleeding\n- Severe fatigue\n- Constant muscle spasms, around the stomach and liver\n- 2nd month with no period\n\nThe first symptoms were the weight loss and chest pain with palpitations. Then gastric, for which I\u2019ve had an MRI with contrast. It showed an enlarged liver (17cm), mildly fatty. From my research, an enlarged liver may be an indication of leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. I then went to a hematologist explaining my symptoms and the liver, and she said that my cbc should be all over the place, which isn\u2019t (the highest my wbc reached was 9.1). But I\u2019ve seen a couple of instances where leukemia could be in the bone marrow and not showcase any suspicion in the bloodwork. So I managed to get a bmb after all. This is the result: \n\nOsteomedullary biopsy of approx.\n9 mm; the hematogenic marrow\nhas lower cellularity (approx. 50%), increased fat component; the erythroid series is normoblastic; G/E approx.\n2/1 matures; Mk of normal size, with maintained lobulation.\nNL to correlate with cytology.\n\nShe did not give me any more details. I suppose they couldn\u2019t find any blasts or plasma cells, since they\u2019re not mentioned. But the thing is that I am 21 years old. With this result, two other hematologists can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s up with my bone marrow. They say I should have at least 60-70 cellularity. The only thing I\u2019ve come across that resembles this result is Aplastic Anemia. I\u2019m at a loss and I don\u2019t know how to find out what\u2019s wrong with me.
