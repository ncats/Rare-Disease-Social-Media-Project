I\u2019m a 24F that\u2019s been dealing with what seems to be lichen sclerosus. It started about 3 or 3.5 years ago. I started taking the depo shot for birth control.

At first it was \u201coh your hormones are probably out of whack, it\u2019ll take the depo shot some time to adjust with your body\u201d to \u201cmaybe we should up your estrogen\u201d to \u201cmaybe it\u2019s your psoriasis coming back and it\u2019s just on your genitals\u201d to \u201cthis might be lichen sclerosus, let\u2019s set you up an appointment with a dermatologist.\u201d \n\n\nI really thought for a period of time that I was just crazy. Like it was just all in my head. I\u2019ve been with my partner for 5 years and just recently, did I open up to him about this. I broke down crying about how I\u2019m in a lot of pain, how sex hurts because of this, how much it itches, how gross my vagina looks. He didn\u2019t know what to say except \u201cwell I haven\u2019t noticed and I\u2019m sorry, we can set you up an appointment again and I\u2019ll go with you\u201d all these years he thought I was going to the doctor for birth control or paps. It felt so good to open up about this issue. \n\n\nTomorrow I have a dermatologist appointment and I feel so happy but also so scared and nervous. What if this isn\u2019t lichen sclerosus? Then I\u2019m back at square one. I feel really lost and unhappy with this but if it\u2019s lichen sclerosus then I have an answer, I\u2019ll learn how to manage, I\u2019ll learn to not live in fear and embarrassment. \n\n\nYou might wonder why I think I may have lichen sclerosus and what makes me think that. Well for some period of time, my pubis mound was flaking (which made me think my psoriasis came back), my inner labia had this chalky look, it\u2019s extremely itchy, sex is painful, when I have fissures it hurts to pee, I have no natural discharge anymore so getting fissures is very common since my inner labia is so dry. THE ITCHING THOUGH, I\u2019ll be up all night from scratching and I know how bad that is but I just can\u2019t help it. \n\n\nI really hope I\u2019ll get answers tomorrow. For the last week I\u2019ve been trying a gluten free diet, I\u2019ve been watching how much dairy I eat, I\u2019ve even changed my laundry detergents and soaps hoping that make some kind of difference. I use Lucas papaw ointment on my fissures, psoriasis cream when the flaking happens on my pubis mound and I can\u2019t even use tampons anymore because the string of all things rubs me raw. Toilet paper even hurts.\n\n\nPlease anyone, if you can provide tips on how to live with this, share it with me. I\u2019m not sure what more I can do. I\u2019ve tried doing research but every website says the EXACT same thing, YouTube has maybe 6 videos of women sharing their experience but it\u2019s like there\u2019s no real info on this.

And it seems there is way more to know than I thought. \nI\u2019m actually really upset that I\u2019ve had this for over 20 years it seems, seen many ob/gyn\u2019s in that time, gave birth three times, miscarried twins and had a D&amp;C. Did a surrogacy pregnancy and had a hysteroscopy. Had yearly check ups.... and no one mentioned I looked different down there.  Ok except one female OB/GYN that didn\u2019t really explain it and kinda freaked me out, especially with wanting to delve right in and do a biopsy which freaked the shit out of me. She said something about no Labia minora and tissue paper skin.... But in my head so many drs had had their faces down there and not mentioned anything then it must be fine. I know for a fact I had white patches in my late teens (over 20 years ago) and went to family planning about it, the whit patches actually Disappeared. But I also know I didn\u2019t have a Labia minora at that time and am wondering if the white was from that disappearing. But I don\u2019t remember ever having one. (I never looked at vaginas so didn\u2019t know what I should have down there lol) right now My clit can hardly been seen. I went to an ob when I had itching down there (my husband actually thought I was cheering on him because I was uncomfortable down there I didn\u2019t want to have sex very often. I now know it was the start up of this huge clear up) maybe 2 years ago and he said nothing was wrong. At times intercourse has felt like my skin was tearing, mainly depending on the angle. But I could still get pleasure thank goodness! I would just tell my husband to change positions. \nSo..... I could have had treatment years ago but now have a lot of white scaring and a clit that can hardly be seen. \nThe reason I was diagnosed was my husband noticed white patches down there. This was maybe 9 or so months ago. He thought it was aging, and even though I wanted to get it checked out, it took me some time. I finally went to an annual skin check and wanted a skin specialist to look. She straight away knew what it was and if two biopsy\u2019s \ud83d\ude1c. She just couldn\u2019t believe only one dr noticed it. She even tested her OB/GYN friend on my symptoms to see if he knew what it was. \nShe gave me clobetasol jell 0.05% twice a day for two months, then I\u2019ll have a check up to see if there are any changes. The clobetasol seems to be stinging down there a little. \nI think my biggest concern is scaring turning into cancer. I know LS doesn\u2019t cause cancer but the scaring can turn into cancer cells. My father died of melanoma and I\u2019ve had moles taken off with abnormal cells. Not the same as LS, but still skin related. Next is my near non existent  clit. And of course finding the right treatment to stop it getting worse. I think my husbands biggest concern is cancer and it affecting Intimacy (understandable, I mean what guy wouldn\u2019t worry about that right!!!!). There has been a lot more white scaring since he first noticed it and my clit has  disappeared even more. So I think he\u2019s worried I will eventually not get pleasure from intercourse. \nSo I guess I just wanted to get my story out there. \nI\u2019ve read about some different treatments. \nThings about Eliminating foods like sugar, and dairy. I just started Keto. Nothing to do with having LS. But I have been eating a lot of dairy. Anyone have info on dairy?  \nAlso anyone had success bringing back their clit??

He has great videos and resources. \n\nHere's the thing: my dermatologist has told me things that directly contradict what Andrew Goldstein emphasizes. \n\nSpecifically, that there should be no gaps in treatment, that LS is lifelong, and they just aren't as diligent about treatment as I think they should be - like they haven't spoken to me about the possibility of cancer at all or even checked me for it from what I can tell, beyond the initial biopsy for diagnosis\n\n\nSo I guess my question is: how do I bring these issues up to my dermatologist in order to be heard?\n\nI'm sure all of us can attest at some point or another that our doctors don't want to listen to us when we say we're having a problem.

It started when I was 23 as a white stain at the tip of my penis. I went to a doctor he said it\u2019s fine so I didn\u2019t do anything. Later that year I developed the same whiteness around my foreskin but with redness and tightness around my foreskin. In February 2018 I finally got to see a dermatologist (almost a year and a half later) after 3-4 Doctors said I was fine (I didn\u2019t have itch or sever pain, I guess my case is mild). My dermatologist immediately knew what it was and prescribed me Tacromlius. Fast forward more than 6months from then and I started to see real results. The sensation came back on my penis, the white thick skin was almost completely gone (it\u2019s still white on the left side of my foreskin) the pain went away and I was able to stretch my foreskin so it could go back further. I can\u2019t remember when I stopped taking the ointment but recently i believe I have had flare ups. My foreskin is sore when retracting it once I have an erection the redness is there after disappearing for a while. As many of you know this is also a mental disease and I have been tripping out over it the last month which has caused me to come here after reading all of the posts. I am going to continue with my ointment in hopes it can fully clear it (I was doing so well before I stopped). But in the back of my head I\u2019ve thought about circumcisions. I want to keep my foreskin but where it\u2019s located I believe a circumcision will fix my issues. I just wanna know if anyone has experience with a circumcision as an adult to remedy LS. I\u2019m overweight (have been for 9 years) as well and I think that\u2019s a cause for it too I am currently doing my best to lose weight and return my body to its normal state. Basically long story short it\u2019s really messed with my sex life like I am nervous to sleep with girls and I feel it\u2019s effected my erections (although that could be because of being over weight). I try to remain grateful that I caught it within two years before it became very serious and it\u2019s still mild (only effect my sexual performance). Talking to people about it is great but I really don\u2019t have anyone I\u2019m comfortable mentioning it too. I\u2019m just looking to hear from some people on their experience and what helped them specifically the circumcision. I think the ointment did extremely well and I stupidly got off of it without being fully treated or being as normal as possible. Some days I look at it and it doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal other days the white stains look enormous. Not being able to get close to girls intimately that I really like because I don\u2019t believe I can have sex with them has me feeling very lonely. I have lots of supportive friends but I wanna share that with someone who I\u2019m attracted and not have this on my mind is really what\u2019s messed with me.  I wanna back to before this or be as close as possible to that. \n\nTLDR: I got LS after 3-4 misdiagnosis caught it early took Tacromlius within a year it really helped but didn\u2019t go away fully. Now it\u2019s kinda back again but not like it was before and will go back on my ointment plus things like vitamin D and losing weight.

I protested that it was too tight/not wet enough but again was told \"just put it in\". \n\nWell...as my training to be a good Husband was already well underway...I did as I was told, and \"Ouch! Fuuuck\"\n\nI pulled back to see a trickle of food...nothing major but a clear tear of the frenulum. And an end to the fun that night for sure.\n\nThe next morning I put Polysporin on the cut and assumed everything would be fine, but it wasn't really.  It took some time to heal but was compromised, Often even with KY it would still sting and sometimes re tear.\n\nI have often wondered if part of the problem was that I am a grower, not a shower lol.  I would heal in a flaccid state, but because if the extreme difference between erect and flaccid, when I became erect it was already tight.\n\nDue to the embarrassing nature I avoided going to the doctor and just continued using lots of lubrication and being careful.  This worked somewhat for a while, but soon another problem developed.  My uncircumcised foreskin became tight right at the opening.  Not exactly dry but very tight and clearly whiter, even slightly cracking.\n\nEach time we had sex slightly more damage, and then healing would make it tighter until it would not retract at all and I had no choice but to see the doctor.\n\nI was referred to a local urologist with a heavy Chinese accent, so if he ever mentioned an actual diagnosis I missed it. But I was assured a circumcision was the answer and agreed to the procedure. To be honest, I was always self conscious of being uncircumcised as pretty much everyone I had ever seen in the gym showers or in porn was circumcised. So I guess I was kinda looking forward to my new streamlined torpedo lol.\n\nThe procedure was done (I still get the odd Christmas card from some of the nurses lol, sorry if I don't make light of this I would have gone insane years ago!)\n\nAfter that life was good for many years, maybe even a decade for the most part, but slowly there were signs of complications.\n\nit started to sting a little once in a while again, the same spot, right at the top of the frenulum.\n\nNot wanting to believe I was having the same problem again I just tried to be careful, but more and more I noticed that the skin were my foreskin was removed was slowly attaching until it was attached right close to my Glans, more so underneath so that my frenulum was pretty much swallowed up.\n\nNow living in a different city, married and one child, I headed off to a new Urologist, he scheduled me for a hospital appointment and in-between his out patient vasectomy procedures fit me in.\n\nFirst the needly to numb the area, then as I clenched my fists and ground my teeth I lay there while he manually pulled the skin apart, separating the adhesion.  I couldn't really feel the pain, but more the tugging, and of course knowing what was happening had me near passing out!\n\nBut, for the short term it worked, it healed within a week or so and soon, we had our second child.\n\nAnd...it happened again, and again he pulled it apart.\n\nThe Third time he just shrugged and told me there was nothing he could do and sent my on my way suggesting my family doctor refer me to a dermatologist.  Still I had no diagnosis and it seemed nobody had ever heard about anything like this before.  The internet was in it's infancy, but I continued to search often on line, looking at one picture of a mangled penis to another, but nothing like my problem.\n\nTrying different things myself, and with the advise of the dermatologist I moisturized often and then used over the counter Hydrocortisone cream. This helped with the itching that was getting worse and worse but made no difference in the condition.\n\nOver time the dreaded \"White Band\" began to appear, starting where my frenulum is attached to the glans and all the way around, like a literal white rubber band around my penis. Not really visible when flaccid, but choking tightly when erect.\n\nAt first I could deal with it, it wasn't too painful and things still worked relatively normal, and they still do other than this ridiculous white band constricting my penis by 25 percent when erect. Sex was still doable.\n\nAbout a year ago at a doctors appointment, my Doctor asked what ever became of all that with the Urologist and Dermatologist, neither had sent her any updates.\n\nI told her how he pretty much told me tough luck.\n\nMy Doctor is a very caring and passionate practitioner...she wanted to find me some help...she recommended a different younger urologist and sent me a referral hoping he might be more up on this sort of thing.\n\nThat turned out to be a total waste of time with him also telling me there was nothing to be done, it was not a urology problem but a skin problem with no solution \"If Hydrocortisone helps keep using that\"\n\nSo I felt pretty depressed, like nauseously depressed, I considered that soon my sex life would be over completely and who knows...would this turn into cancer? would I have to resort to more drastic surgeries? Could a plastic surgeon reconstruct the area? I mean if they can reattach John Wayne Bobbit's severed member surely that can release this tight band somehow!\n\nthen about 2 months ago, with me applying cream almost every night to receive the itch that seemed to come on only as I slept...I woke up one morning to a VERY sensitive glans, I mean the slightest touch was like a needle.\n\nAn inspection in the bathroom revealed some purplish discolouration surrounding some white ash discolouration...out of the blue, in one night.\n\nI waited a couple days and no improvement...so back to the Doctor.\n\nShe asked the usual questions about sex and had I maybe been stepping out, I told her I had expected the questions and assured her neither of us had been with anyone else and had not had sex together for several weeks.\n\nShe tested for Herpes anyway to be sure, although she was pretty sure there was no risk of STDs. She also requested an update from the last urologist, I told her he had no interest and at my follow up with her a few days later she agreed and was ticked that he couldn't even suggest a next step.\n\nBut there was a bit of a breakthrough between the first and second visit, I was back on line and finally found a condition called Lichen Sclerosus, and holy shit...there were even a few pictures of that same white band!\n\nI mentioned this to the doctor and she said that the last Urologist put that in his report, that was what he thought it was, she had looked it up and also thought that! FINALLY, at least a name! now I can at least search it properly!\n\nShe sent out referrals to both Dermatologists and Plastic surgeons, as well as a \"Cosmetic Urologist\" who specializes in reconstruction and implants (Hmm...maybe while he is in there he can give me a little more to work with lol).\n\nNow we are up to today, the family Doctor had given me a prescription for Betamethasome for the \"Band\" while I waited for a Dermatologist appointment, and that worked very well, the itch is gone and the bumps of cologne on the underside disappeared, but no effect on the tightness.\n\nToday, the Dermatologist Had a look (I suddenly strikes me that I have shown my dick to way more guys than I care to)\n\nI quickly told him what we thought the diagnosis was and I was there for his opinion and hopefully he had something he could offer for any kind of relief. \n\nI was thrilled when he said he totally agreed with the diagnosis \"That is definitely what it is\".\n\nHe prescribed Protopic which I have applied for the first time tonight and have been researching more and more about its use and results.\n\nThis research also led me to Lichen Planus, which I believe was what happened on my Glans...I googled images and found several pictures that look exactly like what I had.  That has seemed to have healed but has left some discolouration. Compared to some of the images, mine was mild and thankfully subsided for now. I asked the Dermatologist today if the two issues, the white band and the flare up on the Glans was related and he said \"yes, it's the same, they are part of the same condition\"\n\nSo...If you made it this far I would be surprised, even if nobody reads this it felt good to write it all out...Oh I forgot, somewhere around 25 years old I did have a plastic surgeon do a procedure where he cut the frenulum and folded over to make a bit of slack, at that time the problem was pulling down like frenulum  breve.\n\nAnyway, I would love to hear any comments, questions and especially advice if you think I have been given any bad advice.\n\nApologies for offending anyone with my attempts at making jokes or NSFW terminology.\n\nThank you, especially to the founders and moderators of this Reddit!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 344, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "(M51) Over 30 Years Seeking Answers and Relief", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562893889, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/cbpagx/m51_over_30_years_seeking_answers_and_relief/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SimpleWarthog", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3nekqh2k", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562781839, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/cbk42p/can_i_use_hydrocortisone_for_longer_than_a_week/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cbk42p", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/cbk42p/can_i_use_hydrocortisone_for_longer_than_a_week/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562781840, "score": 2, "selftext": "My doctor thinks I may have LS and prescribed me hydrocortisone to try and arranged a follow up in 3 weeks time.

When I was trying to decide on whether or not to do this procedure, I couldn't find any first-person experience shares from anyone with LS who had gone through this, so I am hoping this helps someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some background: I am a 45yo woman and have been dealing with LS for the last few years. I have also been diagnosed with both Graves and Hashimoto's. I have some scar tissue inside and outside my vagina from scratching. About two years ago I went to see a gynecologist and was prescribed clobetasol, and the itching went away as long I remembered to apply it regularly. However, it didn't prevent the burning pain after sex, no matter how much lubricant I used. There was a dime-sized area just inside my vagina that I think was scar tissue - I couldn't see it, but it felt like a stretched balloon, if that makes sense, with no elasticity. That part always hurt the most after sex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarly this year my gyno referred me to a dermatologist who was very familiar with LS, who said that she had been successful in treating her LS patients with the Juliet procedure, and that for the best results I should do all 3 of the treatments as recommended by the manufacturer (at $1,000 per treatment), each treatment being one month apart. It's not covered by insurance since it's considered a cosmetic procedure. Initially I decided against it, but after a few more months of burning pain I decided to just try it, and if it didn't work for the LS, at least I'd get the vaginal rejuvenation benefits! So far I've had 2 of the 3 treatments (the second happened today).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTreatment #1:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo prep I needed to completely shave the entire area the day before and buy panty liners and pure aloe (without alcohol in it). The treatment lasted about 45 minutes. She covered the whole area with numbing cream. Then she inserted something that felt cylindrical inside my vagina, and when it started it felt like it was knocking against the vaginal walls all around. It didn't hurt as there aren't many nerve endings inside the vagina, but when the knocking got near my cervix it was a little uncomfortable. After the first pass, she adjusted the machine, and re-inserted it for a second pass. She said the first pass was more for the surface and the second (which uses a different wavelength) gets deeper into the skin. The knocking felt lighter, but it was hotter and felt a bit \"spicy\" for lack of a better word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, she used a different probe for the outside. I didn't see it, but it felt like she was zapping my skin with electricity and it definitely felt pretty spicy. She also did two passes with the outside, the second being more painful since the skin was already tender.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it was over she applied aloe and told me to use a panty liner in case of bleeding, which is rare but does happen sometimes. I was fine during the drive home, but as the numbing cream wore off, it started to hurt a lot. The first time I went to pee was extremely painful. But a few hours later when I peed again, it wasn't so bad, and the next morning the pain was almost all gone. By the evening, the pain was completely gone. Of course, I was slathering on aloe the whole time as well. The doctor had said that during the healing process, in some LS patients the labia wants to fuse together, so that I should also apply Aquaphor to prevent that. She also said that when the pain was gone, I should resume applying clobetasol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTreatment #1 Results: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI forgot to apply clobetasol, and on the 3rd or 4th day post treatment, I had a super intense episode of itching. I was really upset thinking the Juliet hadn't worked at all. But while applying clobetasol, I was feeling around and realized the dime-sized bit of scar tissue was mostly gone! Like if I pressed on it, I could tell it was still sort of there, but it almost felt like the rest of my skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course I had to test it with sex! Almost no burning afterwards. I was thrilled and very hopeful for the next treatment. Then of course there are the non-LS vaginal rejuvenation benefits. I gotta say it's a nice bonus. Definitely more lubrication, more sexual desire, etc. However, one of the benefits is supposed to be not having to pee at night, but I still have to get up at least once. Hopefully after all 3 treatments are done I'll be able to go through the whole night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTreatment #2: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told the doctor that peeing after the last treatment was extremely painful and only then did she think to tell me to apply Aquaphor before peeing as it kind of protects the area. (I did that after treatment 2 and it totally worked.) She also said that it was common to have an LS flare-up during the healing process. She also said that she could see that my skin was getting more pink (but ideally it should be even more pink). She also confirmed that the dime-sized area of skin I mentioned earlier was starting to look more like normal skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTreatment 2 was exactly the same, but went faster because she did not have to stop and explain everything she was doing. She did say she could lower the energy if it was too painful, and it would be as effective, but I just powered through it like I did last time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince treatment 2 happened today, I will update in about a week or so what the results are.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 328, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My experience with Juliet laser procedure", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562101468, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/c804pe/my_experience_with_juliet_laser_procedure/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "derpityderpiris", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fwh8yf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561665383, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/c6a6j0/does_anyone_have_vaginismus_as_well/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c6a6j0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/c6a6j0/does_anyone_have_vaginismus_as_well/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561665383, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hi I was wondering if anyone here has multiple sexual dysfunctions.

Side note: I am a lesbian and I have never had penis penetration. \nThe second she looked down there, she started asking questions. Do I have irritation? Does it hurt? I could tell something was off. \nI told her I\u2019ve been dryer recently and itchier, but attributed it to changing soaps and not wearing cotton underwear and using scented detergent. Everything I shouldn\u2019t be doing. \nBut the itch has never been unbearable. My girlfriend notices that I scratch more than her, but I always have. Even since I was little. \n\nI had noticed I have a small opening before, but I figured it was from not being stretched out... for lack of better words. I have also noticed that I don\u2019t really have labia minora. Since putting my first tampon in in seventh grade I have noticed that but figured it was normal. I also casually told her how I tried a menstrual cup but couldn\u2019t get it in there or get it out (she said it could be due to LS). Lastly, back in high school, I had someone tell me that she doesn\u2019t think I have a clit. Could it have been fused over all the way back then?  Also, I am embarrassed to admit this, but I went through an long and extreme masterbating phase... even since I was too young to understand what I was doing. Like constantly rubbing it through my clothes. You can judge me. Could that have irritated it and caused this? I didn\u2019t tell my gyno about that period of my life, but I was wondering if that could have irritated it? \n\nAnyway, she scared me a little. She said she saw dry irritated skin and white patches (which I still don\u2019t see) and my labia minora are fusing (which I thought was just my normal anatomy). I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ve always been that way. I\u2019ve seen this doctor twice before (back in 2015 and 2016) but she never mentioned this before. Could she have just missed it in the past? \n\nShe encouraged a biopsy that day (and wow ouch did it hurt). I was all for it because I trust her. Immediately prescribed clobetasol which I applied last night. I Woke up in the middle of the night itchy. Idk if it\u2019s a mental thing or the ointment made me itch.  \n\nAfter getting the interim diagnosis, my friend came over and we compared the sizes of our vagina (were clearly not very modest) and that\u2019s when I realized how small mine is. \n\nTLDR: I\u2019m scared and feel alone wondering if my vagina will completely close. Will the fused area ever become unfused? Should I use dilators or dildos to stretch it out? Could this be why people have trouble getting me off? I can to myself but it has to be much more aggressive than usual females. Feeling alone and so glad this group exists. Lastly, since I got the diagnosis so young, does it mean I\u2019m going to have it WAYYYY worse when I actually go through menopause and have decreased estrogen? \n\nSorry if it\u2019s tmi!!

It used to, once a week or so. It didn't bleed or hurt for what feels like ages too. Overall extremely positive.\n\nAlso note that I still masturbate as much as I used to (once per day minimum... Dont judge me please ;))\n\nIn my mind, it could be linked to three things:\n\n1. Diet. Didn't change what I eat, but eat every day on a restricted feeding window of 12 hours minimum, up to 20 once every other week I'd say. I eat slightly less than before, overall.\nI'm skinny and have always been, but I haven't lost more than 1-2 kg.\nI didn't really change what I eat, but have always avoided processed foods. I eat them once a week tops. All the rest is fresh, but can be strictly anything: gluten, lactose, meat (rarely), you name it (although I think it messes with my digestion).\n\n2. Sleep. I've been sleeping slightly better for these last six months. I'm a big insomniac, always have been, and I used to sleep 6h on average I'd say, at the time when I developped LS three yrs ago. I know sleep 7h on average, which is definitely not enough for me, but still is better.\n\n3. Therapy. I've been on therapy for years. Even before LS appeared. I'm really not sure how much this has helped but I'm a strong believer of the psychosomatic factor in auto-immune diseases. Also my therapy has indeed been going well these last six months, which has not always been the case, and my general attitude towards life has become slightly more enthousiastic, although I'm still alone and sexless, as I've been since a bit breakup 4 yrs ago.\n\nAnyways, just my 2 cents to lift spirits a bit :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 283, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "An update on mild LS (33m)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1557927041, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/boay9y/an_update_on_mild_ls_33m/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "gillyyak", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_j10b4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1557722362, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/bnyyey/lyme_disease_and_lichen_sclerosis/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bnyyey", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/bnyyey/lyme_disease_and_lichen_sclerosis/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1557722473, "score": 7, "selftext": "When I was diagnosed with both lichen sclerosis and lichen planus, I started reading everything I could get my hands on.\n\nI found an interesting association between the lichen diseases and Lyme disease.

I am very fortunate that I haven't got it on my genitals and it has never been a major issue for me so far. It used to be super thick, white and almost scaley but I was given steroid cream and moisturiser and it cleared up massively and I have not had any issues other than occasional itchiness since I was about 14.\n\nHowever, there is still discolouring there and people often think it is a bruise or I have something wrong with me when I go swimming or if they see me in underwear (It is on my groin/thigh area, sort of under my underwear line so very visible). Obviously, it isn't fun to explain no it isn't a bruise, no you can't catch it and explain it to them. I'm going on a girl's  holiday this summer and I'm starting to worry about people seeing me in a swimming costume and having to explain it! My close friends know I have a skin issue but that's all they know.\n\nWhen I was younger I was given a special waterproof foundation and setting powder to cover the area up for when I went swimming or on sleepovers. I think it was with the British skin foundation through the nhs but as I was young I can't remember and sadly my mum is no longer around to ask how we got that. I'm body confident in everything except the LS and I'm hoping some people here could give me some advice.\n\nDoes anyone else here have lichensclerosus in a visible place and have any tips for covering it up?

It got so bad that I tried using the clobetasol again but I actually had an allergic reaction (intense burning, pain, hives, etc) to the clobetasol so my dermatologist told me to stop using it.

I am pretty scared and need to talk to someone. \n\nSo, back in December, I started noticing my vulva area was just plain dry. I had just ended my period so I figured it might be some issue with being touchy from wearing pads. I have sensitive skin. So, I figured I just might switch to a different type of pads and that it would solve the problem. \n\nThis dryness stayed though and then I started itching down there a lot. So, I went to my dr. He thought it sounded like a yeast infection and I was sent on my way with a diflucan pill and a suggestion to try antifungal cream. \n\nWell, this solved nothing. So, I went back. He decided to do an exam. I tested negative for everything.  Bacterial vaginosis, yeast. Etc. I also expected to not have an std because I've never been sexually active. Of course, that was negative as well.\n\nThe itching finally started to go away and I seemed less dry down there. It's started in again now and the itching has came back.\n\nThe Dr gave me two diflucan this time and again.. no change. Very itchy and I've noticed too my rectum is also itchy.\n\nI am going back to see him tomorrow and I am going to mention LS.   I see no white patches.. everything looks normal. It is just this dryness and itchiness. \n\nI'm completely puzzled and feel down about it. I am 24 and a female. Not on any birth control.

It hurts around my labia and around the entrance of my vagina. It can feel like a burning sensation and sometimes has been so bad I've had to put ice on it after to help the pain. I also sometimes get bad inflammation after sex. Doctors keep diagnosing me with thrush and I ended up going on a 3 month treatment, starting around October 2018. I got a bit better with the occasional split in the labia and didn't really have sex anymore. Since then, I think I got thrush again about a month ago and did the usual treatment and was all good. But I still get the occasional split and still don't bother with sex. The last split was last Wednesday and had sort of healed up by Saturday or Sunday (today).  I've had the issues of painful sex and splits and the occasional (assuming) thrush for a year now and I'm worried it's more than just thrush. I googled so much about labia tears and the main thing it leads me to is LS and I am so scared to get diagnosed! I don't have any white patches, it doesn't sting to pee (however it does after sex), I'm 22f. As previously mentioned, my main symptoms are vaginal tears, painful sex leading to burning/stinging/inflammation, occasional thrush (according to Drs). Does this sound like early LS? :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery time I present to the doctors (incl. two gynos) they've diagnosed me with thrush and I'm honestly sure it's not thrush because it's been going on for too long.

I had it for around 2 years (early 20's male). This also applies to LS for females.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got BXO when I was the most depressed in my life. I was on the verge of killing myself. It started in the foreskin and then moved to the meatus. Here's how I managed to cure myself of this horrible disease. Keep in mind also, that it can come back. You can look at BXO as either a blessing or a curse. I got BXO when I hit rock bottom. Eventually I said enough is enough and wanted to cure it. It forced me to improve my life overall drastically. My mother also got Stage 3 Ovarian cancer when she was very depressed. I think so many of these diseases happen in these very low mental and emotional states. Mental and emotional well being is key.\n\nBefore I go into what I did I want to say this first.\n\nThere is no modern medicine cure for BXO. Steroids only treat the problem and circumcision can only be useful when it has not spread past the foreskin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's what I did:\n\n **First is emotional and mental well being.** Something like this is not always easy to improve, but here's what I did to improve it seemingly overnight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**STOP MASTURBATING.** \n\nIf you don't, good for you and keep it that way. Porn/Masturbating is incredibly dangerous for your mind and overall well being. I've been addicted to it for over 10 years and masturbated almost 1-3 times every day. I dropped the porn and masturbation and mentally I was way different. Way more confidence, less depression/anxiety. Desire to exercise more, desire to get out in the world more. And of course, less inflammation on your skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Intermittent fasting** \n\n Fasting is seen as taboo in the western world. Many people don't practice it. Won't people do realize is, it's a natural process for the human body that must be practiced. A Japanese scientist won the noble peace prize in 2016 for his work on discovering autophagy. Autophagy occurs in high intensity exercise and fasting. This is the process of your body cleaning your body of toxins and reducing inflammation. There are numerous proven benefits of autophagy including neurogenesis, I'll leave it to you to research it yourself.\n\nDry fasting is also important, since it increases autophagy more than intermittent fasting. Be careful with these 72 hour dry fasts though, make sure you have enough fat on you, and stay at home. Look up the \"Snake Diet\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Diet**:\n\n My diet is the keto diet. Absolutely no sugar at all, and less than 20g carbs a day. It's a high fat, medium protein low carb diet. Never felt better in my life. You would think without having carbs you would have no energy. Once you are keto adapted (burning fat instead of sugar for energy, and then eventually ketones) you will have way more energy, and feel less hungry. This is why it works so well with intermittent fasting. Many doctors swear by this diet/lifestyle to  HEAVILY reduce inflammation which is the root cause of many diseases. I exercise with cardio/weights everyday and I'm gaining muscle faster than ever have before. This is caused by HGH (human growth hormone) When you fast, your HGH increases by almost 2000%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also eat only one meal a day (OMAD). But you don't have to do that. Start slow with 16 hours fasting and a 8 hour window of eating, eventually moving to 18/6 and than OMAD if you can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Topical Treatments:**\n\nI applied coconut oil to help stretch because BXO gave me phimosis. I then applied DSMO and Tea Tree Oil. Now, these are incredibly potent depending on the purity. The role of DSMO is to penetrate the skin so the TTO can go deep and work it's magic. I mixed the DSMO with coconout oil/TTO. I applied DSMO directly for a few days and the pain/swelling was unbearable for the most part. DILUTE IT. I will say this though, when I applied the DSMO directly, my skin started shredding in a week heavily. New, pink skin was coming out. BE CAREFUL. This cannot be stressed enough. This is seriously powerful shit. TAKE IT SLOW.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Supplements:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst you have to make sure your getting all of your macro/micro nutrients. Make sure all the basic things like Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium are all being met. These, including vitamins, are crucial. You can get all of this from your Keto diet if you eat enough greens/eating high quality grass fed meat and high quality wild caught fish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only real supplements I take would be turkey tail mushrooms for immune support and fish oil. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a horrible disease that has plagued my life with depression, anxiety and basically destroyed my social life. Again, it's how you look at it. You can either treat it with steroids for the rest of your life or improve your life overall drastically and beat it. Like I said before, you can look at it as either a blessing in disguise or a curse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinal note; HAVE PATIENCE. This will not be cured in weeks or months if you had it for a while. It can take years. But if you practice all of these methods your chances will be way higher than someone who is just using one method.

I'm not asking for sympathy for myself or her. I'm not asking to figure out what sexual positions are best or how to be involved. \n\nI'll apologize in advanced for the rambling. I'm just a bit distraught as I can tell this is now effecting our relationship. I'm hoping to help others find support in my position.\n\nI'm more concerned about our relationship health. I've been lurking on reddit and a few other sites since her diagnoses and waited to start asking more specific questions after her biopsy was preformed. \n\nI'm looking for someone who is in a relationship, where their partner has the condition. It's a perspective I'm struggling to find.\n\nI love my wife. Shes my world. We've been together for several years now. I am used to being a very protective, understanding and supportive husband. I have zero wish to leave her over this at all.\n\nIn the beginning our sex life was pretty fun, adventurous and kinky. Its definitely died down now (it was coming to a stop due to the pain).\n\nWe have a couple of dogs, we initially thought it was their dandruff or hair that was causing the problem as they went from non-sleeping on bed, to sleeping on the bed with us. With a new dog too, we figured it might have just been the breed.\n\nNow that we have the confirmation of what's going on, I can say this for certain.\n\nI'm sexually frustrated. I'm depressed in the bedroom. I don't bring it up though. I'm usually very open with communication, however I hate the thought of telling her. Shes in pain and very sexually frustrated too. I feel like what I am feeling must be a fraction of what she is.\n\nWhen also stressed it will kill our relationship despite what I'm saying. Shes worried if I go no one will want her. I'm not wanting or planning to go. The statement made me very upset.\n\nShes hurting and I feel helpless. I'm (like many in my profession) a protector. I'd die for her. I'm tormented that I can't help or provide a solution. \n\nI'm struggling to have sex even if shes willing or ready for it... I can't get off on the knowledge that she is hurting. I can't seem to get my mind off that fact I don't think shes enjoying it. She's mentioned how Lichensclerosus makes her feel like less of a women because she can't make her man feel good. I think that has eaten me alive more than anything. I get off on knowing she does.\n\nI'm sorry for the rant. I just need to know the perspectives of others in my situation. I'm at a loss on what I need to do. Leaving is not an option to me.\n\nWhat can I do to be more helpful?\n\nTl:dr?\n\nI'm struggling to help my wife. Shes my world but I feel guilty when we try to have sex. I also struggle knowing I can't help her. I want to reach out to people who have good strategies or experiance I  what I'm dealing with. I feel alone and I don't want to burden her with my struggles when it's harder for her.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 147, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I need help, Helping as a partner.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/9xzb34/i_need_help_helping_as_a_partner/"}, {"author": "traveltravel30", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2fn7b2hi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541193824, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/9to9it/oh_my_word_i_found_you/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9to9it", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/9to9it/oh_my_word_i_found_you/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1541193824, "score": 1, "selftext": "Whaaat!

Three doctors later .. being treated for yeast infections/BV/one doctor even told me I had genital herpes (try explaining how that could\u2019ve happened to your boyfriend of 4 years... all tests came back negative btw .. doc said she was 99% sure... idiot) .. I was tested for every strain of yeast three times .. stds .. ALL NEGATIVE .. I suggested LS years ago .. they said I was too young and it\u2019s so rare that it\u2019s highly unlikely..Still this unbearable itching .. driving me mad .. painful tears .. lack of sex drive .. so frustrating and depressing .. finally I found a great doctor .. assured me it\u2019s def not herpes but with the LS not showing just chalked it up to some women just have this itching problem .. and prescribed me Clomatrizole .. it gave me the \u201clongest temporary relief\u201d .. I was ecstatic .. it was better than nothing .. finally as of yesterday I saw the face of LS ... the itching was the most unbearable and painful .. I summed up the courage to take a mirror down there and one side of my vaginas skin was white .. I was mortified ... made a doctor appointment.. my gyno took one look and said I know exactly what that is ... LS ... finally an answer !! Some relief .. finally a route of healing I can start making with confidence that though there is no cure I can find some balance in level of comfort... \n\n\nSo I spoke to my doctor about it and he was very informative.. but I feel like the people of this thread that live with it and it\u2019s frustrations every day can be much more insightful than a doctor with textbook suggestions and prescription for clobetasol ....\n\n\nSo I ask of you ... fellow LS sufferers ... now what?  \n\nWhat has given you the most comfort?\n\nShould I get my thyroid checked out?

To begin, I don't know if I have lichen sclerosus, but I do have an appointment with a dermatologist this Tuesday.\n\nAbout four years ago, my habit of scratching at my groin started to yield skin flakes on my fingers from the left side of the perineum.  This had never happened before.  At first I enjoyed it, but then became worried that I might be doing damage to myself.  The area seemed irritated, grayish.  Sometimes it seemed covered with light snow that I could rub off of me.  Sometimes it actively flaked like if I had a sunburn, and I could peel off the skin.  When I'd shower, the flakes would go away after washing, but would be back usually that evening.\n\nI decided to try to address the itch, and bought an antifungal spray.  The spray made it worse, turning the area red.  It looked like I'd burned myself with the spray, but I kept doing it because I thought if I got rid of the fungus, it wouldn't itch anymore.\n\nUnfortunately, now I know there probably isn't a fungus -- the itch didn't go away.  After I finished with the antifungal spray, there was what looked like a big flakey burn mark on my groin underneath my scrotum, more like psoriasis than the grayish flakey thing that was there before.  I started to apply various creams and moisturizers for the next two years.  They would help sometimes, but the area wouldn't stop flaking.  Eventually, a much smaller area on the other side of my groin that I also used to compulsively scratch started to flake, though never got so bad as the area I treated with the antifungal spray.\n\nI decided to mentally train myself to stop compulsively scratching myself, even though it itched and has itched for my entire life.  It worked -- I stopped scratching, but the flaking still happened.  The area where I'd applied the antifungal spray flaked almost every single day, but the other area that had started flaking only flaked once every week or two.\n\nI don't know why I didn't see a doctor about it -- I guess because it was an injury I'd seemed to cause myself from scratching so much, and so I didn't think it would cause any other problems.  I went about two years going through all the various creams.  Then, in June 2019, I stopped ignoring it and looked it up on Google.  I started putting olive oil on it in the morning after reading about lichen sclerosus, since that's what it looked the most like compared to all the other skin conditions I looked up (the area I'd treated with antifungal spray also sometimes resembled inverse psoriasis).\n\nMiraculously, the patch I'd treated with antifungal spray stopped reddening and looking like psoriasis occasionally, and it would go a few days without flaking, instead of flaking every day.  The smaller area that I'd never treated with antifungal spray simply stopped flaking entirely.  I then started applying olive oil in the morning and at night before I went to bed.  The flaking stopped entirely.  I did this for a month, and at the end of the month the area looked mostly normal.  The skin had lightened after years of flaking and irritation, but the skin was so astoundingly normal-looking otherwise (except seeming somewhat thinner than the surrounding skin) that I thought I'd successfully treated it.\n\nI started checking my groin area every week.  The flaking went away and didn't come back for 11 months, without any sort of treatment.  It still itches sometimes, but I don't compulsively scratch it anymore.\n\nThis past May, during a very stressful time, there was some flaking from the area that I'd treated with antifungal spray.  I put olive oil on it for a few days, and the flaking went away.  There was also some very unusual flaking near the tip of my penis that May, along with a few raised bumps that I thought were the beginning of warts, all of which disappeared within two weeks.\n\nSo, since May, there's been one other incident when the area I'd treated with antifungal medicine started flaking, but also two incidents when the area surrounding my anus turned entirely red and was irritated, but didn't flake.  The anus rash went away pretty quickly both times, but I started putting olive oil all over the area as a precaution.\n\nUnfortunately, next to the patch that I'd treated with antifungal medicine, on Sept 30th I noticed a growth with a scabbed center toward my leg.  I tried to pop it, put warm compresses on it, put olive oil on it, but it's been the same for a month and a half now.  Yesterday I saw a doctor about it.  She told me I have to go to a dermatologist, who's probably going to have to biopsy it.  Her guess is a cyst in a hair follicle, but from pictures online an epidermoid cyst, a pseudocancer called keratoacanthoma, and a skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma are sometimes indistinguishable by sight alone.  Yesterday, bizarrely, also, an inch-long line of pigment emerged on my leg next to the lesion, so the area is changing.\n\nLuckily, my appointment is this Tuesday.  I'm also going to tell the doctor about the problems I've had with the flaking areas -- I seriously didn't think it was anything to see a doctor about, since I seemed to cause it by scratching the area so much.  But, because the lesion emerged next to the area that looks like lichen sclerosus, I'm very worried it's cancer, and after a ton of internet searching that the irritated patches were Bowens disease all along, though objectively I don't think something like Bowen's disease would simply disappear with the application of olive oil, like I've read it helps lichen sclerosus.\n\nI'm posting here for basically any information and guidance anyone can give me.  This time around in my searching I read that lichen sclerosus can sometimes turn into or encourage cancer, which I didn't read the first time I was looking up information.  Has anyone had experience of this?  The perineum groin area seems like an unusual place for lichen sclerosus in a male, but I did used to scratch the area religiously, sometimes till I scratched into the skin and bled.  The area's never bled by itself though.\n\nThank you for any responses.  I'm sure the dermatologist is going to be able to answer my questions, but if this sounds like anything anyone on here has gone through, I'd love to hear from you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 920, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Searching for answers", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/jt2dqo/searching_for_answers/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ymgp", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5k54bequ", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605197694, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/jsxf6q/sharing_my_biopsy_experience_f_in_20s/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jsxf6q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/jsxf6q/sharing_my_biopsy_experience_f_in_20s/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1605197705, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone!

There was literally nothing there ever, and I just thought this was my normal. Everyone is different.\n\nLast year I started getting symptoms of itching/burning vulva and urethra. As well as frequent urination. I started to investigate by visiting multiple urologists because my family doctor thought my urethral caruncle was causing all these symptoms. I went through a cystoscopy, everything was normal. I was constantly told I had IC, until one urologist told me that\u2019s not what it was, but never really told me how to fix the problem.\n\nI pushed to see a gynaecologist. I was swabbed for yeast, and STIs at the clinic \u2014 all normal. When I saw the gynaecologist he immediate reaction when she looked at me was \u2018OH DEAR!\u2019 But I knew exactly why she had that reaction. I knew I didn\u2019t have a labia minora, and no one ever had concern about it my entire 13 years of having Pap smears. I recall being a child, getting my first period, losing my virginity \u2014 all this time I never had an inner labia. I even asked my ex boyfriend from when I was 17 about it. He told me I never had one. \n\nSo I\u2019m curious to know \u2014 have any ladies out there who have lost their labia minora to LS \u2014 how does it look? There are literally no signs on me that I ever had a labia minora. I have a small clitoral hood, but no bumps or lines that indicate that I ever had any lips. Is it quite possible that I was born this way? Or did LS take away my lips as an infant? I\u2019m just totally confused. I just don\u2019t understand how someone can base my diagnoses on how my labia looks after seeing it for the first time, and adding in my symptoms into the mix. Who\u2019se to say it\u2019s not just cytolytic vaginosis, an deeper infection that needs other testing or anything else like that?\n\nI\u2019ve done a biopsy and it could take up to 3 months for me to get results. I feel like I am still struggling to find relief, that my discharge has changed and something else might be to blame. I just can\u2019t stand living in this discomfort and getting dismissed when I ask for further testing in the meantime. I can\u2019t sleep at night over this.\n\nI would simply like to know if there are others that have gone through the same experience as me. Never actually having an inner labia vs losing their inner labia? I\u2019ve seen plenty of ladies that naturally don\u2019t have an inner labia either. I know everyone is different, and this just makes it so much harder to get help and find clarity.\n\nThanks for sticking around if you\u2019ve read all of this. \ud83d\udc9e", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 908, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Disappearing labia minora, or was it just never there to begin with?

help me out! I\u2019ve had an itchy labia for weeks now. My vulva does not itch. Neither does the vaginal canal. Discharge is odourless. I noticed alot of tiny flaky dead skin cells around the folds between the inner and outer labia. I\u2019ve been using Clotrimazole 1.0% and Flucanazole alternately but they don\u2019t seem to be helping. The only remedy that somewhat suppresses the itch is Tea tree oil. But I don\u2019t want to keep using it since it dries out the area. I\u2019ve also been experiencing some rectal itching. Did a rectal swab and it revealed an overgrowth of Staph and a gram negative bacteria. (But my doctor thinks this is normal?) Vaginal swab came back negative for yeast and BV. I guess my question is does LS cause flaky skin?

Although I've had irritation for a few years I only realised something was definitely wrong when the white patches on my foreskin and glans appeared this year. My foreskin luckily isn't tight at all and remains very movable as it has always been (I have a lot of foreskin honestly) although there is red swelling at the frenulum and around the very tip and erections are a little sore. \n\nI've been started on Clobetasol and 2 weeks in haven't had any relief yet from the mild pain and swelling or improvement in the skin appearance. I've to use it for 3 months though before going back to my doctor for review so maybe I shouldn't panic about it yet. How long has it taken to work for other people? \n\nMy case does seem to be fairly mild overall judging by things I've seen and read from other people and the foreskin being more than fully retractable still is hopefully a good sign it hasn't actually scarred but I am still feeling really worried about what will happen in the future. \n\nSexual activity involving my penis is sore (although not excruciating) so I'll have to refrain from that for a while at least since friction more than anything it seems to make it worse. But I'm scared I'll not be able to use it for sex again without pain or that I'll lose sensation totally because of scars if they develop. \n\nThe internet seems to either say it will definitely get worse over time resulting in scarring, phimosis and inevitable circumcision which I really don't want or that it will likely be controlled by the steroid cream eventually. I'm also concerned about the small cancer risk since there is some red swelling as I said before. \n\nIt's a really worrying time for me as you can probably tell and considering I'd never even heard of this condition until a few weeks ago I'm feeling really stressed and angry that this has happened to me.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading, I suppose I will need to wait and see how things go and I'm glad things like this sub Reddit exist for people with this condition.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 900, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Newly Diagnosed Man and Stressed", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/jk4ubb/newly_diagnosed_man_and_stressed/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "gynecologyythrowaway", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8nynw0u2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1603942447, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/jk2vd2/does_this_look_like_lichen_sclerosus/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jk2vd2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/jk2vd2/does_this_look_like_lichen_sclerosus/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "iCb0Y0IZKKk1Xe1hXuLpEa-EzudaV4zmu7zHUyoVLTw", "resolutions": [{"height": 68, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/EHgi3m0VVdzmc7cuCzjb9Us3qTEvmBRoYBE5yS3lA7A.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3eb8f44d9bb2b65c58eb7b299a6f7573d5986c2", "width": 108}, {"height": 136, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/EHgi3m0VVdzmc7cuCzjb9Us3qTEvmBRoYBE5yS3lA7A.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89d957178ef423b1cc2ec634421998fbaeccbd4a", "width": 216}, {"height": 202, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/EHgi3m0VVdzmc7cuCzjb9Us3qTEvmBRoYBE5yS3lA7A.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2ded8616725f298c78933e8c66aa6b96b06db30", "width": 320}, {"height": 405, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/EHgi3m0VVdzmc7cuCzjb9Us3qTEvmBRoYBE5yS3lA7A.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a14a0a6b7ff276d0547a3e92a30648f42a729c98", "width": 640}, {"height": 607, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/EHgi3m0VVdzmc7cuCzjb9Us3qTEvmBRoYBE5yS3lA7A.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24406c569eb97815f332a3e87640cf9a44e965db", "width": 960}, {"height": 683, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/EHgi3m0VVdzmc7cuCzjb9Us3qTEvmBRoYBE5yS3lA7A.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ceac9a74e290fd49f027397c42b6bf2f3375db1", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 1297, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/EHgi3m0VVdzmc7cuCzjb9Us3qTEvmBRoYBE5yS3lA7A.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=26cf63faa6a48f3b141b4b9aae5cc48ccbf20c7f", "width": 2048}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1603942458, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've had chronic yeast infections and painful sex for over a year now.

I\u2019m 20F. For quick backstory: I lost my virginity at 16 and the guy was rough and it hurt for 2 weeks afterwards. I continued to have 5-6 sexual partners since and it always hurt really fucking bad and I never knew why. The skin at the back of my vagina opening would always rip and bleed. I had no LS symptoms aside from this, but this alone was horrible especially for a 20 year old: \n\nAfter a year and a half going back and forth between treatments (my gyno didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me just tried a bunch of things) he sent me to a specialist who diagnosed me with LS. I was just diagnosed about 2 months ago. I know sex is a big struggle for people with LS and I\u2019ve made good progress on making it not suck so I wanted to share what\u2019s worked for me. (I just want to mention I\u2019m also using proscribed Estradiol and Clabetasol) \n\n1) Positions that put me at a not natural angle are a big nono. This means I can\u2019t do cowgirl/\u201criding\u201d because it will IMMEDIATELY cause me to tear. Kinda sucks but hurting badly sucks worse. I\u2019m still exploring what positions work for me but missionary is a safe go to and so is lying on my back in general. \n\n2) Using tons of lube (but y\u2019all know that already) and going slow at the beginning (you probably do that already too lol)\n\n3) this thing called the OhNut. It sounds weird as fuck but it\u2019s this rubbery ring set that you can stack and put on a guy penis during penetration. It\u2019s been absolutely revolutionary for me in positions like doggie style or others that were painful. It acts as a cushion between your skin and his, and limits how deep he can go if that\u2019s a sore spot for you. It DEFINITELY helps with the pain. \n\n4) Weed balm- I know not everyone can get ahold of this but I\u2019ll apply it to the outer area of my vaginal opening where I have issues a bit before sex. It obviously doesn\u2019t help with tearing but anxiety makes me \u201ctighter\u201d and more tense which = more pain. The THC absorbs super well (be careful not to use too much) because it\u2019s a thin mucousy area of the body. It just relaxes the area and helps with anxiety so I am \u201clooser\u201d in general which makes things go more smoothly. \n\n5) Clabetsol ointment vs clabetasol cream. The cream burned and made things so much worse and my gyno said that\u2019s a common experience so switching to the ointment formula made all the difference.\n\nI\u2019m now starting on taking fish oil regularly to see if that helps. I still tear a bit during sex but it doesn\u2019t hurt during the fact and heals up super fast since it\u2019s not nearly as bad as it used to be for me. \n\nI\u2019m looking into trying emu oil actually so if anyone reading this has any experience with it I\u2019d love to hear how it worked for you :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 889, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Wanted to share some tips on how I\u2019m managing sex with LS :)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/jg5z8f/wanted_to_share_some_tips_on_how_im_managing_sex/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SexQuestionBurner123", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7w2c62qm", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1603347700, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/jfucop/treatment_options_for_already_circumcised_male/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jfucop", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/jfucop/treatment_options_for_already_circumcised_male/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1603347710, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been reading that if your a male with LS you can get a circumcision and that can cure your disease and if not you can use steroid creams to manage it.

(I have read of LS before, but I did not thought of it regarding myself.)\n\nMy background:\nI'm 32f. I've discovered a small shiny white area located above my urethra opening at the beginning of this year, but thought nothing of it initially. Back than I started checkin my vulva regularly due to my YIs and I thought I've noticed thr area growing a bit, but I tried to dismiss that due to my overactive anxious mind. I've never asked my gyno, who I see nearly once a month because of the YIs, because I was afraid of getting told that it's normal and just my imaginiation. I tried to not look at my vulva to much in the last 3 month in order to try to remove my mental focus from my YI hoping that reduces my stress a bit. So I didn't look for changes anymore. I've visited my gyno again this wednesday with my regular YI problems because the office is closing for some weeks now due to vacation (good for the doctors and the staff :) ). I gathered all my mental strength and asked her if she could look at that spot because I'm curious if that is normal. She didn't notice all the month before but she said now I told her, she knows immediately what I mean. She than said it coud be LS, but she hopes for my sake that it is not and that we will observe it. (I didn't mention LS to her. She brought it up herself.)\nToday I have looked at the spot myself for the first time in month and I've noticed that it is bigger and not just above the urethra opening but also around it. (I'm a bit annoyed by myself that I didn't look before the gyno visit because now I have to wait some weeks to tell her that I'm sure it grows.)\nAt the moment the most YI itching is gone but it still itches a bit and when I try to locate that area I have to admit that it originates from the white shiny area. And maybe that is where it has been itching when my YI have cleared up for time weeks but I still had itching.\n\nWhat I would like to know: \nI've read that it is not recommended to just use cortisone just on suspicion of LS. But I would like to try (when my gyno is back) before getting a biopsy. What is your experience with this - did you get cortisone cream before you hs further testing?\n\n(Addition question if anyone likes to answer: Is there a chance that the white area will disappear if it is treated early enough or is that already scarred skin? I don't mind it at the moment, but of cause it would be nice if it would grow healthy again to prevent further problems with my urethra.)\n\nThank you. :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 872, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cortison treatment without confirmed diagnosis ?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/j80d7k/cortison_treatment_without_confirmed_diagnosis/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ellemoose", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wgogrir", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1602207691, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/j7q6va/recent_diagnosis_and_recommendations/", "gildings": {}, "id": "j7q6va", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/j7q6va/recent_diagnosis_and_recommendations/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1602207702, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve just been diagnosed today with LS after having symptoms of really bad itching, irritation, sores, tears and white patches on my Vulva for over a year.

I would like to share my experience so far with you and provide as much details as possible, in hope that it may help someone or to learn something new.\n\nFirstly, a little bit about myself - things i consider relevant to the situation. I'm a 23 year old male, uncircumcised. I've never had any major health issues, have no known allergies, i'm only lactose intolerant. I haven't been much physically active in the last few years. I'm quite an anxious person, especially socially, have been pretty much my whole life and i get stressed relatively easily. In the past six months i have had trouble with groin and back pain and a loss of appetite. I'm also very skinny, it's hard for me to eat a lot and gain weight. Since the loss of appetite i have lost some more weight, resulting in currently being a bit underweight.\n\nMy LS experience started around mid 2019 when i first noticed a change in color on the left side of the glans. At first it looked like a small white spot and i didn't think much about it. The area of the white spot grew bigger as months went by, but i was reluctant to go to my doctor about it. It wasn't itchy or hurting or burning and I was embarrassed and had hoped it would just stop spreading and go away by itself. After around 6/7 months i started to notice some changes to the skin on the white spot, as if the skin in the center of the spot had started to thicken and i could feel it stick out (like a small bump) and there were sort of like tiny bumps around it too. The area of the white spot was around 7mm wide and i noticed a similar white spot with tiny thickened skin bumps starting to appear on the right side of the glans. This was really starting to stress me out and i went to see my doctor in february 2020.\n\nThe first time i visited my doctor she prescribed me an anti-fungal cream, told me to use it for a week and come back if i didn't notice any improvements. Of course there were no improvements, so i went back, she diagnosed me with leukoplakia, told me to use a moisturizing cream every day and gave me a referral to see a urologist, for which i needed some blood and urine tests and an ultrasound of the abdomen (all the results were ok). After 3 months i saw the urologist and he just referred me to a dermatologist.\n\nThe dermatologist then diagnosed me with LS, gave me a biopsy referral to confirm the diagnose and prescribed me a corticosteroids/hydrocortisone-butyrate cream (Locoidon) and told me to apply it once per day in 2 week cycles - use for 2 weeks followed by a 2 week break and repeat until the biopsy. An important thing was to stop using the cream at least 2 weeks before the biopsy.\n\nI had the biopsy around a month later (in july), performed by a urologist. I arrived in the hospital in the morning, on an empty stomach. A bit before the biopsy i was really scared and anxious. I could only take deep breaths and could feel a tingling sensation all over my body. But in the end it wasn't that bad. I was given a few local anasthetic injections in and around the penis shaft, which was the most painful. After that, i couldn't feel any pain during the actual biopsy. I got a few self-degradable stitches and a small gauze with vaseline applied to the biopsied spot, which was held in place by the foreskin. After a few hours i was told to urinate and after the doctor checked if everything was fine, i was sent home.\n\nI was told to use warm camomile at home to clean the biopsy site. I had to pour it down the site after every urination and change the gauze (soak a small piece in camomile and apply it onto the site). I used the camomile for about a month or so, then just used regular water. The first few days after the biopsy were a bit uncomfortable and there was some pain at the biopsy and injection shot spots, especially during the night when sleeping and when i got an erection (night/morning). This got better after a few days/weeks. During the next few weeks i mostly wore sweatpants as they were much more comfortable than jeans. Showering wasn't a problem - i showered normally with shampoo even on the day of the biopsy - the biopsy site was covered by the foreskin anyway, so the water/shampoo didn't really come into contact with it. The stitches i got were self-degradable and fell out after about 3 weeks, mostly on their own - i had to poke around with the gauze a little, but it was painless. It took roughly 2 months until i got the biopsy results and it was confirmed, i have LS.\n\nToday i had an appointment with my dermatologist to discuss the next steps. She recommended, as i understood, some sort of steroid injections. Apparently this is an aggressive form of treatment that works wonders in some cases and almost completely stops the progression of the disease (at least when it's in the early stages) and, as i understood, she has had good experience with it by some patients. I was willing to try it but asked some questions first, regarding LS in general and possible implications. I asked if LS could be connected with the health issues i've been having in the past 6 months (listed in the beginning), if stress/anxiety could worsen LS and the answer to both questions was no. After this, she changed her mind regarding the steroid injections, explaining that it might not be a good idea to take them now, as they have some negative side effects on the general mood and psychological state, so to say, and could worsen mine even more. Since my LS is luckily at an early stage (as mentioned before, mine doesn't itch/burn/hurt... yet), we decided that, for now, i am to use the before mentioned steroids cream Locoidon for 2 weeks once per day, a 2 week break and then for another 2 weeks. After that, i should completely stop with the steroids cream and use just a regular soothing-repairing balm until the next appointment, which is in 6 months, or earlier if i notice any new symptoms or worsening of the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry that this turned out to be such a long post. I now feel like i rambled way too much and that half of the stuff i wrote is useless... I was trying to include as much details as possible, in hope that it might help someone. I was a lurker on here for the past few months and saw some posts/questions regarding things i could provide my experince now.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions and i'll be happy to answer if i can.

The extent of my symptoms over the years have been the white figure eight, bad itchiness, and a \u201cthin\u201d top layer of skin that was easily rubbed away by any friction and caused more irritation. I\u2019ve only ever had slight occasional tearing or splitting. I feel like I basically have lived with years of a constant, mild flare up because I always explained away my symptoms and suffered through.\n\nI was extremely thankful to be finally diagnosed and I was given clob cream for 2 weeks twice a day and 1 week once a day. I\u2019ve definitely started to see major improvements in itchiness and discomfort and that the skin seems less irritated and dry.  I\u2019m only a week and a half into the clob cream so far. \n\nThis might sound silly but when will I know when it has fully done its job. Since I\u2019ve never treated my symptoms I\u2019m unsure of what I should expect as \u201cnormal\u201d during a non-flare up. \n\nFor the thin skin and whiteness, am I waiting for those things to fully disappear with clob?

It wasn't much of a problem, I'd put on the steroid cream and then sex would only sort of hurt and the LS would mostly go away.\n\nThen over the last 3-6 months, it really started hurting. Couldn't have sex.\n\nMy comprehension of auto immune diseases up until 3-6 months ago:\n\nProbably caused by stress or just your \"immune system attacking itself\" (looking back, that just sounds so rediculous... how the body just 'magically' starts assaulting and destroying itself)\n\nAnd if I'm lucky, the LS will just go away.\n\nWell it wasn't. It was getting worse. The roid creams weren't working. I was starting to experience the saying \"it's like a thousand paper cuts.\" It had never gotten this bad.\n\nSo I started doing research about Auto Immune Diseases (AID). I'll refer to Auto Immune Diseases as AID from now on.\n\nPeople who's parents drank / smoke while they were in the womb have a higher probability of developing an AID.\n\nStress can be a factor, but probably isn't a primary one.\n\nI've been diagnosed with AID in the past, without getting notification from those who diagnosed me that it is an AID.\n\nLot's of other weird stuff that correlated with me having a weak immune system.\n\nPersonally, just my perspective - you don't have to embrace this - but from what I've experienced in my life - there is a cure for every ailment besides the physical death. You just have to find it. Sometimes its hard.\n\nI was not excited to have to go through this 'finding a cure' problem with LS again.\n\nSo I spent about $500+ dollars on new vitamins, pure vitamins, supplements, etc. Nothing really worked after about a month. No change. I was taking so many vitamins. Nothing was happening. Creams weren't working.\n\nSo I purchased a book on Amazon with some INCREDIBLE reader reviews about lichen sclerosus. They were so moving some of them made me want to cry a bit, and I hadn't even read the book.\n\nSo I picked it up. And started reading it. And it broke my heart.\n\nI have not felt that depressed about LS, even when I couldn't have sex, when stuff looked 'weird' down there, when it hurt to pee, etc. Reading this book opened my eyes to the reality of what I have, and how to treat it, the changes I would have to make, and how the steroids I had been applying were probably going to have long term effects due to my already weakened immune system.\n\nSo.....\n\nI started applying what I learned in the book.\n\nWhat I've done so far:\n\nOmega 3's, 1000mg, 3x a day.\n\nCut out ALL chemicals from my daily experience. I only use bronner's soap for my body, hands, hair, plates, dishes, silverware.\n\nFor household cleaners and laundry detergent, I use products by Ingredients Matter.\n\nToothpaste - I use CaliWhite chemical free toothpaste.\n\nI carry soap with my in a small bottle everywhere I go so I can wash my hands without chemicals.\n\nI am only eating fresh foods now. No more foods with chemicals. I try to eat organic as much as I can. personally I hate cooking so this is a huge change for me. I need to do more of this.\n\nI don't use the steroid cream anymore. \nSince then, my skin is 'white,' but it is mostly healed. I have to 'go slow' for sex at first until everything is well lubricated but after that - I'm just fine. \n\nThe 'thousand papercuts' feeling has completely gone away.\n\n\nAnother thing that I've learned in my research is that Nicotine REALLY, REALLY messes with your immune system. I had no idea. So I'm in the process of quitting. I'm sure once I do that, on top of what I'm already doing, my LS will be so minimal or probably disappear.\n\n*ALSO* something I didn't realize in the beginning that made me so sad was that I thought this would be a long and arduous journey and that freedom from LS would only happen at the end.\n\nThis was not the case. Just these simple adjustments really cleared up my LS. Making changes will have an effect - your body will heal. So small changes will make also beneficial changes in your LS.\n\nSide effects from going 'chemical free' that I've noticed:\n\nMy Back-acne has completely cleared up.\n\nI have about 70% less blackheads on my nose and face.\n\nI have more energy in general.\n\nThe callouses on my feet are melting off. It's very weird.\n\nMy dandruff is pretty much gone, and I don't have to use head and shoulders anymore. Bonner's Tea Tree soap is working great.\n\nI really hope you all pick up the book. It's really brought faith into my life after being kicked by this horrible ailment called LS.\n\n\nMuch Love to all of you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 840, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My experience so far with LS (and my road to recovery which is working great)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/iu15x1/my_experience_so_far_with_ls_and_my_road_to/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "memoxvii", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6o7sd1ov", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1600224637, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/itnbii/how_to_help_a_so_who_had_ls/", "gildings": {}, "id": "itnbii", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/itnbii/how_to_help_a_so_who_had_ls/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1600224647, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey guys, I am new here and new to reddit so please forgive me if I format anything incorrectly.

She currently uses a cream her gyno provided her whenever she starts to feel like symptoms are occurring. I just want advice on how to help her feel confident about herself and regain her confidence sexually and for us to have sex again because she expresses how it\u2019s a sad situation but overall I just want advice on how to help a partner or how would you like your SO to handle your LS and what things you guys have done to help your LS \n\nSorry for the long read!! \nThank you in advance guys", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 840, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to help a SO who had LS", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/itnbii/how_to_help_a_so_who_had_ls/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "onwardtomanagua", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7ra3a", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1600137595, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/it00xd/genital_piercings/", "gildings": {}, "id": "it00xd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/it00xd/genital_piercings/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1600137606, "score": 1, "selftext": "Does anyone have genital piercings, and if so, how did your LS react?

I had no other symptoms except it turned the left side of my clit almost completely purple, like a blood blister. My GP told me to put Neosporin on it and it healed up, only to tear again a month later- triggering a ton of itching, soreness, and discomfort with it that never went away. Although the tear mostly healed after the 2nd time, it turned the left half of my clitoris almost completely white and very tender to the touch. After 2 visits to a vulvar specialist, I have now been diagnosed with BV and tentatively LS as well based on a visual exam. I've been on \"the clob\" for about 3 weeks now (prescribed after 1st specialist visit) and a BV antibiotic for 4 days (prescribed after 2nd specialist visit). While only on steroid &amp; lidocaine ointments, the discomfort and itching was still pretty unbearable but improved slightly once I started wearing 100% cotton underwear. Since starting the antibiotic, the white area on my clitoris seems to be improving and the itching is almost completely gone. \n\nI have a biopsy scheduled for next Thursday and am looking for any tips others have- How should I prepare beforehand? How should I care for myself afterwards? How long is it before you can have sex again? Unfortunately I don't have the obvious white patches on my vulva so they may have to take directly from my clitoris- I am pretty scared that it will further ruin my sex life and disfigure it even more than it already is. My partner is really supportive but it has already been 3 months since we had sex.\n\nRight now my biopsy is scheduled for 11 am and I have an important work meeting at 3 that afternoon. Do you think I will be okay to attend the meeting via zoom? Should I delay my biopsy to a day when I can take the entire day off and recover on a subsequent weekend? Sorry for all the questions! I just read horror stories of biopsy recovery on this sub while lurking and am looking for reassurance that proceeding is worth the risk of a rough healing process, even though my symptoms have improved dramatically in the last week.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 826, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for tips for a biopsy on my clitoris :(", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ioowp6/looking_for_tips_for_a_biopsy_on_my_clitoris/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Overthinker_99", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_80cfedur", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1599519635, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ioi5c4/21m_ls_experience/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ioi5c4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 31, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ioi5c4/21m_ls_experience/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1599519645, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey 21M here, hoping y'all are doing alright. I am an overall healthy person since my diet is whole-food plant based and do exercise regularly. When I was very little I got part of my foreskin removed because of phimosis. Back to april 2019 started having little red spots and some whitening in my glans and foreskin. Went to a urologist and it started off as a yeast infection diagnosis, tried various treatments for a couple of months unsuccessfully. In August I started taking tetraconazole and my penis remained normal for two months until it got back to how it was originally. Saw a dermatologist and diagnosed me with LS by just looking at it, \"the foreskin becomes somewhat a ring that tightens progressively making it hard to roll back, and causing it to strain the glans\". I tried with two different steroid creams: Betamethasone and hydrocortisone 1% -I suggested her to prescribe me Clobetasol but she said it was for more severe cases, that it would rather redden my skin-. However, she sent me to a second consultation with a different urologist just to be certain there isn't any successful treatment I'm missing, plus that I should go get my foreskin removed. The second urologist that examined me was only sure I should get the foreskin removed, but that it wasn't that serious, that I should get other perspectives on it. Never been able to reach good results with those two creams, got all the pre-OP of the circumcision done but then a global pandemic happened. Lost all contact with my dermatologist and sticked to the hydrocortisone 1% to at least keep it at bay. This was in March 2020. I got all busy with uni stuff and kind of forgot about it, since I didn't experience much discomfort at masturbating (only extra dryness and kind of decrease of sensation) plus I'm not a heavy wanker either. Update on the symptoms: my foreskin has thickened, the tip including the meatus area and the foreskin are milder red and get wrinkles on the glans during the day if I don't apply the steroid cream. Also the tip hurts when I wash it with soap, even the traditional one. I strongly recommend getting the Veritas glycerin no fragrance one, helps tons with the washing pain. But I did have trouble at my one time sex experience with this issue: My penis became numb moments into intercourse, also had trouble reaching the orgasm, since I felt almost nothing when I stroked it. I never lost my erection though. In late july I contacted my initial urologist and got sent to get part of the pre-OP done. On wednesday I will be given a date to get the circumcision done. The one thing I'm scared of is this awful condition coming back someday in the future, as I read it even happened to some guys who got circumcised. \n\nHope I'm still attacking it at an early stage. Just wanted to put this out there and make my story available for any guy who might resonate with this and struggles with the same issue.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 827, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "21M LS experience", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ioi5c4/21m_ls_experience/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Equivalent_Alps2545", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_807p2qm3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1599486152, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/io7n6q/help_anyone_receive_a_penis_skin_graft/", "gildings": {}, "id": "io7n6q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/io7n6q/help_anyone_receive_a_penis_skin_graft/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1599486163, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi, 39m, have had lichen sclerosis for about 15 years now.

First post and I\u2019m just gonna jump right in :) I am a 22yo (F) &amp; have had lichen sclerosus since I was probably 14 that was most likely triggered by psoriasis. I was diagnosed at 19 or 20 I believe w/ a punch biopsy. I use clobetasol ointment to treat it but, will admit, I slack on regular treatment sometimes. I get flares right at the top of my clit (PAINFULLY itchy!), a little bit at my vaginal opening, and then alllll over each crevice in my backside and IN my anus (also PAINFULLY itchy). As you can imagine, this makes pooping a nightmare as I tear open all the little cuts. :( I bleed every. single. time. Sometimes it\u2019s just a tiny bit, and sometimes the toilet paper is soaked in my blood, but nevertheless, always painful. Every time I get the urge to go, I am genuinely terrified, and when I was younger, I even used to just hold it in fear (which then led to extreme constipation lol, woohoo!). Besides sticking to a regular routine w/ my clobetasol in order to maintain it better, does anyone have any tips on how to prepare for this battle pretty much everyday? I have some CeraVe Healing Ointment that I use as the last step of my nightly skincare and I eyed it today but decided not to use it. Would a skin protectant such as CHO or Vaseline be beneficial? I do have a bidet but rarely use it - would that better to use than TP? TIA y\u2019all! Sending you all some love &amp; healing - LS is a bitch and a half.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9",

Folliculitis is mentioned online as being autoimmune in nature (a form of alopecia). \n\nEver since a young age I have suffered from chronic fatigue and terrible migraines. \n\nFor the longest time I have tried to get doctors to link up all of these health disorders and come up with a reason why it's happening in my body. Like most here I am prescribed steroid creams and ointments, and the offer of a circumcision for my LS. \n\nMy health problems have significantly shaped my life and I would be lying if I said that I have not felt held back or restricted. I have often felt trapped due to these conditions. \n\nGood hygiene helps the most - I have two showers a day (one in the evening, one in the morning). \n\nI don't use harsh soaps or sanitisers (organic soap bars). \n\nMy diet consists of mainly fresh fruit and vegetables and organic meat. \n\nI have been following a good diet for most of my adult life, and have tried just about every elimination diet there is with no obvious improvements. \n\nI have been tested for allergies and found to have allergies to various ingredients in common hygiene products (like sandalwood). \n\nMy conclusion after years of trying to find an answer to my underlying problems is that whatever is going wrong is most likely because of my immune system, and despite seeing so many healthcare professionals I don't think I have ever seen an immunologist. Has anyone here ever seen an immunologist, and how did you find it? This is why I'm posting. \n\nI have not ruled out vaccine-induced autoimmunity in my case as I can pinpoint to the year when my body started acting up and it was when I got extremely ill (the same time I was vaccinated). \n\nI would really appreciate some thoughts on this.   \nThank you for reading, \n\nRip", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 813, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Immunology - and first post", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ij1qdl/immunology_and_first_post/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "QEIsVeryBad", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5vqiii2y", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1598674625, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/iim62p/retracting_youre_foreskin_at_all_times_helps/", "gildings": {}, "id": "iim62p", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/iim62p/retracting_youre_foreskin_at_all_times_helps/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1598674635, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m my experience it works", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 813, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Retracting you\u2019re foreskin at all times helps treat BXO", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/iim62p/retracting_youre_foreskin_at_all_times_helps/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TroubledPussy93", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ouo8uha", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1598665582, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/iik21r/perverts_lurking/", "gildings": {}, "id": "iik21r", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/iik21r/perverts_lurking/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1598665593, "score": 1, "selftext": "This is unrelated to this difficult condition but recently I have posted pictures of my parts to check with others if I have LS- on r/lichensclerosus and r/healthyhooha.

Even if just relating to my situation. \n\nLast January I started to notice that I had the feeling of a cut or tear on my vulva. I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time and it eventually went away. I had a baby about six months before and just thought maybe somehow related. A few weeks later the same thing happened. Then again, and again until I couldn\u2019t bear the issue any longer and I saw my obgyn in august. \n\nAt this visit she suggested I had vaginal dryness and possibly a yeast infection.  She prescribed a steroid cream and an anti fungal which seamed to help and symptoms improved. But a few weeks later the tears came back. I tried the cream again and it didn\u2019t work, I tried a vaginal moisturizer, monistat, etc\u2026 nothing helped. This time it seemed worse and has progressively gotten to a point where it almost looks like my vulva skin is cracked. \n\nIn addition to the tears, I spotted for almost the entire month of December and started to notice a weird discharge. Im not sure if I should even call it discharge - it\u2019s a very large piece of fleshy tissue that came out of my vagina. It was about 2-3 inches and white in color, with pink spots and some blood. After this came out, nothing else did. I immediately requested an appointment with my doctor but she couldn\u2019t see me for over a month. \n\nThis week I had a similar discharge. A large piece of the fleshy tissue, this time it almost seemed bigger and I have a weird pressure in my bladder area. Almost like period cramps. \n\nI finally visited my OBGYN today and she gave me two possible answers: \n\n1. She said some vaginal cancers present in this way but she didn\u2019t want to consider this until we got back pathology results. Should be 1-2 weeks?\n2. She said it could be LS (which I had never heard of before) and prescribed me Clobetasol Prop 0.05% Oint 15gm. She said she thought this because the skin around my tears appears discolored. \n\nIn all my reading (today\u2026) about LS I see descriptions of white skin, patches, itchiness, but I don\u2019t have those. I have these tears that come and go. I see other people describe flare ups in their posts. Is this what you mean by a flare up? How did you manage after diagnosis? How to do you keep your stress down? I should mention on top of this that I have suffered with anxiety and depression most of my life (trichotillomania since 3rd grade). \n\nI\u2019m rather frazzled and exhausted tonight but just looking for any help.

Idk really where is coming from but I'm tempted to believe everything is very, very inflamed (I mean, I guess idk cus for me it's painful to insert ANYTHING, but the nurse at PP today says it looks fine and she wouldn't know I have LS, had to be assured by the other nurse that this was diagnosed by biopsy --- obviously I'm frazzled) and maybe it's referred pain.\n\nIt has been kinda crampy but it's starting to get sharper sometimes (then the whole area feels raw af right now) and I'm getting achy pain through the whole area (hips down through groin). This isn't terribly new but either it's getting worse or I'm hyper focused (because I'm distressed af). I've had on and off hip pain since probably the third trimester of pregnancy... so idk maybe it's just that (idk would that be considered repetitive strain?). Maybe it's anything. Maybe it's nothing?\n\nBut I wanted to ask because it's in that area and I've been getting it distinctly along with flares when the LS feels pretty bad.\n\nThey say it doesn't go internal but there's some case studies of at least vaginal and cervical LS confirmed via biopsy (I personally feel is probably more common and under-diagnosed/reported because the redness hides the scarring in the same way that the white flakes of Psoriasis hide the redness) and I've had that tender, stinging on touch on my cervix (TMI, I know, but if we never talk about it... ya know? The fun of having an IUD and remembering I haven't checked it in several years because... OUCH)... so I wonder if it's traveled into my uterus or colon? Not even in a \"it's gonna destroy my innards\" kinda way but in a \"WHY DOES IT HURT LIKE THAT\" kinda way. I don't have periods anymore... or idk maybe I do if a period can come and go (I've had spotting twice in the last two weeks - the spotting also correlates with flares during the most painful periods when the stinging is at it's worst (I believe this is when fissures and ulcers happen, as when I've seen ulcers it has correlated to that intense stinging, can't walk without wanting to cry kinda pain)).\n\nMaybe these clinicians think I'm insane.

My LS is so much better now, with the occasional flare up here and there. I am so grateful that I have a loving boyfriend that has been with me since day one and helps me through not only the physical pain but also emotionally. He has been super patient especially after starting treatment in November 2021, once my sex drive dropped significantly it got harder and harder for me emotionally. I felt like I was not able to form that intimate bond with him and I felt like he was losing those feelings for me because of it. It definitely was not the case though.\n\nThere was a point where we were living together for 4 months because of university (Sept-Dec2021) and I would just be in constant pain everyday. I went into that initial depression of just realizing how permanent this condition is and I started losing hope very quickly. Our emotional connection is so strong and we've been through so much together. He was so supportive and I knew I could rely on him for anything. But I feel like I put too much on him and he is exhausted. \n\nOnce we were not living together anymore (past few weeks) communication lacked and we had many burst out arguments due to not being able to see each other physically in person and me having the occasional flare up stressed him out. He told me he felt extremely stressed about me being in pain all the time and just the amount I reply on him for that emotional support. He is at his breaking point with this and I try not to bring it up to him as often even though I am in pain during my flare ups. He told me how stressed it made him and how he cannot handle it anymore. I've just felt so bad that he brought it up the way he did. Since then he has apologized (which I did not expect him to do because I do understand how frustrating this could be on an intimate partner) and told me I can tell him whenever I am in pain but I always feel so bad so I try to avoid it now.\n\nI do not have many friends to talk to about this because it is personal and I would love to be able to share the way I feel with someone as well as hear about another persons experience. My LS has definitely gotten so much more manageable and I would love to help anyone else having a hard time with it emotionally and physically.

I thought I was taking it quite well, but to be honest I started to feel a bit anxious about it today. Not really sure what I am looking for with this post, maybe I just want to get some things off my chest in an anonymous way and possible get some advice from people that are dealing with the same affliction.\n\nWhen I was young I had phimosis that prevented my foreskin from retracting properly and causing the skin to tear while having sex. At 19 I had surgery to counteract this problem and luckily my entire foreskin was saved. After surgery I used some steroid cream to stimulate the healing of the skin and to prevent too much scarring tissue. This really worked well and for 15 years everything was really good.\n\nBut two years ago my foreskin started to become inflamed. I'm not exactly sure what caused it, but at a certain moment I deduced that I used to accidentally touch the rim of the toilet with the tip of my foreskin. And I always cleaned the toilet rim with bleach. So my guess was that the bleach somehow induced an inflammation. I don't know... But fact is that my foreskin started to get tighter.\n\nI went to see my GP and she prescribed me with a steroid cream (after I told her that had worked 15 years ago). This didn't really counteract the tightness so I was rather upset of having this issue again after being rid of it (at this point there was no discoloration of the skin). Not knowing what it was, I started looking for solutions on the internet, and found that you could stretch the skin (I actually remembered my GP saying something about it as well). So I started stretching my foreskin several times a day and it actually worked. At first... After a couple of weeks my foreskin was \"back to normal\" in term of that I could pull it all the way back without tightness.\n\nBut then the inflammation started again and the skin got even tighter than it was before. And very clearly, I could see dry, whiteish patches appear. Previously I would have discarded it for the original scar tissue of my surgery 15 years ago, but now it seemed to start growing and ripping from time to time. Now it has gotten to a point that the white tissue has gone full circle around my penis, but luckily it's still only on the outside of my foreskin. But it is just itchy and now, when I clean it under the shower (without soap, mind you) it rips like every week. It also started to interfere with my sex-life, to the point  that my husband and I just aren't having sex any longer.\n\nWhen I looked online last month for growing scar tissue on the foreskin I immediately found LS and got really scared. I directly called my GP for an appointment and she confirmed my worry. She referred me to a dermatologist and this morning I got the diagnosis...\n\nI told the dermatologist I just want a full circumcision now. I just want to be rid of it. I fear too much that it will grow inwards so to say, on to the tip of my penis. I know there is still a chance it will return after that, but right now I just feel like I need to get rid of it.\n\nThe dermatologist prescribed me with a clobetasol cream to prevent the spread right now and referred me to a urologist to talk about circumcision. I do have to wait till March for that appointment, so I am happy I've got the cream now.\n\nYeah, so, as I said, I don't really know what I'm looking for while writing this post. I just needed to get this of my chest. I do have good friends that I have told about this and they have been very supportive. But still... it feels like they don't really understand the anxiety I have over it.\n\nThanks if you have read my story all the way to the end.\n\nCheers\n\nM", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1963, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (M36) got diagnosed with LS today and I feel a bit anxious", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/s324el/i_m36_got_diagnosed_with_ls_today_and_i_feel_a/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Throwstotheway", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7ef7powj", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642026236, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/s2irde/male_26_got_diagnosed_today_for_ls_i_was/", "gildings": {}, "id": "s2irde", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#94e044", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "e3274c30-ea6e-11eb-84cd-0edc3db2e3fd", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/s2irde/male_26_got_diagnosed_today_for_ls_i_was/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642026247, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello everyone. 2 days ago I was prescribed a Ciclopriox cream for 2 weeks and Triamcinolone Acetonide cream for my last 4 weeks so in total about 6 weeks. \n\nI have to apply these creams each day on my foreskin.

If it's in my vaginal areas, if I don't have medicine on it will suddenly fare and feel so irritating. That's kinda how I discovered I had a new area right above my uretha, in the area of skin between there and my clit. I put clob on it and within half an hour it was better, and I stopped feeling like I had to pee every 5 seconds. A couple hours later and it was feeling near 100%. I have yet to put it on this morning and I feel it coming back. I also had an area kinda like that between my vagina and anus and with some ointment application, it felt pretty much 100%.\n\nThis has to be related to my LS, I feel, because this started right about the same time that did.

I've used all of the usual steroid creams/ointments for long durations over the years and all of them have had positive results and caused the symptoms of the LS to go into remission, but upon stopping the application it comes back again - so no real help from the NHS dermatologists, and to be quite honest with you I don't think there ever will be.\n\nHaving suffered with LS since the age of 13 (I'm 35 now) I decided to give other therapies a go. Besides the steroids I have tried all of the dietary changes that alternative practitioners like to go on and on about (no dairy, no gluten, so on and so forth), all this did was drive me absolutely mental. I can't say that in my case my LS had any link to my diet. I was tested for gluten insensitivity once and it came back negative. I've taken probiotics for a time and then stopped, and then started again. \n\nThis last year I took the plunge and decided to have a p-shot therapy for my lichen sclerosus. The p-shot is a generic term for blood plasma injections. The treatment cost approximately \u00a3700 (I live in the UK) where I had the procedure done. I'm not going to recommend the practitioner openly here but I can assure you that it was/is not based in Harley Street. The full p-shot therapy is about \u00a31200 but as I have a condition we agreed that I take essentially half the strength dose which is spot injected into the foreskin and glans of the penis. My practitioner had experience of treating LS using this therapy but mostly for women. It took me a while of asking around because there are clinics that offer this therapy but a lot of them are for vanity reasons. It is used to increase sensation and erection firmness in men and is used to treat other conditions like peyronie's disease very effectively. My practitioner said that although he didn't have much experience treating men he had treated women who had gone on to experience remission of their vaginal LS and get them to the point where they could enjoy sexual intercourse. There was an example of a lady he had treated who could not orgasm and these blood plasma injections had allowed her to achieve orgasm (according to him). I was encouraged to say the least and to be honest I had no other options because I tried everything else and I wasn't convinced I should have a circumcision as the NHS has never offered my anything but steroid creams or ointments. \n\nThe treatment basically involves a walk in session (about one hour) - don't have any other plans for the day. You lie down on the table where your blood is taken and put through a centrifuge. Meanwhile the practitioner applies some numbing cream to the penis and you lay on the table for about 10-15minutes while the centrifuge separates the blood and the penis numbing cream takes time to work. The practitioner then came back into the room and started the injections, which is done using a small needle. That was it done. The following few hours and evening were not every pleasant as my penis swelled up a little and the injections hurt a little once the numbing cream wore off - it was difficult to sleep that night. The next day all of the pain subsided. The area was sensitive for a couple of days but I could wash the area straight away - I only use mild soaps so this was not a problem. As the weeks went on I started to notice increased sensitivity in the glans of the penis and reduction in the redness/inflammation on the foreskin caused from the LS. The condition continues to improve and I've started gently stretching the opening of the foreskin (phimotic ring) as I have phimosis which makes it difficult to retract the foreskin without pain. This is likely because of the LS.

I was diagnosed with Lichen Sclerosus on my genitals a few months back by my GP. \n\nI had 2 fairly large white spots that had been around my pee hole for over 18 months and more recently started having whitening on the inside of my forskin which would also sting and have small painful abrasion after sex. Basically it was slowly spreading\n\nAfter reading everything I could online I was pretty confident a cure for the male version was unlikely.\n\nMy wife finally convinced me to go to the GP where they told me what it was and prescribed some topical steroid cream. They also refer me to a urologist for further treatment options.\n\nI received a call from the urologist a few days later and after I said I didnt have private health care they said they said it would be a few $100 for a visit which I was happy to pay. They then said the specialist has seen my referral and that surgery (Circumcision) would be required and a paid for visit was a waste of money and that they should put me on the surgery waiting list asap. \n\nAt this point I said I am not going to even consider the idea of surgery (on my junk) without speaking to a doctor and having them explain to me why they thought this was necessary. I then hung up because I was really upset by the way they were treating me. (Although I had read that circumcision was often required)\n\nI stuck with the steroid ointment for a few weeks and found it cleared up the discomfort however the whiting had not changed at all. \n\nI was told not to keep using the steroid for more than 4 weeks so I stopped and noticed the lack of the moisture layer it provided felt like a step back.\n\nMy whole younger life I had been told to keep my penis dry and washed which I had always done however the penis head is technically a glad and so for years I had been removing the moisture layer from my penis.\n\nThe most gentle neutral moisture cream I know of is QV cream so I started lighting applying it to my penis after showers mainly inside the forskin and under the head. Also, not straight on, just the whats left after rubbing it into my hand so very lightly.  \n\nWithin 2 weeks all the white patches had vanished and penis has never felt in better shape (very sensitive and soft)\n\nI will keep using QV but fingers crossed im cured. Its been 4 weeks and no return of white spots.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to post my story on the odd chance it helps someone.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1921, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Any Males here with Lichen Sclerosus?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/rswxzb/any_males_here_with_lichen_sclerosus/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "KGStyr", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_18zjgt96", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1640884406, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/rs6r5x/period_advice/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rs6r5x", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/rs6r5x/period_advice/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1640884417, "score": 1, "selftext": "Trying to apply clob, but I've just started my period this morning and I'm already seeing it's going to be difficult.

I'm going to be bringing these up to my OBGYN when they come back to the office but I want some reddit advice in the meantime. I would *really* appreciate any response! (Before I start, I do have to say that I have been really stressed these last few days and that it may be contributing to my recent issues/flares.)\n\nI was prescribed 0.05% clob approx 11 days ago. It's done me pretty okay, but I'm not sure if I'm having side effects of the ointment or if it's not working fully. First thing I want to ask is how much do people typically put on? I ALWAYS feel like I'm either doing not enough/too much. And how long do you rub it in for? I usually get a small dab on my finger, put it on a specific area, gently wipe my finger up and down a few times before moving on to the next area.\n\nSecond question is that I see people saying that they use a hairdryer or something to dry it into their skin. I dry out super easily so that's not really possible (im on estrogen rn for AV). Is it okay to let it air-dry? That's what I've been doing.\n\nAnother question. It has helped my vaginal skin be less swollen, less red, and overall look far better than I thought possible. For example, I had a small white patch at the bottom of my folds and that has nearly disappeared. I still have some white bumps in/near my clitoris that are still there, and I do have minor flare-ups, usually at least once a day for a short while, where I feel itchy, some burning/tingling, and sometimes it does look red. These past couple of days I have been having near constant flares (see first paragraph). I get real red looking, that thousand-papercut feeling and I get really small, painful, raw-like areas in specific areas next to my clitoris. I also get a discomforting feeling in my lower stomach. Rubbing a tiny bit of clob on it helps, but it takes a while to go away. Is this normal, or could this mean the medicine is ineffective?\n\nI've also noticed that for some reason, I've been peeing more? In a weird way, I can pee much harder and faster than before, but at the cost of having to pee more frequently. It's kinda like... my reduced vaginal swelling has opened up the pee gates? If that makes sense lol. I wanted to ask if this is normal/you have experienced this, or if this is something that I should mention.

I went to vulvar specialists, dermatologists, gynecologists, you name it - and they all laughed me out of the room. I felt hopeless, like I had an STD, gaslit, etc. But I think I finally discovered the culprit once and for all: flushable restroom wipes.\n\nYou know, the ones you use when toilet paper just won\u2019t do\u2026 it sounds crazy but think about this. The vulvar specialist was convinced it was just irritation and of course this infuriated me. I cut out all soap, all underwear that wasn\u2019t cotton, any potential irritants EXCEPT those because I thought they were harmless. WRONG! I stopped using them and I haven\u2019t had another cut since - it\u2019s been a few weeks since I stopped. \n\nIt all makes sense because when I was away at college, I lived in the dorms so I didn\u2019t have anything extra in the restroom that I didn\u2019t need. I noticed the changes when I moved back home and had fancier bathroom products. I really think the wipes had some type of alcohol or other ingredient that was drying my skin out like crazy. So if you\u2019re experiencing vaginal cuts and tears, dryness or irritation and your biopsy was negative for LS or you\u2019re skeptical otherwise, I encourage you to consider all potential irritants - even the ones you think are harmless - and experiment with cutting them out of your life.

I believe that I actually started having symptoms noticeably around the age of 11 (I'm 23F) but they subsided for a while, and when I think back I had similar LS type pain around my anus when I was as young as 3-4 years old but nothing came of it then either. \n\nWhen I was officially diagnosed, the gyno told me that my inner labia had been completely reabsorbed. I recently had a horrible flare up, that appears to have taken even more of the tissue around my clitoris away, but it eventually stopped and it still looks okay.\n\nIt wasn't until around last week when I got a tear on the outside of my vulva, in the join of my leg to bum, that I'm now feeling completely lost and isolated. The skin fusing back at that point appears to be pulling the bottom part of my outer labia away so that there's even MORE structural loss. \n\nI've been using clobetasol which does help and I absolutely lather my skin in emollient every day, multiple times a day. I'm not particularly active at the moment as its too irritating to go to the gym. I stopped wearing underwear before this happened. I don't put chemicals on the area other than dermol soap substitute as prescribed and my clobetasol. \n\nI can't get in contact with my gyno because everything is done through referral currently with the NHS so there's no email or telephone number to call. My GP is utterly useless with all of my medical conditions, and again I can't find a new one because it's done by health board and they are my GP. I've not got the money or insurance for private medical care either.\n\nI'm due a gyno appointment in January for my LS but I'm feeling really low and alone right now with these changes. It's not the end of the world for me if there are structural changes, but I'm really scared i'll lose my clit, or the opening of my urethra will become affected or if i lose my labia majora completely. \n\nI feel completely forgotten about by medical professionals and I have so many other autoimmune conditions that this is a lot to take on too. \n\nI suppose i'm just looking for more reassurance, or tips on other things I could try that worked for other people. My next conversation with my Gyno will be what she thinks the best steps would be in terms of seeking dietary guidance for the issue as I think i'll need to find someone who can help me find inflammatory triggers.\n\nAny tips, tricks or advice for a very sad and scared lil lady?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1884, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Structural Changes", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/rifasc/structural_changes/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "britnee814", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_e6g0ngus", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1639555656, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/rgu4e2/can_i_post_a_picis_this_lslp/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rgu4e2", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/rgu4e2/can_i_post_a_picis_this_lslp/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1639555666, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1881, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can I post a pic/is this LS/LP?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/rgu4e2/can_i_post_a_picis_this_lslp/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "onwardtomanagua", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7ra3a", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1639531648, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/rgmv4d/bought_a_jar_of_emuaid_as_an_alternative_treatment/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rgmv4d", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/rgmv4d/bought_a_jar_of_emuaid_as_an_alternative_treatment/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1639531659, "score": 1, "selftext": "i am about two months into a resistant flare-up of LS affecting both my vulva and anus. i did all of my usual stuff: started clob, cut out sugar, sitz baths. i'm already underwear-free, using unscented products, the whole thing. i was in remission for many years, so this has been extremely frustrating. the pain the itch;

Long story short, I (22f) have been diagnosed with Atrophic Vagnitis and low estrogen. I'm taking Imvexxy 4mcg twice a week and that has improved some of my worst symptoms such as dryness and vaginal pain, and the skin of my vagina definately does feel softer - and bodywide improvements, too. I went today to the OBGYN because I'm still have some burning and inflamation down there and the doctor told me I may have lichen sclerosus. Looking at the symptoms of LS, I realize that I probably do have it, as I do have some white bumps and skin down there. I wouldn't say it *looks* bad - it definately feels worse than it looks.\n\nI was also tested for all the other nasty stuff such as YI and BV, and I've never been sexually active. For the longest time, I always remember having some white bumps on the inside skin area(?) on the right side of my clit, but I kinda just assumed it was acne that would get aggrvated when I touched it. Now I know that's probably not normal - I also had some white patches of skin near the bottom of my vagina that I also just assumed was typical. I also *very* occasionally get *very* small tears around my anal region sometimes after pooping, but that's usually only with harder stools. Again, I kinda just thought this was normal.\n\nThe OBGYN prescribed me clob to take 2x a day for 10 days, and then to come back in early Janurary for  another evaulation.

It really helped me a lot. Please ask any questions.\n\n\u201cGinny Chandoha hasn't just written a book about Lichen Sclerosis, it's also a book about what we in the naturopathic profession call \"nature cure.\" If you remove the obstacles that prevent your body from working correctly, it will tend to fix itself. The mass of harmful substances that we put in and on our bodies is staggering. As Ginny points out, if you feed yourself well and quit dousing yourself in toxins, you will be well on your way to feeling better. And if you do have Lichen Sclerosis, read the entire book, because Ginny also provides details on how she cured herself using herbs and other therapies. In fact, I'm confident that her protocol will help people with many diseases, including other autoimmune issues. This could literally be a textbook in the naturopathic medical curriculum. Its content is vast, deep, and well-researched. Although I've been involved in natural medicine for twenty years, I still benefit from periodic reminders about how to live well. This book is a strong reminder. I improved my diet and cleaning products immediately upon reading it. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and read it again from cover-to-cover. It's one of those books every health care practitioner should read, and one that everyone would benefit from reading, and re-reading periodically.

I locked myself in my room all day everyday just so I didn\u2019t have to move. I tried everything. The cream, all diets, etc. It was to the point I didn\u2019t want to live.

I never would have imagined finding a sub for this but I am grateful. My issues began roughly six months ago. I had itching, green discharge, no smell, and burning while urinating. I itched and itched until I felt that first lesion. Immediately I panicked. After an uncomfortable conversation with my partner (I thought I had an STD) I made an appointment. I was told I had both a yeast infection and UTI, and to stop itching. I picked up my meds later that day and of course after my course of antibiotics, the yeast infection came right back. I called and got another prescription, but the discharge and itch came back days later. Frustrated, I made an appointment to biopsy the itchy areas and got my results back within a week. \u201cLichen Chronus.\u201d I realize that\u2019s a little different from lichen sclerosus, but it\u2019s in my genital are. I was given clobetasol and was instructed to use it 2x daily for up to two weeks. After applying it for three days, I felt like the itch got worse. I tried my hardest not to itch at all, but I think I was itching at night. This was in mid December. I quit using the clobetasol and wrongfully assumed that the issue would resolve itself if I just left it alone. For weeks I had strange discharge and thought I was having recurring yeast infections. My doctor did not explain that any lichen issues on the genitals were extremely persistent, or that discharge was associated with the diagnosis. I finally found that information on my own, and started using the clobetasol once daily, at night, to not deal with the itching symptoms. \n\nBut then the bleeding started. I itched it so roughly it opened up and began bleeding. I kept applying the medicine, kept trying to keep my hands off it. The itching went away finally after weeks. But now it\u2019s back. \n\nI seriously want to take a scalpel and cut the whole area out. I want the doctor to surgical remove the entire section of my skin. I want to use the medicine prescribed for it and have it help my symptoms, not exacerbate them. One of the main symptoms of using clobetasol is itching and burning. Seriously what the hell. I can\u2019t enjoy sex because the itching sensation. I don\u2019t want him to perform oral sex on me because the discharge. Every time I walk or move a certain way, the itching sensation grows. I\u2019m freaking miserable. I hate this.

Perianal LS with no symptoms, which I understand is very rare in men for some reason. It begins above the anus, goes around on one side and barely onto the perineum about an inch around. Still a good 4 inches plus from the scrotum, no penile involvement. Very occasional slight itching but no sores or cracking, pain etc. Appearance hasn't changed at all for a couple years that I can tell. (It's only visible to me when turned around with a foot on the counter looking backwards) I just brought it up to the GP out of curiosity.\n\nThe Dermatologist was surprised to see this presentation in an otherwise healthy, relatively young male, but said to use the steroidal ointment and it will most likely lessen in appearance. Said if there's no symptoms it really isn't a big deal. \nAny advice on soap? Is Hibiclens a good idea or too strong? I just don't want it to get worse... Is it likely to spread as I age?\nI read some of the experiences you all deal with here and I'm humbled.

I've been to a few doctors and am pursuing a couple of different treatments (including pelvic floor therapy) without much success.\n\nToday I saw a normal gynecologist as a second opinion type of situation. I explained everything and she did her exam. She quickly came back up (haha) and said \"Okay I might entertain the possibility of lichen schlerosus.\" (It was on my list of possibilities when we were talking)\n\nShe explained that there was some whitening and thinning of the skin (only slight) around the vagina. However, what I'm most concerned about is the fact that she also said my labia minora were smaller than expected (disappearing?) and that the skin was starting to cover my clitoris and there was no defined hood. I had noticed this myself a few weeks ago when applying a cream my specialist had given me. She said it wasn't completely gone but when I got home and dug around (lol) I couldn't find my clit!! Unfortunately I don't masturbate so I honestly have no idea if it was always like this. The skin appears to be covering it completely.\n\nShe prescribed me clob and told me it would help. I'm not so convinced, as I've read skin changes and scarring isn't usually reversible in this manner. I'm also confused because I thought these anatomical changes were in the late stage of the disease. Could I have had LS my whole life and not even known it? I've only had any symptoms for 6 months. \n\nBasically, I'd love to hear about anyone's experience and what people might think about the fusing and shrinkage.

Anyways I went to the gyno after the second tear and she said she couldn't diagnose me with LS because of the tear but that I should come back for a biopsy which is next week. also I am terrified about that. I have never seen any tearing before these two times and don't have itching or white patches and have never experienced pain with sex prior to this summer which the doctor said was due to the tear.  My boyfriend is also pretty big and I am very petite. I started doing some dilation and it doesn't hurt at all. Is this something anyone else has experienced with a positive diagnosis? No symptoms other than a couple tears in the posterior fourchette area? I've been really nervous about this for months and its affecting my relationship. My gyno gave me estrogen cream to use and I stopped my birth control (Yasmin) about a month ago to see if my dryness was the reason.

Got diagnosed yesterday (F26). The doctor didn't tell me much other than LS is autoimmune and nobody knows what causes it. I was prescribed clobetasol 0.05% and told to put it on twice a day, but not for how long (didn't realize this until I came home, I was just in such a shock in the moment, I went in thinking I had jock itch...). I read here some people have to put it on daily for a certain time and then they decrease their application. I know it depends on the severity, but I'd like to know how frequently and for how long people have to put it on. I basically have one patch of the size of my pinkie on my left outer labia, one patch of the size of a pea on the right outer labia, and then I have it all around my perianal and anal area. I had realized in the past my butt area would bleed just by wiping with paper but I always just thought I had sensitive skin.\n\nI also read here about scarring, fusing etc. My doctor didn't tell me anything about this at all. Is this something I should expect with time? Do patches grow and evolve? Right now it doesn't seem to be inside my labia but could it get there?\n\nThe last thing I wanted to ask about is detergents and, body wash and hand soaps. I know any fragance free detergent should be fine, but I wanted to know what people actually use. The reason I'm asking about hand soap is because I have noticed that since I have to watch my hands way more often now (before applying cream, after applying it.. Etc) my hands are just getting dryer and I was wondering if someone has found something gentle that works for them.\n\nI will be calling my doctor on Monday and asking them the questions as well, but I still would like to know what other people dealing with LS have to say.

There was one time I got really sick (104 temp for almost a week) and my vagina started to react to the fever and ended up getting a large fissure on the skin. I went to an urgent care to see what was going on and the doctor there told me she thought it was herpes. She did a swab test and it came back negative, I went to my actual gyno took a swab test and also came back negative.  That was 4 years ago and have never had an issue like that since. Then during my last yearly exam my gyno asked my why the tissue inside my vagina was so white and I wasn\u2019t sure what to say because it has looked like that for as long as I could remember, and I thought that was vaginas we\u2019re supposed to look like. She prescribed me a steroid to use twice a day for two weeks and sure enough by the end of those two weeks the tissue inside was a beautiful pink. I was amazed! On the spot she diagnosed me with LS, said I didn\u2019t need a biopsy and I went on my merry way. Over the past few months I notice the white tissue starts to come back so I put some cream on and it usually goes away within a couple of days. I had a flare up again recently which prompted me to do some research and I came across multiple publications saying that LS will never effect your vagina, only the outside vulva area. Now I\u2019m worried that I don\u2019t actually LS since I was never biopsied. And since I\u2019ve had so many misdiagnoses in the past I\u2019m feeling skeptical about this one too.

And I know this is similar to all the other posts so I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m repeating things but I\u2019m struggling a lot. \n\nI\u2019ve had the usual symptoms. Intense Itching. And a few months ago it was more around the anus and perianal skin. I have cracks on the perianal skin and when I do scratch, including the labia, I bleed immediately. And sex hurts. I can\u2019t even think about it. I often end up just laying in bed with ice packs between my legs. \nBeen treated for yeast over and over again. Been tested for all STDs and was even told I have herpes. That came back negative so I switched soaps and detergents and such (was already using scent free/dye free and sensitive skin things though) at the doctors request. No change in symptoms. I went back to the doc and now it\u2019s, \u201coh... I think this is a wart. You have warts. Hpv.\u201d So now I\u2019m waiting for those results (never had an abnormal pap). I mentioned LS, which the doc mentioned a few appts ago, but she seemed set on her warts diagnosis. But confusingly she did prescribe me triamcinolone and it is the ONLY thing that has offered me any relief. \nWould this give me relief if it was HPV? I tried looking it up and only see that it shouldn\u2019t be used for warts. \n\nI\u2019m so frustrated and ready to give up. I missed Christmas eve with my family last year because I was crying in bed with ice packs and trying not to scratch. \n\nAnd my bf is getting upset that they keep thinking STDs. And when the doc tested for herpes, it really put a strain on things. I know he knew it can lay doormat but I\u2019m sure he was worried I was cheating. \n\nLastly, they took a biopsy from the \u201cwart\u201d and I asked if they\u2019ll look for other things too, which the doctor seemed annoyed that I was asking. The problem, my last appt was $300. And that didn\u2019t include a biopsy. I\u2019m really worried that I\u2019ll need additional appts/specialists just to get to the bottom of things and have someone listen to me. I can\u2019t afford these appts. I work for a nonprofit in effing DC and my insurance apparently sucks for specialists/OBGYN outside of an annual. \n\nI\u2019m super lost and scared. I just want answers. But don\u2019t know how to get them when I can\u2019t afford all these appts. And tests. \n\nNot sure what feedback I\u2019m asking for.

The biopsy was painful but necessary. Shortly after, I was diagnosed with LS. \n\n***Medicine for Lichen Sclerosis:***\n\nRecommended by my dermatologist, I have a shower emollient cream called 'Dermol 500'. \n\nThis is to help dry skin, and for use as a soap substitute. I also have a moisture barrier application (vaseline), to ensure that the area stays clear of irritation. \n\nI have been prescribed Elocon, a potent corticosteroid that I no longer use, as it irritates my skin. \n\n***Treatments:*** \n\nI have been treated by a leading dermatologist in the UK, who has advised against PRP or 'P' Shot in order to 'rejuvenate' the skin of my penis.

I was circumcised as a baby.  Never had issues/problems with my genitals.  In late February I developed a small sore on my penis.  About 1/2\" round.  Slightly reddish, like inflamed, but no bleeding, oozing, etc.  Some days it would have a small whitehead in the middle... other days the whitehead would go away.  Tried steroids on it for several weeks with no help.  After 9 weeks my dermatologist decided to do a biopsy.\n\nDuring that 9 weeks the only real negative was the warming pain I felt about half the time... like I had scratched my skin and touched an alcohol swab.  Or like a moderate sunburn.  The pain would range from non-existent about a 3 out of 10.  It never itched.  Skin never flaked or anything.\n\nThe diagnoisis came back as Lichens Sclerosus.  I really don't think it is, though.  For several reasons:  a) I was circumcised as a baby and have heard LS in this situation is extremely rare, b) never had any scaling or itching or weird skin anywhere on penis, c) the biopsy was 23 days ago and just won't heal.  It looks like a hole in my penis with scar tissue all around it.  It stings again like it did before.  d) the photos I've seen online of LS in males is nothing even remotely like what I am dealing with.  \n\nSo I guess I am wondering if anyone else with LS has symptoms like mine.  Pain for about 75% of the day (gets worse as the day continues) and sores that won't heal.  Anyone had a biopsy to confirm? Did the biopsy heal in a reasonable time (3 weeks or less)?  \n\nAny men with LS that were circumcised as a baby?  What was your experience?\n\nI am seeing my dermatologist again tomorrow, and would love some feedback before I push back.

30, I think, without me knowing what it was. It was slow progressing but sped up as got older. I got regular slight bleedings of the glans of the penis and a lot of skin loss / skin shedding. My foreskin started to constrict, which was never an issue before.\nI want to add here, that my urethral problems were very slight, not much pain there, but even in the urethra it started to get worse.\n\nSo with the symptoms described above, it definitely got worse and that was around when I turned 36(or 37). I went to a doctor and got the LS diagnosis. The doctor even said, that maybe we will have to do the circumcision if it does not get better.\n\nWhat I understood from the doctor was, that there is no good treatment for this.\n\nSo I researched online, and after weeks I found a good hint in a german online forum (devoted to this topic), sadly I can no longer find the original posting.\n\nSo what helped me a lot was to separate the foreskin from the glans of the penis. Basically to pull the foreskin back, wrap a thin, stable, hygenic tissue around the glans of the penis, and the fold the foreskin back over the glans. So that the tissue paper gets stuck between glans and foreskin.\n\nTo be honest, I just use the tisue paper that is sold to sneeze in (paper handkerchief), because it is easily available and stable enough. Normal toilet paper disintegrates to easily. But it works nonetheless, and sometimes I use it, if I have nothing else on hand.\n\nIn my case, I have no more skin shedding, no more bleeding and the foreskin stopped shrinking. Using the procedure for 4-5 years now.\n\nHope this helps someone.\n\nMaybe this does not work in more severe cases, I don't know.\n\nOther stuff that I do:\nwash the glans with a mild cleaning solution at least every second day and apply some coconut oil, which is specifically sold for the genital area.\n\nIt wouldn't hurt to get vitamin D levels checked, since it is related to autoimmune diseases (like LS is), I personally take a supplement from time to time.\n\nFinally the Disclaimer: I am not a medical professional, this is not medical advice. Just my personal experience.\n\nBest wishes to you all.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1326, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My procedure to keep LS in check for several years now", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/nk6tb2/my_procedure_to_keep_ls_in_check_for_several/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "WhiteNoise86", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2dy5tr3a", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1621885531, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/nk6hzs/my_lichen_as_a_male/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nk6hzs", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/nk6hzs/my_lichen_as_a_male/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1621885543, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi all, I am 35, male.

No matter how innocent a search I conduct on Google, LS always shows up. I have no other symptoms except clitoral itching. Vulva appears normal, no abnormal discharge, no smell, no pain with PIV sex or sexual stimulation of any kind. Even the itch isn't that bad, just continues to resurface randomly. I've considered a yeast infection that's just on the outside, and I've considered smegma buildup causing irritation/itching, since I have noticed the little smegma \"pearls\" since itching. But the truth is I just don't know.\n\nMy question is are there any ways for me to rule out potential causes on my own? For example, should I buy the typical yeast infection medication at my local pharmacy? Or could I put hydrocortisone cream around my clitoris? If either of those solved the itch, could I theoretically rule out LS? I'd never heard of an external yeast infection but apparently they can be a thing.\n\nI *am* able to see a doctor eventually (though I'm still mortified at the potential cost $$ because I don't have traditional insurance, only healthcare sharing which means I will be reimbursed *after* paying for all my medical expenses), but I'm in the middle of a huge transitional period. My husband and I are moving across the country (US) next week and taking a month long fun trip to do it, so it's just a bad time to try to get in to see a doctor. Even then, I've no clue what kind of doctor to start with. If there was a way to temporarily treat the itch, and/or potentially rule out LS with a simple OTC treatment, that's going to be my only option until July.\n\nThanks!

My GP, however,  thinks it makes perfect sense, so she called in a Rx. \n\nI've seen posts where some of you said the clob wasn't working but a less potent steroid did. My question to you fine people is, how did you come to the conclusion that clob was too strong and what was your experience with the less potent steroid? \n\nSorry this is so long!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1316, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Steroid downgrade experience?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/nhbn1a/steroid_downgrade_experience/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "wildermind582", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bnti7v8z", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1621499910, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ngusrf/confused/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ngusrf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ngusrf/confused/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1621499921, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI\u2019m a 25yo female and have been struggling with symptoms similar to LS for a few months.

If so how is it and has it made anything better/worse for you?\n\nEvery day I\u2019m very anxious, can cry over nothing sometimes, overthink etc. My periods have also become very painful and before I started taking birth control/not until recently things mentally on my period were okay but now i feel awful, I change and can\u2019t see anything positively, cry a lot, can\u2019t get out of bed and don\u2019t have the motivation to eat/do things to keep me alive etc. It\u2019s seemed to have gotten worse over the last few months as this month it was the most painful one of my life and the worst my mental health has been for ages. I really didn\u2019t want to live with how I felt (didn\u2019t have suicidal thoughts or anything but more that feeling of just not wanting to exist yk?)\n\nHowever, I have no problems physically other than my period really, no sexual problems caused by it etc. I don\u2019t want to lose that because my struggle with LS the past year has done that for me, I\u2019ve finally got it under control so I know if sex became painful again I\u2019d lose it.\n\nI did also wonder if stopping the combined pill could make my LS improve but when I spoke with my doctor she said it doesn\u2019t make a difference, what have you guys heard or experienced about that? \n\nSo a few questions for you guys:\n\n1) did you need to make any special arrangements for IUD insertion? (eg smaller speculum, extra lube etc)\n\n2) how has the IUD affected your LS?\n\n3) does the IUD cause painful sex eg if your cervix is hit is it extra painful etc?\n\n4) would you recommend the pill or a copper iud more?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1313, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Getting an IUD?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/neb9xy/getting_an_iud/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Resident-Feed5006", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_brly25pp", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1621226389, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ne6unf/ls_diagnosis_had_it_for_years_most_likely/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ne6unf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ne6unf/ls_diagnosis_had_it_for_years_most_likely/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1621226400, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi, \n\nI'm 24 and I have LS.

I'm having a follow up soon to discuss this more but there doesn't really seem to be much of an LP community so here I am. \n\nI've read a lot of posts on here but I have a few things that I haven't got a clear answer on sorry this is long but I'm young and worried! I will be going over these things with my doctor next appointment anyways but it's a few weeks away. \n\nCan you go swimming? I'm thinking of joining a gym that has a salt water pool but im not sure if swimming is irritating or bad for the steroid creams? I'm only using hydrocortisone 2.5 right now because clobetasol was irritating and so was Halbatosol. \n\nDoes exercise or weight loss make your symtoms better or worse? I've lost 60 pounds right before being diagnosed and I want to lose another ~ 30ish but I'm scared that will make me have a bad flare. \n\nSex, I'm a virgin so I don't know if it will be painful for me or not but exams are very painful for me. My doctor said I would be able to have sex because I haven't fused over and that my length and width are normal but she didn't mention anything about pain. Do you use dialators? Where did you get them, how long have you used them and when did you see improvement? What lube and condoms do you use and does the steroid affect your partner? \n\nFor those of you who have lost your labia minora, do partners care? I still have some of mine left but they're discolored and small. I basically have nothing near my vaginal opening only around my clit area. \n\nPubic hair. Do you find that having hair irritates the skin? I've always been a bush woman and have never shaved but recently I've been trimming pretty short and I think there's been less irritation. I'm thinking of getting an electric razor but not sure if that would be good for LS skin. \n\nToilet paper and underwear, best brands? Right now I'm using MD and Jockey but curious about what other people use. \n\n Does anyone here smoke weed? Does it help your symtoms at all? I am curious if anyone sees improvement with thc or cbd. And from what I've heard alcohol is bad? \n\nThanks!

Obviously I don\u2019t have the scientific knowledge to back any of that up and it probably sounds really silly so please ignore that idea as it\u2019s quite profound but I do also wonder about it with the lack of info we have on covid and it\u2019s after effects.\n\nAnyway, with how badly I reacted to covid I\u2019m seriously considering getting vaccinated however I\u2019m also scared of it making my LS worse.

I'm thinking of joining a gym that has a salt water pool but im not sure if swimming is irritating or bad for the steroid creams? I'm only using hydrocortisone 2.5 right now because clobetasol was irritating and so was Halbatosol. \n\n\n2. Does exercise or weight loss make your symtoms better or worse? I've lost 60 pounds right before being diagnosed and I want to lose another ~ 30ish but I'm scared that will make me have a bad flare. \n\n\n3. Sex, I'm a virgin so I don't know if it will be painful for me or not but exams are very painful for me. My doctor said I would be able to have sex because I haven't fused over and that my length and width are normal but she didn't mention anything about pain. Do you use dialators? Where did you get them, how long have you used them and when did you see improvement? What lube and condoms do you use and does the steroid affect your partner? \n\n\n4. For those of you who have lost your labia minora, do partners care? I still have some of mine left but they're discolored and small. I basically have nothing near my vaginal opening only around my clit area. \n\n\n\n5. Pubic hair. Do you find that having hair irritates the skin? I've always been a bush woman and have never shaved but recently I've been trimming pretty short and I think there's been less irritation.

I just got my first dose of Moderna yesterday and I'm not having any symtoms but I'm worried that the 2nd shot will cause a flare. Has anyone had a flare after the second shot? \n\n\n8.

I have had blood work, swabs, biopsies. I have been tested for ALL STDS/STI'S all NEG. I have seen 3 GYN's, 2 Derms and 2 Primary Care as well as an Allergist. There's a lot to my story as this has now been going on a year. \n\nI was treated for yeast(Aug), lactobacillus overgrowth (sept) and staph (oct) since then other than redness/inflammation they don't \"see\" anything that's abnormal. I got a skin biopsy and the results came back Lichen Simplex Chronicus or possible early LS. Hydrocortisone helps my symptoms but they come back, Clobetasol burned when I used it. I don't have white patches or any architecture changes right now. I was given a 3 week course of oral prednisone which helped ALOT. Unfortunately, my symptoms are slowing returning now that I am off. Oddly I get a break during my cycle and for a few days after my cycle. Once the discharge/ovulation kicks in its over. Sometimes it seems like my skin HATES my secretion's and sweat. When I work out I pay for it. I have been tested for yeast/trich/bv when this happens and its always negative, I have also taken diflucan and extended courses of diflucan during this time, nothing helps. I have been waiting since Feb for skin patch testing and still waiting. Due to covid they are out of the kit I need. \n\nA couple things to add: I use only water to clean the area and vanicream for body wash. All free and clear detergent, no dryer sheets, 100% cotton underwear or no underwear. I work from home so loose sweatpants always. GYN told me to stop tampons so now 100% cotton pads, no sex AT ALL. I drink tons of water and eat ok not terrible but I'm not a health nut either. No alcohol, smoking, or meds.

Here are my product/lifestyle suggestions that help me:\n\nSupplements:\n- Daily multivitamin (I take Alive Men\u2019s Energy- I\u2019m female but the iron in women\u2019s supplements gives me a bellyache)\n- Vitamin E (be careful with this especially if combining a multivitamin with an additional vitamin e supplement, do not take more than 1,000mg or 1,500 IU per day of vitamin E)\n- Probiotic (helps with regulating vaginal flora; all our ointments can throw us off, causing yeast infections etc. which worsen LS symptoms)\n- Turmeric (anti inflammatory)\n- Apple cider vinegar (ingested orally!!- don\u2019t put it on your genitals pls!)- (helps alkalinize the body which can help regulate vaginal pH..and no, you don\u2019t need to drink alkaline water)\n\nProducts:\n- For soaps I like cetaphil, dove sensitive skin, Tom\u2019s of Maine sensitive, or vanicream. Don\u2019t use anything with fragrance. I use these on my whole body as soap inevitably drips down there in the shower and can burn if it\u2019s not the right kind. I use these for shaving too. No shaving creams!\n- I use vitamin e oil on my vulva for moisture and soothing any minor irritation/tears in between \u201cflare ups.\u201d Also helps with scarring!\n- I take baths with fragrance free epsom salt. Best to avoid Epsom salts with essential oils like ones targeted toward \u201cstress relief\u201d and stuff like that. I know a lot of stuff online will tell you how great essential oils are for LS but mostly they are irritating. Nothing with fragrance (essential oils included) should go down there. \n- If you are able to have sex, ALWAYS lube it up.\n- Always always always 100% cotton underwear\n- No underwear in bed/to sleep.

It will be long so prepare yourself. \n\nI was recently diagnosed with LS. About six months ago this all started. I am 31 yo cis female. I also have very sensitive, allergy prone skin and generalized anxiety disorder (not medicated). This all started with itching and I assumed it was a yeast infection and treated it as that for months. I went to multiple doctors who tested me for everything under the sun and it was all negative. I even had some skin tags surgically removed because one of my doctors thought I had HPV genital warts but they came back as skin tags. I've been on every single OTC and Rx cream you can imagine including clob which did not work for me. Finally, I got better insurance and I went to my original OBGYN.\n\nHe immediately said I do not have HPV and did a biopsy for LS. The biopsy was awful. He did not use stitches and I thought I was infected but I was not, my skin was SO inflamed and red. The biopsy is finally starting to get better (almost two weeks ago) but I developed a red rash around the biopsy sight that is intensely painful, with burning and itch. I cannot even sit without a donut pillow. Previously I had intense itching and burning on the sides, like where underwear would sit, and on the top of the pubis mound. I never had redness before but I did lose pigmentation in my perineum but no where else. It seems like the itching changes daily. But now it's centered around the red rash basically around the anal ring. \n\nSO my gyno prescribed me Nystatin/Triamcinolone cream to apply twice daily. It worked at first but now I need to apply it three times a day. The clob didn't really help me, I think it was too strong after reading all these posts. I think the Triamcinolone cream is good but maybe this one I have is not strong enough and also mixed with an anti fungal which I think might be irritating my skin.\n\nMy questions are: \n\n1. What type and strength of Triamcinolone cream/ointment is usually prescribed? \n2. I struggle with hemorrhoids that are not going away, even after months on all different types of steroid creams and  phenylephrine suppositories. Is the LS making the hemorrhoids worse? I have an appt with a vein specialist.      \n3. Should I make an appointment with a Derm? I see some people on here have better results with a Derm vs. an OBGYN.\n4. I take Zyrtec 10mg at night for the itching and I think it helps, has anyone had any good results with taking allergy meds like this for LS? Or even an Rx allergy med like Vistaril? \n5. I have an upcoming appt with my PCP to get on anxiety meds, I am thinking Buspar. Does anxiety and stress really make LS worse? I've been struggling with anxiety for years and I think it's finally time to get medicated. I cannot take SSRIs due to another medical issue. \n6. I am reading about different diets that help LS, does this actually work? I eat pretty healthy to begin with. How do you go about this diet method? \n\nThanks all, this is long and I have been thinking about all this for weeks. When I was first diagnosed I was mortified and had a panic attack for two days straight.  Reading about LS online is NOT good. I am in a relationship and I was imaging the worst scenarios. Our sex life is in the toilet because of this. He is super supportive but I feel like I am damaged goods now and he will leave me. I know it's crazy but this is my fear. I really hope this gets better.  \n\nThanks again.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1271, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I have a lot of questions", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/mxlpxe/i_have_a_lot_of_questions/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "skynicks", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4krz3uhd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1619250374, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/mxf88a/lube_recommendations/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mxf88a", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 19, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/mxf88a/lube_recommendations/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1619250384, "score": 1, "selftext": "Sorry for getting pretty personal here, but I mean, this is a very intimate disease.\nSo, I was diagnosed with lichen sclerosus at 5 years old (I know, crazy and very rare, but yeah, I was 5,) and I\u2019m now 21.

The upper part of my glans has thinner whitened skin with brown spots and some red discoloration around the hole. There is a white ring around the lower part of my foreskin with brown spots and a lot of red and dry skin around my frenulum. The white skin on my glans and around my foreskin seems to be thinner and also has a slightly different texture which becomes very noticeable after an erection because it is more wrinkled. The condition doesn't cause much discomfort, and it is a mainly cosmetic issue right now. The redness around the frenulum bothers me a lot though, because of the way it looks and the fact that it gets even worse every time I masturbate.\n\nI have now seen another dermatologist a month ago, and she told me that she doesn't think it is lichen sclerosus because people who have it usually experience more discomfort. She speculated about some other conditions of which I don't remember the names (something with hyperpigmentation) and prescribed me protopic 0.1% (to use once a day) and gave me a soap. After two weeks of using the cream I haven't seen much of a difference. I then decided to additionally use a moisturizer and the texture of the skin improved. Also made the redness look a little lighter. Now I have been using protopic for almost a month and the moisturizer for about a week and the skin doesn't seem to further improve. Even after using the cream and moisturizing every day the shape of the redness seems to stay exactly the same. (It became a little lighter but won't change its shape at all).\n\nMy dermatologist told me to come back after three months to check the white and brown spots, but I have read on the Internet that you should consult your dermatologist in case protopic doesn't make visible results after the first two weeks of use.\n\nEven though my dermatologist doesn't think it is LS I still suspect it might be because it looks very similar to some images of LS I saw on the internet and because none of the creams previous dermatologists and urologists prescribed solved the issue. \n\nCould the fact that I masturbate frequently be the reason I don't see much improvement? Should I make a new appointment and tell that the cream didn't work or should I continue using it? If protopic doesn't work is there a good chance a cortisone cream might do the job?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id":

"selftext": "*TLDR at the bottom*\n\nHi you kind people in the LS forum, I\u2019m back with an update about my child and like the last time, I apologize for any grammar since English is my second language. \n\nAbout a month ago I wrote a post in here about my 9 year old daughter who I suspected had LS even though our family doctors had repeatedly diagnosed it as nothing but yeast (ofc). \n\nAfter having pushed several times because I was not accepting the yeast- answer, one of our family doctors referred my daughter to the pediatric department of surgery at the biggest hospital in our country (we live in Scandinavia).\n\nAt the pediatric department of surgery my daughter wasn\u2019t examined properly, so instead I wanted a LS specialist to take a look.\n\nThe plan for my daughter was then to get referred to a vulvar clinic where she was supposed to be examined by a gyno specializing in LS, but I ended up accepting the doctor\u2019s recommendations for the dermatology department at another hospital and today was the day of my daughter\u2019s appointment and we finally got an answer. \n\nThe dermatologist examined my daughter and almost instantly diagnosed her with lichen sclerosus, there was no doubt she said. \n\nShe then said that she would always recommend a biopsy for the the child\u2019s journal since \u201cno one would believe my daughter in 20 years when she says that she had LS as a child\u201d (I don\u2019t know what she meant by that?), but said it wasn\u2019t necessary since she could diagnose her on sight.\n\nIn contrary to the other doctor who just wanted to do a biopsy without giving her a proper examination first, I could tell that the dermatologist knew exactly what she was looking at. \n\nI must admit though that as soon as I heard the diagnosis I felt like I was going to faint, even though I had done all the research and pushed for my daughter to get a diagnosis (especially after having read all of your stories of getting misdiagnosed, delayed diagnosis etc\ud83d\udc94\u2764\ufe0f), because in an instant my daughter went from being a little girl to suddenly being a little girl with an autoimmune disease. \n\nThe dermatologist on the other hand told me to take it easy and said that they have great results when treating children for LS and yes it can be a lifelong condition but it\u2019s very manageable she said, we just need to start the treatment. \n\nI\u2019ve cried a lot today but now I\u2019m determined to push through because my baby needs normalcy now that we finally have a diagnosis. \n\nShe\u2019s the most amazing little sensitive smart girl and she\u2019s a trooper (bought her a huge LEGO set and she\u2019s already playing with it and telling jokes as if nothing had happened\u2764\ufe0f), and we will learn new ways and go through the flare ups together. \n\nTLDR: My 9 year old daughter was diagnosed with LS today. \n\nNow for the treatment: \nThe dermatologist wrote this plan for her and I\u2019m going to the pharmacy tomorrow to get the medication. \n\nI asked the doctor about clob (dermovat in Europe) but the doctor said that she would never give a grade 4 steroid cream to a child, so she prescribed Synalar (fluocinolone acetonide) cream which is a grade 3 and with this regimen: \n_________________________________________\n\nWeek 1 + 2: once a day \nWeek 3 + 4: three times a week (MWF)\nWeek 5 + 6: twice a week \nWeek 7 and for maintenance onwards: once a week\n_________________________________________\n\n*I completely trust the doctor but since you all amazing people live with LS, does this regimen look okay?*\n\nBecause when I google Synalar for Lichen Sclerosus nothing shows up except it being used for oral Lichen Planus, so does anyone have any experience with this steroid for LS? \n\nI know adults are given a grade 4 but just wanted to ask, maybe some of you use this for maintenance? I hope it\u2019s strong enough to heal my baby!\n\nThank you so much in advance and thank you again for the amazing people who answered me on my last post, you truly helped me with my anxiety\u2764\ufe0f\n\nAnxious mama", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1256, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My 9 year old daughter was diagnosed today + question at the end", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/msbvb0/my_9_year_old_daughter_was_diagnosed_today/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "princesseash", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5y38o4l2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1618594757, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ms8c9e/update_it_was_both_ls_and_hpv_tips/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ms8c9e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ms8c9e/update_it_was_both_ls_and_hpv_tips/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1618594769, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello, I posted a few weeks ago concerned if I had been misdiagnosed with LS because I had all these white bumps showing up at the entrance of my vagina.

But my foreskin remained tighter.\n\nYesterday in the shower I felt a sharp pain around my frenulum when pulling back the foreskin to clean. Today in the shower, my foreskin is so tight that I can no longer get it over the head of my penis to clean! I'm quite concerned.\n\nThe area around my frenulum is a little whiter than usual, as is the now tight phimotic band. Since today, it also hurts a little when I pee. No blood.\n\nAt first I was afraid my hypospadic urethral opening is tearing into my frenulum. But then I read about LS. Could it be that?

I have some superficial clitoral pain and just recently the skin sort of under/of my clitoral hood seemed to tear. Could that be from the topical steroids? Or is delicate vulvar skin a symptom of LS?

I\u2019ve had issues with tearing after sex, wiping after pee, but no real white scarring or loss of anatomy. I think it\u2019s a low estrogen issue, but I digress. So I started clob ointment 2.5 weeks ago and have started tapering down.\n\nAlmost immediately I started experiencing tightness in my chest a few days after starting ointment. I thought I went to hard on my workouts and eased into yoga instead. 9 days in, it became painful to breathe like my airways were swollen. \n\nWent to urgent care. EKG, chest x-ray, lymph nodes were not swollen, and d dimer blood results came back normal. I was advised to take it easy and not to workout over the next week or so.\n\nFast forward to 2 weeks after starting clob. I didn\u2019t put my ointment on Sunday night this week, and Monday I felt like 60% back to my old self again. Used the ointment Monday night, and within 30 minutes of using it.. my chest tightness came back fill force and I thought I needed to go to the ER. I dealt with it, and was happy I woke up Tuesday.\n\nDidn\u2019t use ointment Tuesday, and today I feel like 80% my old self. \n\nThere\u2019s got to be a connection, right?\nCalled and spoke with my doctor office\u2019s triage nurse.

Albeit, it's better than it was over the last few months that we tried to have sex (over a year ago)... but tolerating pain isn't really what I want out of my life.\n\nI guess I'm going to try topical estrogen, but I'm just not feeling positive. I'm supposed to start tapering the steroid in a week and I certainly don't want to apply it everyday because of the risk of getting too much systemic absorption... but this is the second prescription topical I've tried and there just isn't much proof that topical hormones are effective. I'm pretty concerned that through the taper it'll rebound and go back to ulcerating.\n\nThe area around my anus is still just as bad as when I started steroids and it's still bleeding and fissuring!

I'm down to twice-weekly application and I find that this fragile feeling is worst immediately after I do the steroids and then feels gradually better as time passes, until the next application when it starts again. I apply thinly already, so it isn't too much steroid.

I have an open (stuck) Eustachian tube (ear) and went to an ENT to see if it could get corrected. After trying many different nasal drops I was given estrogen nose drops.  I was told this would not be systemic but  after one month my clitoris became very itchy.  Later my nipples became sore and I developed a burning sensation in my vulvar region.   I stopped using the estrogen, (it was actually working for my ear) then got a period and a UTI!  (this caused my GYN to order a uterine ultrasound and a biopsy - all good).  After the UTI cleared up the burning did not.  My inner labia was red and inflamed and burning horribly.  I talked to my GP who over the phone prescribed Nystatin for yeast.  When it didn't help he told me to see a GYN or go to Urgent care.  My UroGYN said he didn't see anything wrong, gave me  Fluconazole and said it was probably from cycling.  I am an avid cyclists.  I love it and I ride my bike with my friends about 100-200 miles a week.  I stopped riding for 2 weeks with no improvement.   After sitting for an hour on a small seat at a wedding in the woods I felt like I had a ragging UTI.  All I wanted to do was get home and get an antibiotic.  40 minutes in the car and it vanished.  What is this?   Saw GYN multiple times and now and he is testing me for herpes, will do a bladder scope and he put me on Clobetasol for possible LS because it is white around my vaginal and ureteral openings.   It burns all the time.  I really don't have any itching just constant burning.  I started using Vaseline which seemed to sooth the area a bit.   \nAfter the UTI the burning was at a level of 9-10.  I was miserable for 2.5 months and no one seemed to listen or take me seriously.  Since then (3 months now) it has settled down to a level of 1-2 thank goodness but it still really bothers me.  I have no idea what this is and I am scared.  I am only using the Clobetasol once every other day (started a week ago) because I am afraid it will do something worse like the estrogen did.  I have read LS can possibly be caused by trauma/friction down there, hormonal changes and there is a possible connection with other skin issues like eczema.  Both my daughter and grandson have eczema and I have some flaky skin issue on my forehead, so I figure I have a lot of risk factors.  I am afraid I might have caused this myself with all the bicycle riding.  I am scared and miserable.

My gyno stated she found a small white patch on my labia (in the clitoral area) and said it could be possible LS, or something that could resolve on its own. She gave me clobetasol, which has not been working. When I went back in, her PA examined me this time. She said that it does not appear to be LS, and mentioned something about \"pudendal nerve entrapment\" and wants me to go on a gabapentin compound ointment. This sounds like a super expensive treatment and I'm not sure where she came to this conclusion from. \n\nShe stated because all of the tests they ran came back negative (BV, yeast, STDs, etc), then at this point she wants to treat it as neuropathic pain. I told her that I don't really have the \"pins and needles\" or numbness, so much as a raw \"rug burn\" like feeling, dull to sharp pain, itchiness, and sensitivity to touch. She thinks that could all be a part of those symptoms. When I went on this sub, I was recommended alternatives to clob ointment, but the PA stated once again that she does not think it is LS. The gyno has been too busy to examine me, and I have my annual in December. \n\nThey want me to try the gabapentin ointment and follow up in December to see if it is working, as she said it takes a few weeks to start working. At this point I am so tired of almost daily pain/irritation that I don't want to wait until then. Because I purchase my own insurance (I do contract work), I'm not even sure if I can easily get a second opinion without it being a huge ordeal. But I'm wondering, have any of y'all been misdiagnosed and written off before getting an LS diagnosis? Because I don't have obvious visible signs of it, I am worried they are missing the mark.

I came back with a very high ph and no lactobacilli.

So she gave me an estrogen cream prescription and said it should resolve in 6-8 weeks and that steroid cream lowers the estrogen in that area which causes fusing. She said she sees it in breastfeeding women and peri/menopausal women. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone has ever dealt with adhesions before and if the estrogen cream really did help.

So here's my (28 F) backgound. Feel free to skip it to the questions part. I always thought my vulva was normal. Sure, I'd seen porn, and pictures, and yes the inner labia  always looked a bit \"fuller\" than mine but I've always been told that \"every vulva's different and beautiful\" so I didn't really think much of it. I'd never been to the gynaecologist.\n\nUntil I decided to get an IUD. So, I went in, ready to do some yoga breathing, cramp a bit, and go on my merry way.\n\nHe took one look at my vagina and went \"hum, your labia minora is fused to your labia majora.\" \n\nAnd I was just *shocked* He showed me where they are fused, but I just can't fathom how it'd look. It's just *skin*.\n\nThen he showed me a (minor) tear in my perineum and, yeah I knew about that, but in terms of symptoms, I'd sometimes get a little itchy and I get tears easily, but I just assumed wasn't lubricated enough, or that it was the condom's fault, etc.\n\nHe also showed me spots that are \"not normal skin\". But now I look in the mirror and just can't see what spots he was referring to... it just looks all \"normal\" to me lol. Maybe it's a little whitish?\n\nAnd that's my problem: he prescribed the taro-clobetasol 0.05% to put on twice daily for 2 weeks and twice weekly for 3 months after that and to come back in 4 months (and glaxal base cream to put everyday). But... \n\nAnd here's the question part:\n\nWhere does it go? Everywhere? On the \"spots\"? I put it everywhere on my vulva yesterday and this morning, and he said it's sting but it doesn't. Am I lucky or is it just not working?\n\nHe said it could go back to normal. How likely is that? I'm 28 and I don't remember my vagina ever looking different.

little over a week ago when I was Dx'd with LS (I'd been using clob-cream as needed for a couple of years, but this was my first official diagnosis).\n\nWell, I was referred to GYN by my GP for a dark brown irregular lesion on my minor labia just outside my vaginal opening. I saw Gynecology last Monday (7/20) and was diagnosed with lichen sclerosus, which had already caused significant deconstruction to my labia minor. The Gynecologist had her intern and team with her and explained that while almost everything they saw was consistent with LS, the dark brown (black in some places) plaque was not typical for LS and she wanted to biopsy that to rule out melanoma. The plaque measured a little over 11mm from top to bottom and probably 6mm at the largest width. They did a 5mm biopsy on the edge of the plaque (lesion? spot?) and sent with the following: \"Concern for lichen sclerosus, [r/o](https://www.reddit.com/r/o/) malignancy\". They told me last Monday that results typically take a week, but sometimes lately have been taking longer. They said they would call either way. I got my written results today, but still haven't received a phone call. When I got my written results, I tried calling, but they were closed. Tomorrow (being Friday) has strange hours and plans/meetings/whatever for them, so it looks like I won't be able to get in touch with them until Monday and I'd really like some help understanding this. Here's what it says, verbatim.\n\n\\- Consistent with lichen sclerosus.\n\n\\- See comment.\n\nComments\n\nSections demonstrate tangientially sectioned skin and evaluation is limited by suboptimal orientation. There is sparse lichenoid inflammation with mild dermal sclerosis and pigment incontinence. No epidermal atypia or koilocytic changes is identified. Immunohistochemical stains for p16 are performed and demonstrate no strong, block positive staining. The findings are suggestive of lichen sclerosus, however correlation with clinical findings is required.

I didn\u2019t think much about it. Fast forward to the first week of March and the mild itch turned into an intense itch that was localized to the upper area of the labia majora around the area where the clit is but on the part of the skin where the hair grows. It was sooo itchy that sometimes it would wake me up at night. That lasted for a few weeks. During that time I tried applying some hydrocortisone and it didn\u2019t really do much. In April I bought some jock anti fungal itch cream and within 5 days it reduced the itching by about 70%. The upper part of my labia was still itching so I went to the doctors. She looked at my skin. Didn\u2019t notice anything abnormal and prescribed me Fluconazole suspecting it was a yeast infection. I took 3 pills and after I was done with treatment I still had itching. Up until then the itching was just on the skin of the labia majora but around this time I developed a random itch that felt like it was on the mucosal part of the labia minora. It is not constant but it seems to flare up more some days and it feels like I have needles stabbing the labia minora and I have to move around to \u201cscratch\u201d it for it to go away. \n\nAnyway, after I was done with the Fluconazole I did a 7 day treatment of monistat. No relief. Called up my doctor and she then gave me Clotrimazole and betamethasone cream. Used it for about 5 days and didn\u2019t feel any difference so I stopped using it and finally was able to see a gynecologist on May 29. He looked at me said my vulva looked irritated and suspects I have PCOS and that my testosterone levels is probably causing irritation and that when I lose weight my symptoms will go away. He ordered some bloodwork and took a culture swab and put me on Metformin. I have been waiting almost 2 months for my follow up appointment however I already looked at my results online. All my hormone levels were normal and swab came back normal. The only abnormal test was my insulin resistance which I am not worried about because I am already on Metformin and losing weight. \n\nI don\u2019t believe PCOS is causing this chronic itching. My symptoms are not as bad as they were in the very beginning but they are seriously taking a toll on my mental health because it has been 5 months already and I still have no definite answer. I thought that maybe I was having an allergic reacting to something even though I had not changed anything in my routine. I changed soaps including body wash for sensitive skin, stopped using panty liners, switched pad brands, switched toilet paper, even stopped washing with soap and only rinsed with water and still no relief. I thought maybe the skin was really dry and i started applying coconut oil to the labia and didn\u2019t really do anything. Sometimes when I use a cream moisturizer it feels a little better. But I try to avoid putting anything down there to avoid irritation. \n\nThe best way I would describe my current symptoms is a prickly feeling on my labia majora especially on the upper part of my labia by my mons pubis. It\u2019s like that feeling when you shave your genitals and the hair starts growing back except this happens regardless if the hair is long or short. Sometimes it feels like I have tiny tears or cracks on my skin and it will either itch or sting. Most of the itching is on the left side of my labia majora however the right side will itch sometimes too. A random itch on the left side of my labia minor that feels like I have a needle poking the mucosal skin. I have looked down there with a mirror and the skin on my labia majora looks wrinkled more than I have ever noticed and on some areas it looks like patches of little stretch marks. The weird part is that I only have symptoms when there is friction to that area like when I walk around, move or when my clothes rubs up against the skin. If I\u2019m just sitting down I don\u2019t really feel anything. \n\nI have been reading online about lichen scleorosus and lichen simplex. I heard that lichen simplex can be random and triggered by stress. Around the time that this started I was extremely stressed because I was going through a pregnancy scare. The itchy patches that initially started all this could have been triggered by all that stress? and maybe I damaged my skin by all the intense scratching that it then turned into lichen simplex? I\u2019m inclined to believe that I might have lichen simplex but the labia minora mucosal itching is throwing me off because lichen simplex is usually confined to the labia majora area only. I can\u2019t really say that I notice any white patches like you usually do with lichen sclerosus but I could have a very mild/early case? \n\nAnyone who has lichen sclerosus or lichen simplex have you experienced any of these symptoms? I am sinking into a deep pit of depression stressing over this. I finally have a follow up apt with my gynecologist on July 23 and I am going to ask if he thinks this it what it is and ask for clobetasol. If not a biopsy.

I\u2019m trying to get to the bottom of this. I keep having flares here and there where I\u2019ll go from months of using my clobetasol once or twice a week to everyday for a week or even 3 weeks to get my flare under control. Moisturizing with coconut oil and using dilators helps. I\u2019m considering Mona Lisa touch as well. But to counteract the skin thinning effect of clob (as I feel I probably have over done it by attempting to manage my flares for the past two or so years), I\u2019m looking into vitamin serums or vitamin ointments I could use to help protect my skin where it is now.

No itching or pain but occasional red dots that form on the head and foreskin. I found LS online and thought maybe I had that. Just went into a urogolist and before he looked at it, he asked me about my condoms and potential chemical burns. That all checked out, and he looked at my dick. He said everything looked fine and that it just looks a little dry and to not worry about it. I want to trust him, but I also asked him about LS and he said it's very rare and more common in women. Should I get a second opinion from another urologist or go to a derm? Or should I forget about it and move on with my life? It's not causing any present issues with sex or daily life, but if I do have LS, i want to catch it early to that i may be able to treat and manage it effectively.\n\nTldr; have dry glans and sticky foreskin, urologist said everything looks norm and uniform in color.

I later discovered i had infection that caused my bartholin gland to swell and become painful. I thought it was a bartholin cyst so i treated it like one with home remedies (witch hazel, calamine lotion, tea tree oil mixed put on a gauze pad and placed on the area. called \u201cphoebe\u2019s cure\u201d) and ended up literally burning the skin down there before i went to a doctor who told me the swollen area was just an infection. \n\nThe burned skin peeled off after a few days of using coconut and black castor oil and i noticed the skin down there was looking raw and itched a bit but boiled it down to it literally being new skin. I used the topical antibiotic (Fucidin acidic cream 2%) for longer than prescribed because it felt like the cyst had not disappeared completely (later realized it had and what i was feeling was the scar form the incision the doctor made). The Fucidin cause the areas around my anus the bartholin gland to itch a lot and when i stopped using it, the anal itching stopped so i know the cream caused that. \n\nI also discovered the antibiotics caused me to have another yeast infection which i treated and completed treatment so now i have no itching and no pain at all, but there are white lines that run along the side of my vagina (from the vagina-inner thigh fold) and end at my perineum. It doesn\u2019t itch or hurt but it definitely doesn\u2019t look pleasant &amp; it\u2019s tearing quite a bit.

It was accompanied by the frequent need to urinate but a urologist has since helped clear that portion up. Still left with burning. My first gyno visit told me she saw evidence of lichen sclerosus so wanted me to use a steroid cream and follow up in a couple months.\n\nBeen using it now for over 2 weeks and I can't help but feel it isnt really working. In fact, what used to be only a handful of burning days a month, now I seem to be burning now more than not. It does seem to be in the general area she pointed out (it was hard to pin point where the burning was if it was outside or inside). I don't even know what I'm looking for because I can't really tell if I'm seeing white patches or it's just shiny. It does look like I'm a bit red down there. All she told me was to put it on the hairless part once a day for a month at first.\n\nSo I guess I'm just not really sure if it's supposed to be like this or not? Like does it get worse before it gets better? Should I give it more time? Maybe putting it on agitates it and its in fact working overall if I just be patient? Or maybe the burn I'm feeling is something else and LS is not what is causing it after all... I dont seem to be itching, just burning.\n\nI am using Clobetasol Propionate Ointment.

I\u2019m a 20 year old female, and I got diagnosed last week with LS.  I joined some Facebook support groups, but they\u2019re generally all post-menopausal women, and they don\u2019t really talk about what I want to know about.  My mother suggested here because it\u2019s more young-people-oriented.\nFirst off, a little bit about my situation.  When I was diagnosed, it was at a specialty vulvar clinic, the best place in the state to go.  I had been having double yeast/BV infections for over a year, getting tested, taking the Flagyl and Diflucan, never getting relief, going back and doing it all over.  I waited three months for my appointment, and the doctor took one look, and said \u201cYikes!  You poor thing, I know exactly what you have.\u201d  She gave me a list of instructions to follow down to the letter, and honestly it has ruined my confidence and self-image.  \nMy boyfriend broke up with me in January because when we started dating, we were constantly having sex, and it was amazing, but then one day it felt like he was literally ripping me open, and since then I haven\u2019t had successful penetrative intercourse.  He couldn\u2019t wait for me to get better, I guess.  Now I\u2019m ready to start dating again, but the rules I have to follow are crushing my hope that anyone will see me as a partner.  I have narcolepsy as well, so I have a lot of baggage.  On top of that, I can only wear white, 100% cotton underwear, can only use All Free &amp; Clear detergent, and I can\u2019t use the same machine as someone who uses any other detergent.  I can only use Dove Sensitive skin soap, and anyone who wants to be with me has to use it, too.  If that wasn\u2019t enough to kill my sexuality, my labia minora are completely gone, and my clitoris is about 80% sealed over by fusing and scar tissue.  I\u2019m terrified of dating.  I don\u2019t think anyone will ever find me sexy in my white cotton underwear, and it kills the mood to make a date shower before they get with me.  The \u201cyikes\u201d from my doctor was the worst, because what if my partner says that?!?!  I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever have pain-free sex, or even have the opportunity to have sex at all.  I\u2019m just, so broken down by this.  It feels like a death sentence, considering the hookup culture of people my age.

It's not in the figure 8 shape and it's not around the anus-only on the right side of my vulva. It's not bumpy or dry or anything else, either-it's just lighter. It's not itchy, I don't experience tearing. I cant really speak on the pain during sex part, but lubrication seems fine and no problems inserting tampons. \n\nI developed the spot around 2-3 years ago. I went to a gyno to get it checked out and they said it was nothing to worry about, and something about puberty. No mention of lichen sclerosis. I do remember reading that this disease often disappears once prepubescent girls hit puberty, but I would think I'm past that point, no?\n\nEverytime I try to look into it on the internet it suggest lichen sclerosis, so I dont know what else it could possibly be. From what I've seen, no one else has this except for those with lichen sclerosis.\n\nI'm just wondering, is this how it started for those of you with a current diagnosis? Or were symptoms kind of always present? Does this sound like lichen sclerosis? I know only a doctor can give me a diagnosis, but that's not an option for me at the moment, so I thought I could try asking here. \n\nThank you so much, I've done some research on this and my heart goes out to those of you who experience symptoms.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 688, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Skin spotting but no symptoms?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/godn5v/skin_spotting_but_no_symptoms/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sleepy-sensei", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_141z8f", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1589799875, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/glzez7/new_diagnosis/", "gildings": {}, "id": "glzez7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/glzez7/new_diagnosis/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1589799875, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nI was just given a diagnosis of early lichen sclerosus based on a tissue biopsy of a tiny white bump.

I\u2019ve had type 1 diabetes for going on 9 years now, and I\u2019ve had a multitude of complications with it. \n\nAbout 4 years ago, I started seeing signs of LS. Constant, non-stop DEEP itching, thinning skin, painful sex, and awful vulvar fissures and tearing. Worse than I\u2019ve ever seen on any LS images. And because of the diabetes, they would take forever to heal. I would sit on the toilet and tear. I felt like I was splitting open all the time, forget about sex. My blood sugars were not where they should have been, due to stress, diabulimia, and family issues. Doctors didn\u2019t take me seriously, and because of the diabetes, every swan test showed signs of slight yeast. So they chalked it up to that. Got rid of the yeast. Still had symptoms. Changed doctors. Gave me a steroid cream I can\u2019t remember, that just burned and didn\u2019t do much. Tried another one. Same story. \n\nGave up, and dealt with it. A year later, I finally saw a dermatologist for the first time. She looked at it, prescribed me a VERY expensive cream (even recognized it just helped to soothe, didn\u2019t do much else) and said there was no point in biopsy because it would worsen it by taking skin. \n\nEvery doctor since has blamed my diabetes, no matter how under control it is. The itching has almost gone away completely, but I have to use a wand vibrator at night to make the itch go away so I can sleep. \n\nThe tearing and thinning has gotten so. Much. Worse. I\u2019m scarring now. No labia fusion yet but I\u2019m so worried... I\u2019ve now started seeing the white patches. I\u2019m so sick and tired of this. I\u2019ve tried so many things. I\u2019m so scared it\u2019s going to get blamed on the diabetes again and it\u2019s going to just destroy me. I\u2019m scheduling an appointment tomorrow because I can\u2019t handle this anymore.

I was prescribed with various creams incl. steriod treatment that did nothing to improve things and so had a circumsicion operation at 19.\n\nI'm now 24 and whilst I believe I don't technically have active LS anymore, the glans of my penis are still quite damaged - with discolouration, cracked skin, and a tiny blood mark on the head. The skin in general feels so *dead* and is unpleasant to look at. \n\nThere was no real guidance given to me after my circumsicion operation about what would happen next. I was young at the time and I felt many aspects of the condition and the operation were not properly explained to me.\n\nLast year I arranged an appointment to see a private urologist to see if there was anything that could be done to even slightly improve the condition of the glans. They said there was (they compared the skin of the penis to the skin of the mouth, able to change with the right treatment), and I was prescribed with clobetesol, some different kinds of soap, and epaderm. None of these did anything to fundamentally improve the condition. They also suggested vaseline as an alternative to epaderm, which ironically does a much better job in my opinion of making things look better (at least temporarily). They then suggested a biopsy to try and see if I was having an allergic reaction to something - I didn't arrange a follow-up appointment, they didn't really seem like they had a strong idea what to do.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions what to do in my situation? If there's any specific recommendations for dermatologists / urologists in London, the UK, or even worldwide with video consultation, I would greatly appreciate it if you direct messaged me.\n\nFrom some things I've read it sounds like there's nothing to be done to improve the condition. I partly arranged to see the urologist for them to say this and get closure. However I still have not had a medical professional say this to me, and I feel like I owe it to my future self to explore every avenue :). I also find it hard to believe that someone my age cannot do anything to even slightly improve things - and I am also nervous of it getting worse as I get older. \n\nFundamentally I would really love to be connected with a medical professional who's truly familiar with  my condition, and get advice from people who've been in a similar situation.\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1057, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Advice for glans treatment after lichen sclerosus (UK)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/l78fao/advice_for_glans_treatment_after_lichen_sclerosus/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "vanessav98", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_91o6880j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1611812040, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "edited": 1611812720, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/l6p46b/labia_minora_shrinking/", "gildings": {}, "id": "l6p46b", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/l6p46b/labia_minora_shrinking/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1611812831, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello!

It definitely worked to help heal up cuts I would get from attempting to have intercourse. But even if I was all healed I would try to have sex and I would end up getting cuts/itchy/sore after sex. The inside of my vagina was also affected. I felt like I was swollen on one side about 2 centimeters inside. Even when I would put a finger inside I would get stinging pain. I had this pain for over a year. It was so long that I can't even decipher when it actually started to go away. I think it was caused by me accidentally ripping out a tampon. (I had the tampon in for hours and thought it would be more wet than it was, but I believe this is what caused the ongoing pain).  \n\n\n**So the first thing that helped me** was I stopped taking all of my medications to try to figure out if that was causing the LS. (I am not telling you to do this. This is only what helped me figure out what was causing my dryness. Obviously consult your doctor before you do anything drastic) At the time I was taking birth control, topical steroid cream, allergy medicine (zyrtec), nasacort, and asthma medications (albuterol and fluticasone propionate). To make sure my asthma symptoms wouldn't flare up I started in the spring because I usually only have asthma during winter. I stopped taking everything (not all at the same time but eventually). I slowly started to get more wet down there and even though I go through at least 3 boxes of tissues a week it's all worth it. I noticed the allergy medicine was the culprit the made my hands and feet dry and cracked. The birth control definitely dried out my vagina and I've lost 20 lbs since stopping. With the albuterol I don't notice any side effects. Ive been taking my asthma medicine since it's winter but I recently started taking the fluticasone propionate and I've been dry ever since I started taking it. Breathing is obviously more important though.  \n\n\n**One last thing that everyone could try** is unbleached, chlorine free toilet paper. I personally use the toilet paper for my bum, but I actually dab with towels after I pee. I was having recurrent yeast infections for the past year and figured out that when I got out of the shower I would feel completely fine no itching or burning, but as soon as I would wipe (angel soft/charmin) I would get irritated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1051, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What helped me with LS", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/l6850z/what_helped_me_with_ls/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "megs167", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4jiu5mo7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1611759648, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/l667mc/28f_is_it_best_to_see_a_dermotologist_or_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "l667mc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/l667mc/28f_is_it_best_to_see_a_dermotologist_or_a/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1611759660, "score": 1, "selftext": "28F: Is it best to see a dermotologist or a gynecologist for diagnosis of lichen sclerosis?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1051, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "28F: Is it best to see a dermotologist or a gynecologist for diagnosis of lichen sclerosis?

I\u2019ve seen several people since who\u2019ve said they can\u2019t see any signs of lichen sclerosus and have advised me to dismiss it as a diagnosis. I\u2019m kind of worried though - I feel as though my labia minora are getting smaller, and they feel sort of sticky (I think that\u2019s the best way of describing it). I\u2019m also not sure as to whether they\u2019re fusing to the labia majora, or what this would look like. Currently what I\u2019m noticing is an absence of the smooth redish type skin of the labia majora - it almost feels like the bottom of the labia minora and the labia majora are coming together, making both smaller in the process either side. But I haven\u2019t seen any descriptions like this, and like I said I\u2019ve had the idea that it\u2019s lichen sclerosus dismissed several times (getting referred to a dermatologist in the U.K. - especially when they repeatedly say it\u2019s not LS - is difficult). Is there anything else that could be causing what I feel is this loss? I also have vulval pain and what feels like \u2018buzzing\u2019 or a pins and needles sensation in the area. I\u2019ve put on some weight recently, and have been pretty low/down and I wondered whether this might have anything to do with it. \nTLDR - at my wit\u2019s end, doctors unable to diagnose a problem, feel like I have labial fusion/shrinking but unsure whether my description of it is symptomatic of LS \nThanks for reading this!!

Lidocaine to numb to prevent being tempted during the day.\n\nAlso tried antibiotics for whatever reason.\n\nThe thing is...nothing gives me any relief for even a minute.

It usually went away after the summer months. I moved to SFlorida, and it started up and never stopped. My symptom is when I wipe, or otherwise touch my urethra or the lower part of my vulva, I get intensely itchy. I scratch, it swells, and then it doesn\u2019t bother me for a day or two. This has been going on for a year straight.\n\nI saw my regular GYN in August, who suspected an external/season yeast infection. Treated with twice daily clotrimazole and betamethasone cream and after the treatment I was fine for about two weeks. I live about 4 hours from that GYN and was working on my masters degree, so I hadn\u2019t been able to go back up. \n\nI then brought it up to my dermatologist, who, while not really being able to do anything, wrote me a script for one dose of an antifungal. That didn\u2019t do anything. She told me I will likely need a biopsy or culture.\n\nNow during this time, there has never been any discharge outside of a very watery one when it gets itchy. No white, no burning, no pain with sex. Just looks like my regular vulva. \n\nI scheduled an appt with a local women\u2019s health clinic and saw the ARNP. She said it looked normal, but because I have issues with dermatitis, she thinks it might be lichen sclerosus and told me it was fairly common. She said she wasn\u2019t sure, but she is going to try treating for it anyway and if that doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll do a biopsy. She told me to Google the symptoms and maybe I\u2019d be surprised at how many match up with me and then wrote me a script for clobetasol cream. \n\nWhen I googled the symptoms, I really only have one: pruritus. The cream alleviates the itching, but so did the betamethasone, so I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s just the fact that it\u2019s a steroid? \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m 25 and I\u2019m wondering, has anyone else gone through a similar journey?

I\u2019m only sexual active with one partner (in a wlw relationship) and masturbation:sex is almost always uncomfortable painful and leaves little tears near my clitoris. I\u2019ve been to the gynecologist three times now. My first two visits were awful, i was just told that i had a yeast infection and was giving anti fungal and steroid cream. In those two visits i was only given pabst smears (ik they don\u2019t test for yeast:( )that came back negative, but upon my third visit, the doctor confirmed with me that it\u2019s not a yeast infection and that it\u2019s eczema. \n\nmost things that cause an eczema flare i\u2019ve already been mindful of in terms of hygiene, cotton underwear, moisturizing, sleeping w out underwear etc.\n\n\ni think i might have ls. i have whitish/pale patches/streaks lining my innerlabia. i didn\u2019t bring the discoloration to my gynecologist just because i\u2019ve had a bad experience with my first one, but she made a quick comment saying there\u2019s discoloration. i was unsure if it was because of the redness from irritation or what i think is the white patches. \n\nalso experiencing pressure in my bladder area :/  and the urge to pee, but nothing happens, especially at night. i do drink a lot of water, usually more than 80 ounces but it\u2019s becoming very noticeable and annoying. i\u2019m constantly feeling weird down there so i wonder if it\u2019s more psychological idk:( basically i just feel the need to use the bathroom and try to go multiple times in the night sometimes .

Worst symptoms is skin constantly peeling away (like wet tissue paper) with the slightest touch (not dry). Even sitting down to pee is agony because the skin is splitting and very raw and burning intensely. I've been seeing Drs on and off since August and had steroid ointments with a little improvement. I have been using Diprobase ointment between steroid treatments as it is left alone it immediately gets 10x worse.\n I was supposed to be reffered to a gyno in October but every time I call they say 'we are still seeing patients from last February we have no space'. \nSometimes the pain is so awful I just have to lay in bed and take painkillers - there's no healthy skin left. I have no idea what to do. Apparently you can't use steroid creams for long because it thins the skin.\nWhat treatments are available and or have worked for you? I'm desperate for it to improve, I'm so tired of being in so much pain all the time. Also haven't been able to sleep with my partner for almost a year because it's gotten so bad so it's putting a bit of strain on the relationship at times. \nI'm totally at a loss \ud83d\ude1f",

The dermo prescribed me with a emollient and a steroid cream, after a few weeks of using them everything was in the clear. Since then I have only had to use the cream a few times over the last year. From mid December I found a small dot at the back of my penis, below the head, I didn\u2019t think much of it and just left it.

I had my first episode a few months ago that lasted 2-3 months and eventually went away with steroidal cream use in the last 15 odd days. (Prior to that my gp\u2019s were treating me with various uti medications thinking it was a uti complication). This time it has been already lasted 2 odd months with only intermittent relief. And for the past 10 days, despite me using a cream with higher potency since the last couple of days, it is not going away. Am in constant pain. I don\u2019t know when this becomes ok for you once you start using the cream? How many times a day do you apply it? I also am having a UTI with it. Again. And it is just so debilitating. I can\u2019t stand the constant pain. I can\u2019t sit. I am sorry for venting.

I have never experienced tears until this year. The tears are around the vagina opening. Is this normal? Is it possible that the LS has returned? As I read online it says there is no cure... so in my mind the LS has returned and I need to make an appointment with the doctor who diagnosed me. It is not easy for me to orgasm, no guy has ever been able to.

Nobody seems to have noticed my post about it though. \n\nDid I scare everyone away with the length of my post or what?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1224, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New to reddit and the group here.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ml32fx/new_to_reddit_and_the_group_here/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lmea14", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_labzv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1617660181, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/mkw50a/covid_vaccine/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mkw50a", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/mkw50a/covid_vaccine/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1617660192, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a (thankfully) mild case of BXO (caught it in time and the doctors knew what it was, so was never allowed to get beyond a certain point).\n\nI'm due to get the COVID vaccine this week (Pfizer).

In another study it was found out that many patients who had undergone the urostomy ( a surgical procedure that replaces your bladder with an external one) had a high chance of contracting the lichen sclerosus near the areas that the skin was exposed to urine coming from the external bladder. The possible theory is that the urine coming in contact with the skin causes an inflammatory reaction of the organism:  [(PDF) Cytokines expression in lichen sclerosus (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333881129_Cytokines_expression_in_lichen_sclerosus) .  \n\n\nI have also read that male circumcision has a high chance of curing/lessening the symptoms of lichen sclerosis. There is also a study that shows that 70% of patients with phimosis suffer from Lichen Sclerosus :  [(PDF) Lichen Sclerosus and Phimosis \u2212 Discrepancies Between Clinical and Pathological Diagnosis and Its Consequences (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348165550_Lichen_Sclerosus_and_Phimosis_-_Discrepancies_Between_Clinical_and_Pathological_Diagnosis_and_Its_Consequences) ( so my theory is that the phimosis is probably caused by the lichen sclerosus , due to the urine exposure, which in turn makes the skin more susceptible to damage, then it is scarring and in terms making the skin less elastic and shortening it. It may also be the other way, that the phimosis \\[caused by genetic predisposition of the patient\\]causes the urine to come in contact with the skin and causing the lichen sclerosus).   \n\n\nAlso it is found out that male patients have far less chance to develop the lichen sclerosus in the anus area opposed to female patients. Well it makes sense, because males have longer urethra (the penis) and when they pee, the urine doesn't come in contact with the anus area. Females on the other hand have shorter urethra and there is higher probability that the urine will come in contact with their anus areas.  \n\n\nIt turns out that I also suffer from lichen sclerosus and was losing hope in curing it. Since the time I've started to wipe the urine thoroughly after every visit to the toilet I don't even have to use steroids or topical treatments anymore, which at least for me is a proof that the urine causing lichen sclerosis might be the case.   \n\n\nSo seems like the solution would be thorough wiping and disenfecting the areas where the urine might have come in contact with.  \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

I believe I have discovered a simple new plant-based remedy for treating lichen sclerosus and I have come here to share the good news.\n\n\nWARNING: The plant I use contains chemicals which can potentialy act as MAOIs (or REMAs to be more specific) if they enter the bloodstream in sufficient quantities.\u00a0 Please DO NOT use this plant without adequate understanding of what MAOI's do, and please feel free to get more specific info or guidance from me if you intend to use it.\n\n\nLast fall I was diagnosed with lichen sclerosus (LS).\u00a0 Fortunatey I caught on\u00a0to the symptoms fairly fast and at the time of diagnosis I had only just begun to experience relatively mild tissue damage and sexual/urinary dysfunction.\u00a0 I did however have all the other classic symptoms like figure 8 shaped pigment loss, pain, itching, shrinking of skin in areas affected by pigment loss, plaque-like raised bumps/growths on skin, and more..\u00a0 It was a pretty scary situation to be in, as I'm sure many of you know.\u00a0\n\n\nI was prescribed the standard treatment with topical steroid creams, however after researching them I decided to hold off on the big pharma drugs (I never ended up even picking up the Rx) and instead I began experimenting with using my favorite medicinal plant\u00a0Peganum harmala, in spite of the fact that my searches of the internet revealed no evidence of anyone ever trying to treat LS with\u00a0P. harmala.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nLong story short:\u00a0 I used organic food-grade 190proof ethanol to make an ethanolic tincture of\u00a0P. harmala\u00a0seeds, removed &gt;95% of the ethanol via specialized vacuum-assisted low-temp distillation apparatus to get a full-spectrum\u00a0P. harmala\u00a0extract, then I melted it together with some coconut oil and was able to use the resulting salve ALONE(no other lifestyle/dietary changes or anything)\u00a0to eleminate/reverse ALL of the frightening and uncomfortable symptoms of my LS with the exception of a small patch of skin which has\u00a0not quite\u00a0completely finished regaining all of its pigment\u00a0yet.\u00a0 Improvement in most of my symptoms began within the first week of treatment but the return of normal pigment was a slower process than the otherst..\n\n\nI mimicked the standard dosing instructions for treating LS with topical steroids by starting with a high frequency of application (once in the morning and once at night) and eventually tapering down the frequency as symptoms improved.\u00a0 I currently usually use it once every few days.\u00a0 \n\nAfter the first few weeks of using my cream twice daily with only positive results I experimented with applying the cream 4 -6 times daily for about a week with no side effects before returning back to the standard dosing schedule.  I also experimented with varrying potencies of the cream and found that too high of a concentration of my harmala extract in the salve(or lack of adequate mixing to distribute the harmala extract into the carrier oil) sometimes resulted in what appeared to be slight skin irritation which caused no discomfort and healed quickly.\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough I do not take any medications that could interact with MAOI's I did do some experiments with consuming tyramine heavy meals and caffeine while using overly generous amounts of this salve on my genital region and I experienced no noticeable effects that would indicate MAOI activity of my salve via this delivery method and dosage.\u00a0 I do however still find it necessary to give these special MAOI warnings out of an abundance of caution.\n\n\nBecause of the potential risks of MAOI interactions, it is worth noting that certain areas of the body such as the temples, palms, and soles of the feet are known for being able to absorb things from the skin into the bloodstream much more easily and efficiently than other regions of skin.\u00a0 \n\nMany years ago when I was looking for a better way to treat symptoms of my palmoplantar keratoderma I soaked my feet in an alcohol tincture that I made from P. harmala seeds.\u00a0 About ten minutes or less into my first foot soaking experience I began to feel an undeniably potent and uplifting euphria from the transdermal MAOI activity.\u00a0 \u00a0** If I had foolishly ingested something that has a negative interaction with MAOIs that day then my exerience could have been a very unpleasant and potentially DEADLY one!**\u00a0 \u00a0(side note- the daily harmala foot soaks work great for treating the symptoms of my palmoplantar keratoderma and the euphoric effects were only really strong that first time.)\n\n\nIf anyone made it through all that and is interested in trying to treat their LS with the salve I described above, it is possible to preare it without the use of specialized vacuum-assisted distillation equipment.\u00a0 I simply use the special equipment because I already have it and it makes the process much easier and more efficient for me.\u00a0 The journal article in the link below describes a simple method for preparing a similar harmala salve which can be replicated fairly easily in any kitchen.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2156587214566867?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\n\n\nThe part you really want from the journal article is just this:\n\n\n\"product was prepared according to traditional treatise. Thus the plant material (1 kg of the seeds) was macerated in 6 times water (6 L) for 24 hours, boiled till the half of the water evaporated. The filtered extract then mixed with the same volume of olive oil (3 L) then boiled till all the aqueous part evaporated\"\n\n\n\nI really hope this info can help other people as much as it helped me.\u00a0 Good luck, and stay positive!\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n-the anonymous ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology enthusiast", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit":

found many journal articles that provided evidence suggesting a strong link between LS and the Borrelia bacteria which cause lyme disease, but one article in particular caught my attention because it describes a relatively new immunohistochemically assisted microscopy technique pioneered by the authors which they call focus-floating microscopy(FFM).\u00a0 This new technique appears to be much more effective at detecting Borrelia bacteria compared to the standard borrelia specific PCR tests.\n\nThe article is titled\u00a0Possible Role of Borreliaburgdorfi Sensu Lato in Lichen Sclerosus Patients, published on the 1st of May 2008 by the Journal of the American Medical Association(JAMA).\n\nHere is a brief summary of their findings:\n\nIn this study, the authors reported that with\u00a0their\u00a0new FFM technique they detected Borrelia spirochetes in 38 of the 60(63%) archived human tissue samples from LS patients which they were analyzing!\n\nUnfortunately, they were only able to perform B.burgdorferi specific PCR analysis on 11 of their 60 archived LS samples due to technical problems with the storage of archival materials and 1\u00a0of these 11 cases did not have enough material for FFM after PCR).\u00a0\u00a0However, they found that\u00a0none of their 11 LS specimens which they tested for borreliosis via PCR \ncame back positive while 6 of 10 of those same LS cases was positive via FFM analysis.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAn earlier study by the same authors found that when compared to standard PCR tests for detecting B. burgdorferi sensu lato in classic cutaneous Borreliosis cases, their FFM technique was not only far more sensitive (45% positive identification for PCR vs. 95% with FFM) but it was also almost equally specific (100% w/PCR vs. 99% w/ FFM).\n\n\n\nI'm curious how many LS patients in this group have either been diagnosed with lyme disease, or strongly suspect they have it.\u00a0", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false,

Just last week i only noticed the white spots on my labia minora and i freaked out, did the google md thing, and made an appointment w my gyno. I didn\u2019t like what I read online about LS, but  didn\u2019t want to diagnose myself... well at my appointment the LS diagnosis wasn\u2019t shocking. My doctor said it wasn\u2019t really common for my age and doesn\u2019t get many patients who have it but it\u2019s not too uncommon. He said i didn\u2019t need to get a biopsy and he didn\u2019t recommend it right now because he is pretty certain it\u2019s LS. I\u2019m on clob now and he said after the treatment, discuss what\u2019s next if it doesn\u2019t get better. \n\ni have been feeling down since then, but I\u2019m glad i found this sub because your posts seem positive and I\u2019m thankful for the tips.   I am on clob and I\u2019ll start working on diet changes. Do the spots go away (is that it flaring up?) or does the steroid treatment just stop it from becoming worse? \n\nFor diet I\u2019m planning to try vegan again, i saw some GF posts as well.

I\u2019ve struggled with irritation for years and years and briefly wondered about it 4 years ago but it was quickly brushed off by my OBGYN at the time. Last summer I went to the OBGYN for irritation yet again, and they said it was likely to be dermatitis rather than an infection, which felt like life changing info. They gave me a steroid ointment and I felt mostly better, but still had a ton of redness and always felt like I was on the verge of irritation so they finally referred me to the derm.\n\nSo I just applied my first dose of clob and have been researching LS for the last hour or so. I should feel relieved to finally know what\u2019s going on, but I feel hopeless, disgusting and ashamed now. Every health website describes it as a lifelong condition with possible permanent scarring/damage (and I\u2019m so mad that the damage could have been done in the 4 years it\u2019s been since I initially wondered about LS). It seems like I\u2019ll have to use the clob forever and that it can have side effects that cause other sources of irritation like infection. I really feel like I\u2019ll have to deal with this forever and never have a normal sex life and like my whole life will have to revolve around doing everything I can to avoid flare ups. I\u2019m thinking back to everyone I\u2019ve had sex with over the past few years, especially recently, and wondering if it was noticeable to them and thinking I must\u2019ve completely disgusted them.\n\nBasically it just seems like there\u2019s not a ton of hope and it\u2019s really getting me down.

I am going to the doc next week.\n\nAnyways, I did some research and finally decided that I had LS. I read quite a few things on the internet and I think I read somewhere that LS, if untreated for a long time, causes the head to start merging with the shaft (coz the skin starts getting tight). I'm not sure if this is true or not.\n\nI don't know whether I am biased or not, but it really looks like a small bit under the head is kinda merged with the shaft, while the rest of it has a really sharp edge, if that makes sense. Also, the botto, part of the head has gone a lighter color (almost white) compared to the top part of the head. Is this really due to LS, or just my anatomy? And is this reversible?\n\nSorry if these type of questions are not allowed. I'm not even 100% sure if this is LS, but it really really looks like it.

Started with common symptoms like itching, pain, phimosis and skin-tearing and that's when I went to seek medical attention. My first doctor didn't know what it was but gave me an antifungal cream which for some reason removed most of the symptoms and then referred me to a dermatologist who diagnosed me with LS and prescribed me with a strong topical corticosteroid cream. From this point on, I have never had any \"flares\" with the first symptoms again (itching, pain, etc.) but I still used the cream because of white spots and red (inflamed) areas of the skin. However, after having used this cream for like three years, my skin had been thinned out a lot and that's when I went to a new dermatologist who told me to stop use the cream (for some reason the first dermatologist, who I went to see a few times a year, didn't notice this...) He also saw that I had a quite severe case of skin adhesions (basically the foreskin attaches to the glans) and so he referred me to an urologist who thought that a circumcision would be a good option for me. Having had all these problems for so many years (thinned-out skin as well as the skin adhesions) I decided to go through with the procedure. I am now into the healing phase of circumcision.\n\n**My questions:**\n\nSo, now to my questions. I'm still healing from the circumcision but I wondered about how the circumcision will affect the state of my LS? Is there any guys out there who have went through with circumcision and gotten rid of the LS? Has it gotten worse? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am sorry if this is not the right place for this post. I am fairly new to Reddit and could not find a subreddit (?) for only male cases of LS and understand if this post is completely irrelevant to some of you females out there (which I have read are more likely to get LS). \n\nThanks in advance for any answers!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1213, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Lichen Sclerosus Male Circumcision", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/mhyit4/lichen_sclerosus_male_circumcision/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lkwoycmv385", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_asl9qysd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1617288734, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/mhwzgq/ls_on_anus/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mhwzgq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/mhwzgq/ls_on_anus/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1617288744, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI was diagnosed with LS on my vulva, but I'm wondering people's experience with it on their anus?

I used it and it got better and I stopped and didn\u2019t think anything of it. Fast forward, I love lifting and me and my friend decided to try SARMS which is somewhat like a steroid. WORST mistake of my whole life and I haven\u2019t been the same since.

She\u2019s tried to help me and all I do is try to put on a fake happiness that it\u2019s getting better and I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m in my last semester of school and idk how I can have a full 8 hour job everyday in this much discomfort. What girl is ganna want me?

At least girls can get sympathy but I\u2019m supposed to be a strong guy, what girl is ganna want a guy like this. How can I do this. The only relief is when I put clobetosol all over my head, but I can\u2019t keep doing this it\u2019ll thin my skin off. Literally the day I stop clobetosol it gets way worse again and my head starts to look more bruised. It\u2019s only the head of my penis that\u2019s uncomfortable. I\u2019m on my last legs. I\u2019ve lost 25 pounds and lost a ton of my muscle I\u2019ve worked years for. I\u2019m eating everything organic, no diary or gluten. My diet is bland as can be. I just bought 4 pairs of expensive silk underwear for 170$. I\u2019m buying all the most expensive shit I can find trying to be as healthy as humanly possible but nothing helps.

I\u2019ve always been the happiest guy in the room and now am on the verge of depression. Id love life if I could just get this shit to stop hurting and burning all the time.

What else should I be using to help speed this along and prevent future flares? What other tips do you all have? What are the best menstrual products? I cant use a cup because I have an iud. Do you shave? I feel like the hair is irritating me but I don't was to aggravate it more.\nBoth my gyne and gp seemed like this was no big deal and the clobetasol will fix everything right away... I just feel like this is never going to end!\nThank you all for your opinions!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1170, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Will I EVER get over this flare?!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/m6p4p1/will_i_ever_get_over_this_flare/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "marlen94", "author_cakeday": true, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5y29191y", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1615912721, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/m6d8ch/the_clob/", "gildings": {}, "id": "m6d8ch", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/m6d8ch/the_clob/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1615912732, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey is it normal for clob to stop working?

I\u2019ve been a silent sufferer of LS for about 5 years now. It\u2019s hard to talk about because a lot of people don\u2019t know what it is and I feel if they did they may be grossed out. I was so excited when I found out there is a Reddit forum dedicated to this and reading some of the post I don\u2019t feel so alone anymore! I just wanted to share something that helps me so much during a really bad flare up. I understand that some may have different opinions or maybe can even teach me something if it\u2019s something I shouldn\u2019t be doing but I\u2019ve been using it for the past year and it helps tremendously.\n\nI was prescribed a series of steroids and celob thinned my skin out so much. It left me feeling dry and almost like I needed to keep putting more. My skin felt like paper. I finally ditched the celob because I wanted something that gave me instant relief. ESP when I\u2019m waking up in the middle of the night soooo itchy I can\u2019t even fall back to sleep!! I\u2019ve tried emu oil and that seems to only cool things down or speed up the healing process if my skin becomes basically raw. The best thing I stumbled upon and swear on next may sound strange to some but hear me out... preparation H rapid relief with lidocaine... LIFE SAVER. I had some left over and one night I was thinking to myself I just wish I couldn\u2019t feel anything down there! Then I seen the PH tube on the counter and in a desperate moment I lightly rubbed some onto the *outer* lips only. When I tell you guys, instant relief!!!\n\nI now swear by this stuff! I always keep some. When I have a horrible flare up I rub it on before the shower, before bed or whenever I have that nagging itch and it literally numbs the area I can\u2019t feel a thing. It\u2019s like a mute button LOL. It helps so that I\u2019m not further irritating the area and it gets a chance to heal and the rash goes away. Within 2-3 days I don\u2019t even need to use it until I have another flare up.\n\nI noticed caffeine, alcohol &amp; PMS are flare ups for LS. I try to stay away from these but it\u2019s so relieving knowing I came across something I don\u2019t have to go to the doctor for, it doesn\u2019t thin my skin out, etc. if you do decide to try this please do not place it on the inner area. I only use it on the outside of my effected area. I am no doctor obviously so this is just me sharing something that worked for me hoping it may help someone else. Another thing I think is irritating it further is shaving. I\u2019m considering doing laser hair removal and still researching if that would help alleviate any symptoms.

Thank you so much for this community! I\u2019ve been reading so much in here and now I\u2019ve decided to make a post because I strongly suspect my little girl has LS. \n(Btw I truly apologize for any grammar mistakes beforehand since I\u2019m Scandinavian and English is my second language.) \n\nWarning really long post!\n\nIn late February my 9 year old daughter had a lot of itchiness down there and I just put on some yogurt thinking it was some typical yeast- thing (my mother used to do the same thing to me when I was a little girl and it always worked ). When that didn\u2019t work I tried to let her sit a couple of days with some white vinegar diluted in water, I had found that instruction on NHS\u2019 website, but to no avail. (please don\u2019t judge me I tried natural remedies first and didn\u2019t know any better\ud83d\ude1e). \n\nThen one night, I see that she actually has a reddish pink sharply demarcated plaque on her labia majora and clitoral hood that is shaped almost like a an almond or a key hole. It starts on top of the clitoral hood and it ends just below her vagina, it doesn\u2019t exceed down to the perianal part. Her skin was also very very crinkled and scaly and super dry, and on her clitoral hood she had two little porcelain white raised, smooth hard papules along with a small raw patch and two deep cuts at the entrance to her vagina. \n\nSo I called the doctor who, because of COVID, didn\u2019t want to see her but just prescribed her a mild steroid cream over the phone and said it sounded like yeast. Because I had heard so much about steroids being \u2018dangerous\u2019 and because I felt unsafe with the doctor prescribing it without even looking at my daughter, I decided to wait and see. \n\nI called again a couple of days later and this time insisted that the doctor took a look at her because I had googled and Lichen Sclerosis kept showing up in my search results, and so we got an appointment after both getting the mandatory COVID tests that would allow her to be seen in the clinic. \n\nAt the clinic my doctor (another one) started out by saying that Lichen Sclerosis is VERY rare in young girls (even though I had read that it wasn\u2019t THAT rare but okay) and she took a look and did some swaps with q-tips to test for bacteria. She said she also suspected yeast, because there was also quite some pungent smell. I on the other hand suspected LS from the moment I found it online. The doctor said that I should use the mild steroid cream and call back when the test results came back. \n\nI used the cream for 10 days and the test results had come back all clear but her patch had now turned really pale pink. I told my doctor that I really wanted a referral to a clinic I found online that specializes in vulva diseases including LS, but she didn\u2019t want to give me that because she said it could be something else than LS, so instead she sent me to the pediatric department at our local hospital even though I disagreed because I was so sure it was LS (at this point I had googled every day all day 24/7 and cried many tears). \n\nI was afraid that it would be a waste of precious time and I was worried about the loss of architecture I had read so much about. \n\nAnd so today we had our appointment at the pediatric department at the hospital and I\u2019m sitting here so sad because it was exactly how I imagined. \n\nFirst of all the doctor starts out by saying that she never sees girls with LS only boys and she doesn\u2019t know why that is, besides the fact that \u2018it\u2019s super rare in little girls\u2019. Then she looks at my daughter\u2019s genitals for literally 8 seconds and then asks me about our treatment with the steroid cream, how long she was on it etc. She then brings up pinworms because they itch at night and I tell her that I\u2019m familiar with those and it\u2019s not that. \n\nI then show her pictures I\u2019ve taken to document my daughter\u2019s condition and on some of the pictures I\u2019ve managed to gently pull back the clitoral hood and on the clitoris you can see some swelling and a white patch along with something that looked like a flake of dead white skin which I had then tried to remove (gently with a clean napkin but decided to leave it to not make anything worse).\n\nThe doctor reacted to those pictures and said \u2018there\u2019s swelling hmm... wow it\u2019s really good you have those pictures\u2019 and I\u2019m like -\u2018aren\u2019t you going to examine her clitoris ?\u2019 and she crosses her arms and is visibly uncomfortable and just says that she won\u2019t do that it\u2019s too invasive or something like that. \n\nAnd then she says that she wants to do a biopsy in anesthesia because she suspects LS and my heart stops because I\u2019ve read EVERYWHERE that biopsy isn\u2019t recommended on little children!? \n\nAnd then I ask \u2018local anesthesia?\u2019 and she says \u2018no, general anesthesia\u2019. And I say \u2018but she\u2019s only 9?\u2019 and then the doctor said \u2018no she\u2019s a big girl and it\u2019s only a little piece\u2019. And I\u2019m just shaking inside and I repeatedly express to her how hard this decision is for me, especially since she hasn\u2019t really looked at my child but wants to order a biopsy based on a picture I just happen to have?? \n\nShe said she wants to make sure that my daughter actually has LS since the treatment is \u2018strong steroid cream twice a day for up to 6 months\u2019 (her exact words - which also confused me because I had read everywhere that it was only 2x a day for a month, 1x a day for another month and then a couple of times pr. week for the last month). \n\nThen she says that as an alternative she can refer me to a dermatologist since they\u2019re more experienced with LS and maybe they can diagnose my daughter without needing to do a biopsy. But she couldn\u2019t guarantee that a biopsy wouldn\u2019t be needed eventually. And so I said that I would like a referral to the vulva clinic I mentioned earlier and she hesitantly said that she would give me that and told me that my daughter must\u2019ve had the patch longer than February I just haven\u2019t noticed. :(\n\nI left feeling sick to my stomach because I felt so uninformed and confused and had to explain to my daughter why the doctor didn\u2019t really examine her, since we had a talk yesterday about what was going to happen today. I just told her that she\u2019s going to the real experts this time but I\u2019m just so sad and scared. \n\nI am completely 100% on board with getting a proper diagnosis before starting the strong steroid treatment but I really couldn\u2019t agree to an invasive biopsy with my little 9 year old daughter having to undergo general anesthesia when the doctor haven\u2019t even examined her AT ALL? If they feel like a biopsy is necessary after a thorough exam at the vulva clinic then it\u2019s something completely different. \n\nThis whole experience has just been awful and everyday as I\u2019m putting on almond/olive oil and mild fatty lotions on my daughter I just pray for this to go away but it won\u2019t and I feel like this is my fault for keeping the toilet paper in a storage room along with (100% closed) paint and utensils etc. and I also used to keep cleaning products in the bathroom next to the toilet roll\ud83d\ude13\n\nWe live in the city in a super small apartment and her older sister and I have never had anything down there no itchiness or cuts or anything and we\u2019ve lived here all their life, it\u2019s just so hard to make room for things and the thought of something like this happening had never crossed my mind\ud83d\ude13.\n\nI\u2019ve always used non-perfumed detergent and never washed her with soap down there either and the shower gel and soap is organic and mostly non-scented, so the storage is the only thing I can think of that I must have done wrong\ud83d\ude13. \n\nI\u2019ve since then removed everything and educated myself 1000% to help her through this. I\u2019m just heartbroken and I\u2019m seeking advice from all you wonderful people. And again please don\u2019t judge me for my mistakes I wish more than anything that I had stored things separately.\n\nCan I ask what your opinions are about our situation? \n\nTLDR: Would you feel that a diagnosis for a 9 year old girl could be possible to obtain without a biopsy? And if not, do you think that is was okay for me to wait with the biopsy until she\u2019s had a thorough exam?

The years leading up to having a baby I started to experience painful sex and once I got pregnant sex became very uncomfortable like nearly impossible. Obvi while pregnant my OB is doing many exams of the vaginal area and never brings anything abnormal up. It\u2019s not until my first POSTARTUM visit that my OB explains to me that I have labial fusion. (I ended up having a cesarean for unrelated reasons). \n\nMy first thought is \u201chow can you be telling me I have labial fusion now?\u201d I mean she\u2019s been looking at my vagina for months and not one word (yes I complained about painful sex to her in the past). \n\nAnyways, she tells me I have LS and prescribes me the Clob. Tells me there\u2019s not a lot of hope that the clob will fix the fusion, but should help prevent it from getting worse. Then she tells me to see a uro gynecologist who takes one look at me and says \u201cyep, you have LS\u201d and pretty much I\u2019m going to be on the clob forever and surgery won\u2019t help bc it will just fuse again. \n\nI joined a LS support group on FB and found a great doctor in my area...essentially he\u2019s \u201cthe lichen doc\u201d and after an exam he tells me I don\u2019t have LS, but that my painful sex problem is coming from vestibulutis. \n\nI am now SUPER CONFUSED. the doctors that told me I have LS are Northwestern doctors! I end up finding a vulvar specialist at University of Chicago who tells me that she doesn\u2019t think I have LS given my symptoms (no itching, but just white patches, thin skin, etc) but only a biopsy will tell. I also saw a labial fusion specialist at UofC that also told me she doubts I have LS but that I can have surgery but would need to be off the clob for at least 2 months....clob can actually give you LS looking symptoms... it thins your skin, can make it white, etc. the reason I would need to be off of the clob is to make sure my skin is healthy and plump and prepared to withstand surgery. \n\nI\u2019ve now been off the clob for about 4 months and in that time my labia has returned to its normal color, no more white/thin skin. And just yesterday I had my labial fusion surgery AND they did a biopsy (I was asleep so may as well), and turns out the biopsy confirmed that I do not have LS. Also I saw an AMAZING pelvic floor PT that has really helped my vestibulitis/painful sex problem and that is no longer an issue. \n\nIf there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve learned is to get a second and even a third option when dealing with any disorder, but especially LS bc so many docs just tell u something based off how something looks. Even if you go to a really great hospital group... literally Northwestern is one of the best in the country but two doctors there were completely wrong! \n\nThis post is not to brag about not having LS. It\u2019s just that I wish someone would have told me this when my first doc told me that\u2019s what I have.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1144, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Get 2nd and 3rd opinions!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/lx7dg6/get_2nd_and_3rd_opinions/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "karawhipsass", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3m6bzszt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1614787707, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/lwxfql/punch_biopsy/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lwxfql", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/lwxfql/punch_biopsy/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1614932481, "score": 1, "selftext": "I get a biopsy at the end of the month.

I could use some support right now, feeling a bit overwhelmed right now.\n\nI \\[29F\\] currently have a tentative diagnosis of LS. I first went to my GP late 2020 and she said that while I have some LS symptoms, it doesn't look textbook, so it could be a lot of things. I have a white patch of thicker skin on the left side of my clitoris. I don't have any itching, burning, or inflammation. She prescribed me really mild corticosteroid cream and I used that (along with a lot of vaseline) for 4 weeks. It didn't do much. She referred me to a gyno/derm, whom I will be seeing late March.\n\nThen a few days ago, I discovered a small lump on the top/left of my clitoris, healthy pink-ish in colour, but definitely new. After a bit of catastrophising (lump = cancer, thank you Dr google) I called the gyno who advised me to go to my GP as it wasn't possible to move up my appointment. Unfortunately my GP, who had been my GP for almost 10 year, is specialised in gyno and menstrual issues and whom I feel really comfortable with/trust, left the practice. My new GP's approach seems completely different. During the visual inspection she said that she wasn't sure that it was LS, because other than the white patch, my skin looks very healthy. She thankfully didn't think the lump was anything to worry about. But after the exam, it seemed like she made her mind up that I do have LS and prescribed me a much heavier corticosteroid cream. It feels a bit unsettling that it went from 'hmm not sure' to 'yep LS' in a few minutes. She also didn't take a lot of time to explain it to me and ended the appointment quite quickly.\n\nNow I'm a bit all over the place. My first GP had a plan of action that we were carrying out and the next step was the gyno/derm. The new GP, however, thinks I should start applying the cream once a day immediately and wants to follow up with me in two weeks to see if it has had any effect. Will it be harmful to use the cream if I don't have LS? Has anyone else had a little lump appear due to LS? It feels a bit like I have two different plans of action from two different doctors. I guess I will follow the new GP's plan as she has the most up to date information but the difference in approaches is a bit jarring. And I'm still a bit worried about the lump.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone is able to answer any of those questions but it feels good to have typed this out. I would love to hear any similar or totally different diagnosis stories! Any thoughts or suggestions would also be really appreciated!\n\n\\[TLDR: Slight freak out about potential LS diagnosis and different approaches by different doctors.\\]\n\nEdit to correct who/whom - haha thanks RossGellerBot", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1136, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tentative diagnosis and confused about different approaches from different doctors", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ltl2va/tentative_diagnosis_and_confused_about_different/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "jon11a", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_12hmzi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1614392192, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ltdw3a/worried_about_biopsy/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ltdw3a", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ltdw3a/worried_about_biopsy/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1614485024, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m 41(M) and have had lichen sclerosis diagnosed for about ten years.

Sometimes it\u2019s noticeable other times not as much. \n\nRecently it changed to looking a lot redder and I\u2019ve also experienced some discomfort there which I\u2019ve never had before.

I decided to google it and am horrified. \n\nSo I am reading through these posts and people are saying how they manage it but I don't see any about how exactly do you manage it? I don't have any white spots or fusing and I don't have any tearing or redness now so how do you anticipate sex being painful still? \n\nI also have had an anal fissure since shortly after giving birth and am wondering if this is why it never healed properly. Maybe all my skin in my genital region is thin and weak. \n\nI guess I'm just looking for insight as to how you know when it may be okay to have sex? Are white spots a requirement of the diagnosis?

Just wanted to confess this in advance. Two different Gynecologists have said that my labia looks like there is \u201cLichen Sclerosus\u201d. (This will only be justified once I get a biopsy, I know).\n\nA doctor has mentioned that he already sees \u201ca little bit of fusion between my labia and clitoris\u201d. However I can still have clitoris stimulation. I still have feeling and I can somewhat easily orgasm from clitoral stimulation. The only thing is, in recent times sometimes my clitoris hurts (as If it\u2019s bruising) .But I\u2019ve never had a vaginal penetration orgasm. If I do have LS, would that be the reason why?\n\nAlso, I keep reading that women have \u201cflare ups\u201d \u201citching\u201d, and occasionally using ice packs. But I don\u2019t have any of those symptoms. In fact I don\u2019t have any pain or discomfort. The only symptom are fine white patches on my labia and a little bit of a shiny coat, and, if I stretch my vagina sideways I can feel a pulling motion; the same feeling like skin being really stretched out.\n\nOverall, not only am I confused but I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m worried that my clitoris will be fused into my labia that I won\u2019t be able to ever have an orgasm! I\u2019m scared that I won\u2019t have a good sex life. I\u2019m also scared that receiving oral sex will never be possible.\n\n\nIf someone could send me a DM or tell me here more about LS, I would really appreciate it.\nThank you so much!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1123, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "First time here.

I am 28/F, diagnosed via biopsy at age 24. I initially had the biopsy done because I had two U.S. quarter-sized white patches (symmetrically placed) on my shoulders/upper back and I was about to get married and wanted to get rid of them (I thought they were fungal). Went to the dermatologist and they were really weirded out that the biopsy from my shoulder showed lichen sclerosus but I had no presentation on my genitals at that time. They used to be white and papery thin, now they\u2019ve browned and look like freckle clusters.\n\nSince then, I have developed symptoms in the typical \u201cfigure 8\u201d perianal/vulvar region, it\u2019s actively flaring and progressing, and I have developed some other weird symptoms (severe lower back pain, extreme fatigue, long-term low-grade fever, etc.) that I feel may to point to a connected autoimmune issue. I have not been tested for any other autoimmune diseases.\n\nAll this to say, I always thought it was weird that my LS started where it did, and I have always wondered if it reveals something about what\u2019s going on in my body.

It's a pretty simple inquiry I have but can't find the answer on Google:  \n\n\n1) Does urine irritate/ burn LS effected skin? whatever IS wrong with me, it's kind of a constant burning. Sometimes (thank god) there is no pain. sometimes it burns badly. But when urine passes over it, the urine increases the burn sensation/irritates it. Being absolutely meticulous about drying off after peeing has helped a bit.\n\n Yes I see white thin skin, but this part of my penis was also subject to a pretty heavy sex-injury which I never allowed to properly heal. So that leads to my 2nd question.\n\n2) From anyone's experience or knowledge, could LS possibly arise from a previous injury which damaged the genital skin? Autoimmune issues in my case are a distinct possibility as I drank constantly when this started. Only now am i (for once and for all) taking my health seriously.\n\nThanks!

I'm the newest camper in this great LS adventure...\n\nFrom what I have read, some of you suffer a lot more than I do, but still this is worrying as hell. I still have no major issues with my genitals functions so far, so I really have no right to complain. Nonetheless, good luck to you all and here is my little story so far.\n\nNoticed some white skin on the tip of my glans about 2 years ago. It was still smooth and not painful, maybe some loss of pigment I thought. Then several months ago, I noticed that the inside of my foreskin that was actually touching the white patch when pulled on the glans had developed a spot of raised and scarred tissue down along the frenulum. I was a bit freaked out, but since I don't like to go waste my time at the doctor, i decided to wait it out (because from experience I found that they can help you only if you have SUPER OBVIOUS symptoms...).  Anyway this caused me no trouble for sex or peeing, so I tried to stay cool about it. Then a couple months ago, a red stain appeared in the white patch, starting at the bottom of the piss slit and going down following the urethra under the glans and stopping at the frenulum, as if there was blood under the skin. Some parts darker red and others brighter red, and changing a bit depending on the days also. So that was it, something was wrong enough with my bits to go see a doctor now.\n\nI had to wait a few weeks to get an appointment, so that gave me time to scour the internet for info, obviously (we all try to self-diagnose don't we?). Reading about LS made me realize that I also had a few anus itching episodes that i had no explanation for and also that my pee slit had scarred very slightly at the top (a bit inside the slit). I sometimes had an annoying spray instead of a clean stream, making a mess around the toilet when I do not sit, and I always thought it was just occasionally sticky or something, but I guess it has been sneakily scarring for a while now.\n\nAnyway, I saw my general practitioner and she referred me to a dermatologist which I saw 3 weeks ago. She looked at my bits for less than 10 seconds and said \"That's Lichen sclerosis, it's fairly common to man and woman alike. We don't want it to spread so I will prescribe you strong cortisone ointment and we'll have a follow-up appointment in two months to see the evolution\". She also said that this requires a possible lifetime maintenance of putting cortisone ointment two times a week.\n\nConsidering I am stressed AF about it... I was a bit shocked at how unimpressed and nonchalant she seemed to be. I prefer woman doctors in general because they seem to be more caring and have more empathy in general, but I think I would have preferred a man here. Surely any man would know that learning that your dick is being attacked by some disease that you will fight for the rest of your life is something you need to be supportive about. Sorry if that is stupid or sexist, I'm just sharing my gut feeling.\n\nSo...... Right off the bat (pun intended) I have several questions popping in my head.\n\n\\- I have had very mild burning sensations when peeing, but I did not mention it to the doctor yet  because it was very occasional. Could this be damage to the urethra? Also, can the urethra heal by itself if I manage to heal whats visible from the outside, on the glans and foreskin?\n\n\\- The cortisone ointment is pretty greasy (like vaseline). Is it advised to put your foreskin back on after applying it? I feel like this would prevent glans and foreskin to ever breath through their natural skin if the ointment doesn't ever have a chance to \"dry\" or \"wear off\". Did any of you have had the same kind of cream to apply?\n\n\\- I often have some weird sensations just above the pubic area. I thought it might be intestinal, but I am starting to think that maybe it could be my bladder. Am I tripping out or is it possible for LS to go all the way and attack the bladder?\n\n\\- Bonus question : Isn't BXO just the name for the male version of LS? Or is this a different disease?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, thank you for reading if you made it all the way through. Looking forward to chat about it.\n\nCheers!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 653, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My story and a few questions", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/g7nzpb/my_story_and_a_few_questions/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "missmpa", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6alrwjpq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1587737277, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/g78zjv/recent_diagnosis_of_ls_and_feeling_alone/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g78zjv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/g78zjv/recent_diagnosis_of_ls_and_feeling_alone/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1587737287, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am a female and a nurse spotted it in November 2019.

I have recently been diagnosed with this unfortunate  condition. I've long suspected that I had it but was unable to access  medical care. A few months before I had my first appointment I began  having very bad flare ups much worse than anything I had experienced previously. Even using my usual sensitive skin fragrance free soap would  cause burning. I already had noticeable changes in appearance before  this flare up which I had gotten used to and was making peace with.  However, things have completely changed for the worse since. My skin  thinned very badly and I lost structure, as well as more drastic changes  in color, tightening, and decreased sensation. I also experience daily  pain and tenderness. I feel as though I don't have a vagina anymore. My  vagina seemed otherwise normal aside from appearance previously but now  it doesn't even seem functional and I don't know what other problems I  will run into.\n\nI already had  depression but after this happened I fell into a very deep depressive  episode and whenever I think about my vagina or look at it I become  incapacitated with anxiety. I am in my twenties and a virgin and now I  am unsure of how I will ever loose my virginity, experience the sex life  I always wanted, or find a partner. If anyone ever got into a  relationship with me I would feel guilty. Right now I am venting but I  also want to know if there is any hope. I've never felt this overwhelmed  and helpless before and I have no idea what to do or how to go forward.

Just that made a huge difference..it can be 90% sometimes because the other 10% will be elastane(waist band). Then I started washing them separately with very mild soap that contained no dies or perfumes and didn't use fabric softener. I do not wipe myself anymore after using the washroom...instead I gently pat dry with the softest possible toilet paper. Since doing that, I have not used my clobetasol, it has now been 4 month's.

Hopefully the thread won't be closed.\n\nThe main concerns for me have been: Diagnosis &amp; Conceptualisation, Relationships, Technicalities of Sex, Sensation, Treatments &amp; Therapies, and, more generally, \"what I think is going on\".  I will write a brief par on each. I will try to keep it short!\n\n***Diagnosis***\n\nIn my experience, remember this was 2001, visiting the Consultant Dermatologist at St Mary's and being told I had 'Lichen Sclerosis et Atrophicus' was not good.  The name of this condition is ludicrous, long and inaccurate. It means nothing to a 21 yr old man.  'Lichen' sounds like you've got something growing on you. And the term et Atrophicus should be dropped.  Personally, I think it should be diagnosed \"Sclerosis\" aka scarring.  And then clarified as 'auto-immune sclerosis'. The consultant offered me no information about the condition or how I might try to conceptualise it or what I should do in the future - she just packed me off with a steroid prescription and told me there was no cure. Not the best customer service.\n\n***Relationships***\n\nWhatever is said about relationships in regards LS must be set in the context of sexual relationships of men and women in general. Relationships in one's 20's can be rather liquid; figures show less people are marrying in their twenties and having more than one sexual partner. In my experience it's better to be philosophical about relationships, and not ladle everything onto LS. Early-20s relationships are a complete shit-show for many people without LS, not all, but for many!  Don't forget all the stuff that's great about relationships apart from sex: walks on the beach, romantic kisses, and so on. The prevalence of porn has got everyone thinking that sex is all about having beautiful genitals - and while I am sad that I never had a fulfilling porn career - and while that might have been slightly disappointing for my two beautiful partners as well in that decade - we were still able to enjoy sex and all that comes with it.\n\n***Technicalities of Sex*** \n\nThe biggest problem for me personally has been that I have wanted less sex than my partner. I enjoy sex when it comes - and sometimes the sensation is a bit like itching a mosquito bite (ecstatic pleasure and pain combo) - but after sex I have wanted a few days or a week or more off to let my skin recover. Personally, I try and see LS in context. It's not as bad as castration. Not as good as perfect skin. Somewhere in between. I have had a lot of good sex focusing more on the thrusting meaty and bally aspects - as opposed to the tickley or close-up-porn aspects. If your partner is into you they will get on board with your \"quirks\" and you'll find a way to have fun.\n\n***Sensation***\n\nLS is an ongoing / chronic, incurable skin condition, and therefore the job is one of management and making the best of a bad situation. In my experience I have enjoyed normal orgasms and erections, but at the same time I have had to deal with sclerotic legions on my glans and foreskin, which have been painful.\n\n*How my LS progressed, my experience with treatments &amp; therapies*\n\nIn my case, the LS started as a small polyp on the top of my glans, like an alien space ship arriving. From there it sent out thin striations under the skin to new sites where it subsumed the tissue with trauma and sclerosis. Over the decades, and very slowly, those sites became so scarred and the tissue so \"otherized\" that the sclerosis didn't seem to be able to occur any longer. As those sites were finished off new striations were sent to other areas of the glans, which in turn scarred and otherized the surrounding skin.\n\nCircumcision: In my case the LS was so focused on the glans I never wanted to risk circumcision. Penises circumcised at birth naturally remodel themselves during puberty to accept an uncovered state (much how babies remodel all sort of bone breaks and misplacements that adults cannot).  ...It cannot be guaranteed that adults will \"get used\" to the constant rubbing of a circumcised penis. So in my case, I decided I would be happy to tuck my glans away under the foreskin where it would not be rubbed, if I so wished.\n\nSteroid Cream: Meh, I'm glad I've got them as an option - but generally they have been overly pushed by Dermatologists as something useful- when they are not a cure (in my experience) and barely do anything to the underlying LS. I think they are best described as a holding pattern. They ameliorate the effects of the scarring in the short term, but don't address the underlying processes.\n\nImmune Suppressant Cream: Again meh, ok for tinkering in the short term, and better than nothing(!) but nothing to get particularly excited about. I'm glad these creams are available as they can help keep sexual function on the table, but after two decades of LS I am realistic about what they can do.\n\nPRP: I have had three blasts of PRP, and I have been quite pleased by the modulatory effect it has had. Again, it hasn't cured the problem, but it has significantly modulated the problem skin. It seems to have subsumed the sclerotic regions with nicer tissue, and also generally plumped the shaft and meatus which is reassuring. It seems to have energised the tissue in general, and hastened the progress of the sclerosis.\n\n*Finally, \"what I think is going on\"*\n\nI think something like a foreign bacteria arrived on my penis and my immune system overreacted and as well as targeting the bacteria, went on to target the entire penis long after the bacteria was neutralised. But this is total guesswork.\n\nI feel my best bet at the moment is to work with the \\* process \\* of sclerosis that is happening. I am not trying to way lay the sclerosis, but hasten it forward and subsume it with healthy tissue. The scarring is leaving behind perfectly useable 'otherized' tissue which has sensation, albeit it looks a bit white. In my experience dermatologists have placed far too much importance on the blanching effect of the LS, which is nether here nor there in my opinion, and I have found this unhelpful.\n\nI really don't care about the aesthetics of LS, genitals are weird at the best of times. My problem has been with the scarring; the speed at which the sclerotic process occurs (it is too slow); and the pain associated.\n\nI really think the best bet for LS, and an area ripe for research, is how we can accelerate the process of scarring and otherization that is occurring (as opposed to trying to weigh-lay the disease with various creams). Additionally, try to boost the surrounding tissue. I have found PRP shows promise for these aspects - although this is a kind of therapy - not a cure - and it needs to be done regularly - say once every 6 months. Which would be prohibitively expensive for most (at time of writing circa \u00a31200).  PRP with occasional steroid use seems to be beneficial. Additionally, the usual lifestyle alterations; less sugar, better sleep etc. And not overly washing the area, and keeping soap away and allowing the skins natural oils.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwell that's just some thoughts - hope any of this is useful food for though.\n\nBW\n\nS", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 602, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "20 years of LS (21-41 yrs old) - Male", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ffkhz2/20_years_of_ls_2141_yrs_old_male/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Jossiepalsmark", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3xojqxrh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1583677338, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ffd5hr/is_there_a_lichen_sclerosus_awarness_day/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ffd5hr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ffd5hr/is_there_a_lichen_sclerosus_awarness_day/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1583677339, "score": 1, "selftext": "Happy international women's day to all the girls here!

Are there any more accommodations you could think of that a young woman at school might want to be more physically comfortable?\nIs there anything you can think of that I can do to make this easier for her?

I don't want her to feel like a faulty design or something. So often people act like being healthy is a moral issue, like if people were good enough and tried hard enough they wouldn't be sick, you know? She has already shown signs of other autoimmune issues and this kind of seals the deal. I don't want her to think she just didn't try hard enough to be healthy. I want to say the right words that will make her feel empowered to take care of herself and empowered to advocate for herself.\n\nI know I'm kind of rambling. I'm sorry.

Hopefully this is helpful to someone in a similar situation.\n\nBackground:\nMale 36, caucasion, generally healthy, no previous health issues or medications. Uncircumsized; have had a vasectomy. Low but regular alcohol use, some light cannabis use. Frequent exercise.\n\nMy mother has some sort of skin condition, dry itchy skin which reacts poorly to sunlight in the spring and summer. Condition could never be properly diagnosed or resolved and started in her 20s. Arthritis on both sides of the family.\n\nPresentation:\n\n2019 noticed urine flow was weak and there was dribbling after using the bathroom. Asked doctor about it, suspecting prostate, but he said everything looked normal. At this point I began squeezing with my fingers after peeing to empty the remaining urine from the penis (some dribble still is inevitable after standing up from the toilet).\n\nDec 2020 it suddenly became more difficult to orgasm during sex. This was never a problem before. I chalked it up to getting older.\n\nJan 2021 noticed what looked like a friction burn on tip of penis after intercourse. I ignored this entirely believing it was just rough sex without a condom. The tip was red and inflamed. It did not seem to heal properly.\n\nA few weeks later after sex, the skin on the tip of the penis torn quite deeply and began to thicken. The foreskin had begun to tighten and took on a vague whitish band (extremely subtle coloring differences at first). \n\nAnother few weeks past, then during intercourse the frenulum partially tore and I screamed out in pain. My wife became concerned and had me try Canesten suspecting a yeast infection. I used it for about a month without success. Tried Hydrocortisone cream and Vitamin E oil which didn't help either.\n\nAt this point I began some research and realized that this was acquired Phimosis and figured the closest resemblance was LS/BXO. It was so subtle though and the information cited it as rare, so I was skeptical. There were virtually no images online of early phimosis to reference, only images of severe cases.\n\nOver the next 3 months the foreskin got tighter and tighter and the white plaque on the tip of the penis spread, nearly cover the whole surface. The white band on the foreskin was pronounced and easily visible (unmistakable really). Sex was too painful to continue. I was now fairly positive that I had LS and met with a family doctor. He agreed and referred me to a urologist. \n\nAt this point I tried applied coconut oil and taking baking soda baths and found them somewhat helpful, but not curative.\n\nAfter waiting about a month I phoned and found that due to the pandemic we were looking at an 6+ month wait to see a urologist. I contacted my family doctor and he prescribed Taro-clobetasol 0.05%, to use twice daily for 3 months.\n\nThe condition improved slowly but noticeably in the first week. After about the 3rd week the white plaque on the tip and foreskin thinned and the foreskin wasnt as tight. Sensitivity has returned to the affected skin, sex is enjoyable again.\n\nNow, after about 4 weeks of treatment only the whitish/grey/purple color on the tip of the penis still remains and there is some very minor tightness to the foreskin still.\n\nI'll post updates in the future.

\nLong story:\n\nI made these pictures about 9 months ago after I went to a dermatologist and he said it is likely to be Lichen Sclerosus, but I did not get a biopsy. He also recommended me to consider circumcision, but also prescribed me two creams - tacrolimus as well as mometasone, which I could use as I saw fit.\n\nMy symptoms were itchiness, also pain after intercourse which in the past I did not have. I do think that frenulum is less stretchy and that with an erection I can't pull my foreskin as far back as I used to, but this could also just be in my mind. Some time ago my meatus also started itching which scared me a little as I do not want my urethra to get affected.\n\nThe creams and pulling my foreskin back and keeping it dry helped a lot with the immediate symptoms, however, my foreskin still seems a bit tighter than it used to and after intercourse it can hurt a bit. I am not fully pleased with the situation.\n\nWhile initially I was against circumcision, I now think it could be a good choice for me. I went to four different urologists which routinely circumcisions and two of them did not see sufficient evidence of LS, two others did. The creams did make the appearance somewhat better than it is on the pictures I posted, so that might be the reason. Still it made me a bit insecure about the circumcision I booked in about two months. If I indeed have LS I'd rather get a circumcision and likely be done with it rather than having to worry about some pain or itchiness and using creams for the next decades.\n\nDoes it look like LS to you?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1508, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Does this look like LS to you?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ouojsn/does_this_look_like_ls_to_you/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "According_Ambition_6", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_952oltxv", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1627594611, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ou6xyy/brazilian_wax/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ou6xyy", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ou6xyy/brazilian_wax/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1627594622, "score": 1, "selftext": "Anyone crazy enough to do a bikini wax?

I\u2019ve tried the steroid creams in the past and they make things burn so I\u2019m wondering what anyone else uses as a daily lubricant that will not cause yeast? My husband and I have been intimate but have not been able to have sex. I'm scared of the tearing all over again.

Painful. Yes. As you can imagine this has taken away my confidence to relax and have sex and also affected the intimacy with my husband. So, after 3 Mona Lisa treatments, estrogen cream, testosterone cream, heat laser treatments (10 to be exact) and lastly the clob, I was feeling hopeful to have sex last night. I\u2019ve been in clob for 2 weeks (2x a day) and was going to taper off for the  next two weeks (1x per day). So god forbid, I had sex last night \u2026.and here I am back the beginning. Skin tore and it\u2019s like everything I have done over the past year+ didn\u2019t matter.  Maybe it\u2019s because the skin was thin from the steroids. Will this ever change? Will I ever heal?

I\u2019m 23 and it started when I was 15/16.the head of my penis started flaking and I was young and dumb and made the worst mistake of my life to peel the skin off. Now one side of my glans looks under developed and ridiculous. It looks like a chunk of skin was torn off and that\u2019s because it basically was. From there things got horrible. Hard white skin would slowly spread and still is to this day. The skin on one part of my gland is so frail and thin. It looks awful. Blotchy, red, brown, white. I\u2019ve been to dermatologists, urologists and one actually made it worse. I\u2019m losing hope. Never been with a girl because of this and it\u2019s so embarrassing. Self conscious about this and my size. My self esteem is Garbage. I just want to be able to have a normal sex life but my penis looks like a freak show. Some days I\u2019m so sad and depressed about it. I was very healthy I use to lift weights, blah blah blah. Now I\u2019m a fat slob. I\u2019ve had skin samples taken and nothing was diagnosed. Id give all the money I have to have a normal looking penis. It looks worse than lots of other LS cases. Maybe it isn\u2019t ls, derms don\u2019t know what it is. What\u2019s the point in living if you are by yourself? When I was young I asked god why he gave me a small penis. Well he showed me it can be much worse.

It worked wonders, all my white patches disappeared and the phimosis (which I had since I have been a child I think?) got way better, too - to the point where I could retract my foreskin easily unerect and \u201chalf-erect\u201d, but not when fully erected. But after just 1 or 2 months I found this to be surprisingly successful. However I stopped the treatment as soon as the cream was empty.\n\nFast forward 7 years to now, not treating it at all for all those years, white patches came back and phimosis worsened a bit again(it\u2019s possible but uncomfortable to retract the foreskin unerect), so I went to a dermatologist who immediately identified the disease and recommended a biopsy and circumcision, no conservative therapy. I insisted on trying a cortisone cream again, and she allowed it, but said I should come back in 3 weeks to do/talk about the biopsy.\n\nI would like to know if you guys had any success with treating LS with creams only, since I thought it went so well 7 years ago, and immediately doing a circumcision seems kind of harsh to me. Especially since I don\u2019t have any symptoms apart from the slight phimosis (which doesn\u2019t create any problems for me during sex etc) and the skin/color doesn\u2019t bother me or my girlfriend.\n\nIn my mind, using a cream for the rest of my life to keep everything in check is less harmful than a biopsy+surgery, but I am also a very anxious person and never had surgery. Still I see more and more articles getting released that say, circumcision should not be done in any case and a recent study apparently said that people are who use corticoid creams have no increased cancer risk.\n\nI would like to know if anyone in this forum have any experience with creams for a long period of time and opted against circumcision or any other input you guys have.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1446, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Case report &amp; question: Any experience with preventing circumcision?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/oey1in/case_report_question_any_experience_with/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "annakatharinuh", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4nwj9mh8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1625521753, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/oeh6d6/could_this_be_ls/", "gildings": {}, "id": "oeh6d6", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/oeh6d6/could_this_be_ls/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1625521764, "score": 1, "selftext": "19, caucasian, Jaydess IUD, Lexapro 15mg, Euthyrox 88\nVitiligo, Hashimoto's disease\n\nAbout a month ago I started to have a reoccuring issue of redness and extreme itching on my vulva.

Likely to be a lengthy post as there's been a few twists and turns in my own personal tale! \n\nBrief history: I suffered with phimosis from birth, until roughly 2 years ago when I was first able to fully retract my foreskin following a stretching regime. 6 months after, some raised white patches appear on my glands, and now cover the majority of the top side (side facing up) . The patches are like the 'wrinkled tissue paper' described in many online and NHS resources, and are quite extensive. Weird thing is I can't can't remember if they were there as soon as I could pull more foreskin back, or developed following this.\n\nI initially thought it was a hygiene issue due not being able to wash properly for 20 odd years so went about trying to keep myself clean, cleaning with water in the shower and using coconut oil as I read this doesn't interfere with natural pH etc. This didn't help so I made a drs appointment. They took a swab of the area which came back clear and told me to try Canesten cream for a few weeks - did this and no change. Follow up appointment I was given Betnovate to use every evening for a month - again no effect.\n\nMy GP then sent some photos to a dermatologist and urologist and both said LS, and was put on Clobaderm for a month, applying once every night. I was also advised to keep the area dry (e.g from urine) and the standard advice of washing/moisturising with a gentle emollient.\n\nI saw some improvement after a month (plaques less pronounced and less white) and was told by my gp to continue for another 2 months applying every evening. I've now come to the end of the time and I feel like I'm no further than when I started treatment.\n\nJust wondering if anyone else is in the same position - I have no itchiness, no redness, my only issue is the extensive white plaque-style pathology that won't go away. I have to admit, I do have issues urinating and tend to be rather messy sometimes (e.g when foreskin has moved around a bit following sex/masturbation/first thing in the morning). And I would say I have slight incontinence issues, like dribbling a little after finishing urinating. I think a combo of keeping my glands dry from urine and clob did lead to some improvement. I also think that keeping my foreskin retracted does reduce the appearance of the plaques (by keeping it dry etc), but isn't a permanent fix.\n\nWould be good to hear from others who have similar, appearance-only issues, and whether you've managed to improve this. \n\nCheers!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1445, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "25 year old male with just appearance issues", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ods0w7/25_year_old_male_with_just_appearance_issues/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "c0lliwog", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3t8vu3sc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1625370811, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/odcpfp/24_yo_m_does_ls_cause_irritation_on_urethra_as/", "gildings": {}, "id": "odcpfp", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/odcpfp/24_yo_m_does_ls_cause_irritation_on_urethra_as/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1625370823, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am undiagnosed with LS currently, but fairly certain I have it. \n\nIt started about a month ago with a skinny shiny white patch on right gland starting near urethra going down.

I have noticed my frenulum seems thinner and more fragile and the end of my glans and frenulum is redder and more irritated. \n\nI am pretty sure this irritation is caused by the clobetasol. Should I stop? Or should I push through despite these side effects?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers":

I\u2019ve been on this board before because I suspected I have what you are all dealing with, which was just confirmed today by a Dermatologist, after 15 months of differential diagnoses such as Post Inflammatory Hypopigmentation from Injury, possible fungal infection etc. And now I finally know where I stand.\n\nI have been given Dermovate and Hydromol (I was already moisturising but she thinks this is a better option for me) so I have some questions.\n\nI would ideally like to start my Dermovate today, but I do have some steroid anxiety. I already hate how my white patch looks, and she has advised me to apply it to that white patch, which is 10 millimetres in size on the glans (my fore skin is fine still, even after a year and a half with no further progression anywhere else). I don\u2019t want it to be even worse, as this will wreck my mind even further, and I have never used such a strong steroid in my life.\n\nI am on a program of 2 times per day for 2 weeks, then 1 time a day for 2 weeks, then alternating days for another 2 weeks. Again, I have not started yet.\n\nIs there a chance I could make things even worse using such a potent ointment? And also, she said the goal of doing this is to get my original colour back to that patch, is this really realistic or not? I also have zero symptoms even to this day, just the colour.\n\nThank you", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1418, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "(M29) Just Diagnosed", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/o7nd4r/m29_just_diagnosed/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "saltyattitudegang90", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_14xrtv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1624600339, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/o7hklc/anyone_had_a_bad_reaction_to_protopic_tacrolimus/", "gildings": {}, "id": "o7hklc", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/o7hklc/anyone_had_a_bad_reaction_to_protopic_tacrolimus/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1624600350, "score": 1, "selftext": "M(22) So I used steroid cream last year (Betamethasone 0.05) for some LS like symptoms but ultimately left it alone as it seemed to be healing mostly on its own.

She told me that it could be a complication from my UTI infection/taking antibiotics, and that it may just clear up on its own. \n\nShe also stated that it could possibly be lichen sclerosus, and gave me clobetasol to apply 2x daily for four weeks, then one application every three days. Last night was my first application and it burned like hell. I did not really sleep.  This morning I woke up and my symptoms were more mild. Then, I applied the clobetasol, and once again I am getting itching and burning that wont go away. She told me I can experience discomfort from it and to give it a few days. Has anyone had this sort of experience when first starting clobetasol? I am at wits end now, as I have not had any relief from my burning and itching for two months now. \n\nSome days it has been so bad that I am hunched in fetal position in my bed. It has started to interfere with my job (I work with people with disabilities, which is an emotionally demanding job) and I have had a lot of break downs on a daily basis. Luckily I do see a therapist who is wonderful, and we are working on managing my anxiety surrounding this. To top it off, I have not had sex for two months now, and I have a long term partner who I very much enjoy having sex with. I usually have a very high sex drive, so this is taking a huge emotional toll on me, making me think I will never have \"normal\" sex again. He has been so so wonderful throughout it all and is doing all he can to assure me that he just wants me to feel better and that sex can wait.\n\nSorry for this being all over the place, I guess this post was part question, part just venting.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1729, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Clobetasol burning/ scared of potential new diagnosis", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/qct759/clobetasol_burning_scared_of_potential_new/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "traumnovelle1926", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_12wi56z8", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1634806332, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/qcnh0y/is_fusion_caused_by_sticking_of_the_skin_due_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qcnh0y", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#94e044", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "e3274c30-ea6e-11eb-84cd-0edc3db2e3fd", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/qcnh0y/is_fusion_caused_by_sticking_of_the_skin_due_to/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1634806343, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1727, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is fusion caused by sticking of the skin due to excessive scratching?

But my phimosis got better to the point where I can fully retract the foreskin when flaccid and right before the beginning of the corona when erect. Therefore I stopped worrying.\n\nI left things as they are, and now, almost a month ago I started feeling an itch around the phimotic ring, and that itch wasn't going away. So I booked an appointment, and the urologist told me that I have very early signs of lichen sclerosus. I think it started because the endless scar/heal process. The doctor suggested circumcision but I told him that I prefer not to. He didn't argue and said that my foreskin looks fine/okay at the moment.\n\nHowever, reading about the condition (lichen sclerosus), I feel that it's better to remove that damaged foreskin for good and finally get circumcised after all those years. I honestly only kept it for the hopes that it might heal one day.\n\nAny advice?

I have been fortunate to the extent that the disease was identified very early and I have responded well to topical steroids and the disease is now in remission.\n\nNonetheless the disease has left me with mild phimosis which is causing me some issues. The phimosis itself is due to a very tightly defined scarred area, almost like a piece of wire or narrow finger ring, at the tip of the foreskin. The rest of the foreskin is entirely normal.\n\nI am advised by my dermatologist, who is very well regarded and published, that stretching of this scar tissue is unlikely to yield positive results and may make the situation worse.\n\nI find circumcision deeply challenging on aesthetic grounds, functional grounds - I am a mature gay man in the UK who has also lived for a considerable period of time in the US - and my strong views on infant circumcision. The surgery itself, discomfort, pain etc is not a driver of my position. Accordingly whilst I recognise that circumcision is the traditional remedy for penile LS and would also address the phimosis, I do not wish to pursue this option unless absolutely necessary, ie. unworkable phimosis or penile cancer.\n\nSo, I was wondering if any of your had either successfully resolved phimosis of this type by stretching or had undertaken surgery such as preputioplasty - a good urologist aware of my LS background has confirmed that this is possible - or limited dorsal split or surgery to remove the phimotic ring only, which fell short of circumcision, essentially leaving the foreskin intact but minimally foreshortened?\n\nI would also be interested if any of your contemplated non-circumcision surgery but were advised against due to the tendency of LS to reactivate at wound sites.\n\nAny comments and details of your own experiences would be much appreciated.\n\nMany thanks, Nick", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1683, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Solutions for Mild Phimosis arising from LS", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/q551je/solutions_for_mild_phimosis_arising_from_ls/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Throw_away_info_me", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_e8gvwehz", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1633836066, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/q50400/doctors_knowledgeable_about_ls/", "gildings": {}, "id": "q50400", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#24a0ed", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "f08d4cc6-ea6e-11eb-bdf5-0e13c8186b4f", "link_flair_text": "Doctor Recommendation", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/q50400/doctors_knowledgeable_about_ls/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1633836077, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1682, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Doctors knowledgeable about LS?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/q50400/doctors_knowledgeable_about_ls/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Anon-Y-mous1313", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5xcogxtp", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1633788483, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/q4m1yb/help_clobetasol_on_broken_skin/", "gildings": {}, "id": "q4m1yb", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#94e044", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "e3274c30-ea6e-11eb-84cd-0edc3db2e3fd", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/q4m1yb/help_clobetasol_on_broken_skin/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1633788494, "score": 1, "selftext": "I had my first real flare up and ended up with a fissure/broken skin on my vulva.

The doctor said she didn\u2019t need a biopsy because the fusing of my Labia and other symptoms made an obvious diagnosis. So she started me on Clobetasol and I have been taking it on sporadic as needed basis ever since. Back then it was thought that LS caused thinning of the skin so I only used it when I needed it. Fast forward to now, I am learning that LS causes thickening of the skin so it\u2019s ok to use Clobetasol more liberally and actually it would be wise for prevention. I am noticing a change again in my labia that I haven\u2019t noticed changing since my twenties\u2026I had my new gyno (I moved so I needed a new one) check it out but she couldn\u2019t see anything, but I know it\u2019s changing, I can feel it. \n\nSo time to rethink my Clobetasol treatment plan in terms of frequency and location of application. My new gyno says apply it all over once per week for maintenance. But I\u2019ve heard from an expert source (Dr Goldstein) to soak in warm water for 15 minutes to soften the skin for better absorption and then apply Clobetasol (size of a pea) massaging in for 90seconds - do this twice a week. What he doesn\u2019t indicate is do I apply it everywhere? Including the anus? Or just the affected parts. What is your Clobetasol treatment maintenance plans (frequency, amount &amp; location)? I\u2019d love to hear from as many people as possible as there seems to be a lot of discrepancies around this. \n\nAlso I\u2019m thinking I might need to do this routine daily for 4 weeks if I am noticing new structural changes and then every other day for 4 weeks prior to getting back to maintenance. But this is not my doctor recommending because she didn\u2019t find any new changes, so I\u2019m feeling unsure of what to do and would appreciate any advice.\n\nLastly, I heard again from Dr Goldstein that getting a biopsy after being on steroids would be useless because once you take clobetasol it changes your skin so unlikely it would show anything. Feeling a bit frustrated wishing that my younger self thought to ask for a biopsy first but alas that is not the case. I\u2019m fairly certain the LS diagnosis was correct and was confirmed by 3 gyno\u2019s but I would love to be 100% sure if I\u2019m to take steroid ointment the rest of my life. Has anyone had a biopsy after using clobetasol?

Doctor asked me a lot of questions, told me theres no reason for my kyleena to cause clitoral pain (but probably was causing the abdominal pain), which im still uncertain about.\n\nShe said LS can be genetic, or can start because of trauma to the area. \n\nnsfw-ish)) I remembered that back in october 2019, a round of rough oral sex with my bf left my clit looking kind of messed up. I remember no pain during the act, but afterwards i was swollen, in deep pain, and the skin was kind of splotchy here and there, very red and inflammed. Thinking it was just an injury that would heal eventually, I put extra care into rinsing it, cleaning it, letting it air out. I couldnt wear anything with a seam running down the middle (anything that was even remotely bodycon) for a month.\n\nI felt like my clitoris never really went back to normal since then. I remember stating it audibly a few times, yet back then it was just a little more sensitive once it healed, that's all. At the time, I was on nexplanon BC. Last year june I switched to Kyleena, and its much better than nexplanon, but it brings occasional pain, especially on the ride side of my vulva, vagina, and lower abdomen. The clitoral pain is also on the right side. \n\nSometimes the pain would start in my right abdomen and then shoot straight to the side of my clitoris. I never had this happen before kyleena.

I\u2019ve been reading up on this sub for quite some time now, and it\u2019s finally time for me to join in.\n\nI have been dealing with perineal tears EVERY time I have sex for the last 13 months now, itching all around my vulva, redness and inflammation, and white patches that come and go. My symptoms began last August after a sexual injury that caused a deep 1-inch perineal tear. I went to a gynecologist in March and expressed concern that I could be suffering from lichen sclerosus, and she told me that I was \u201ctoo young,\u201d but prescribed me clob to treat \u201cwhatever was going on.\u201d\n\nFast forward to last month. I stopped using the clob back in July because the only symptom I was still having was the tearing from sex, and I didn\u2019t want to worsen things by continually using clob since I didn\u2019t even have any sort of diagnosis. Then I had sex on back to back days in August and ended up with a tear nearly as bad as the initial one that started this all.\n\nWent to a new gynecologist. She tested my discharge and prescribed antibiotics for a bacterial infection. I went in today and she was not happy to hear that my issues have persisted (and, in fact, have worsened due to a suspected contact dermatitis rash from using Neosporin). She did a double biopsy (anus and perineum) and promised me that we\u2019ll get to the bottom of things. She said that she feels that it very well could be lichen sclerosus. (Side note - I\u2019m worried that my contact dermatitis rash may cause the biopsy results to be faulty).\n\nSo now I am in PAIN (not looking forward to next time I have to use the bathroom\u2026), and I am just so mentally exhausted. I am terrified to get a chronic diagnosis when I am only 24 years old. I feel like I\u2019ll never be able to have a fulfilling sex/love life. I would appreciate any positive vibes that y\u2019all want to send my way.\n\n\nAlso - as others have said, the numbing was the worst part of the biopsy. My biopsy itself hurt quite a bit, but the doctor said that she thinks stopped the lidocaine a little too early since it was hurting me so bad.

What is this, and why is it SO bad?? Does it mean this mad rash and itching is just going to stay forever? What's the deal??\n\n\n\nStory: A while back, I had a little red sore/ blister come up on the bottom of my vulva, close to my vagina, and I thought it was the result of recklessly wiping too hard in that area (it could be, I'm still unsure). \n\nThen when that cleared up after a few days (it was a little painful to sit down and walk because it would get irritated), another blister (?) came up, this time much closer to my vagina. This one was flesh coloured and looked like a bump of skin, while the other was red and looked a little more like a sore. This lasted a day, and again, was easily irritated, so I'd have to be really gentle when walking around. For both, I was basically waddling around like a penguin, and taking slow steps up stairs. This one took one day to chill out. \n\nTHEN, yesterday, when that cleared up, I had mad itching on my clitoral hood and the area there after I had a shower. I thought damn, was I just a little too careless with the shower gel (I always attempt to get it to stop from falling near my genitals, which is obviously, near impossible - and yes, it is scented). It itched all day yesterday and today, and I noticed what looked like a rash developing in the area around my clitoral hood - don't think that's ever happened to me before, it was scary. So this morning I thought, I'll take a shower and attempt to clean up the area with just water so I shot the area with some moderately hot water - I hoped that would help clean away any debris. Then, after coming out, I noticed some white bits on my labia, near my clitoral hood, and on the top too. I was confused, I thought it was yeast, and I thought whyyyy, because I just cleaned up. Took a closer look and waa surprised to find that the 'yeast' did not rub away. I was very surprised and confused. Then I search it up, and every answer points to Lichen Sclerosus. Is that what this is? It's scary when so many people are saying \"I was scared it was Lichen Sclerosus\", why the fear? What's the deal?

In this three-part series, I interview my husband about his perspective and what's it's like to be married to someone with LS and the types of hurdles we faced because of it. I share a lot about my journey from painful sex to pain free sex on my blog (main topics are mental health and LS, body dysmorphia and LS, and sex and sexual health and LS), but I thought it was important to highlight the perspective of our partners.

I went to my gynecologist, and she told me I probably had psoriasis, which I then treated for a few weeks with clobetasol. When I stopped the treatment, the symptoms came back, so I resumed treatment and in May 2021 I went back and had a biopsy in case of LS. The biopsy result came back as a yeast infection plus psoriasis. My gyno treated the yeast infection and had me continue with the clobetasol. She also referred me to a specialist to help find the best treatment option. I stopped using clobetasol for a month prior to the appointment with the specialist (as advised by my doctor). I had another biopsy and the results came back as LS. This was two days ago, and I\u2019m feeling very overwhelmed by the diagnosis and confused as to why the first biopsy came back as psoriasis. \n\nPrior to the first biopsy, I had known LS was a possibility, and I had actually come to terms with that outcome. But then with the psoriasis diagnosis, I stopped worrying. Now I have to come to terms with the LS diagnosis again, and it\u2019s been more difficult. It\u2019s been a roller coaster of emotions. I\u2019m still in pain from the biopsy and LS, I\u2019m confused, and I\u2019m upset by the diagnosis but also relieved to know what\u2019s going on. \n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience with an incorrect diagnosis?

I suspect that I have LS since im 14 or 15 years old as my foreskin at that time began to become white and scarred. The LS on my foreskin never really caused any medical problems like phimosis or itching and I could pull it back easily. It was mainly a cosmetic issue. The LS luckily (I unfortunately can not explain why) started to peel at some point which left my foreskin looking pretty normal again. However since last year the LS started to be present on my glans especially around the meatus which got me really scared and depressed. Because of Covid-19 and my education I could not get a diagnosis last year and had to wait till this year. My dermatologist described me 0,1% Betamethasone and I applied it once a day for two weeks straight. To be honest it helped a little bit considering the scarring and discoloration but my glans does not really look pink and \"healthy\". In my next visit I probably ask y dermatologist if we can change the therapy.  Since the diagnosis and being told that there is no cure for this disease I have been constantly researching. During my research I have found a few interesting things which i wanted to ask you guys since many of you probably suffer longer than I do.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. circumcision  \n I have read in tons of articles and scientific papers that circumcision is somewhat curative. As far my understanding goes: circumcision prevents moisture and \"trapped\" urine which leads the glans to be \tdry. Circumcision however is only curative if its done in the early \tstages of LS and if only the foreskin is affected. My question is: Is there somebody who has done circumcision after his glans was already affected? And if you did it, has it helped long term?  \n \n2. cortisone  \n In my research I saw a articel which described the long term use of cortisone on the glans. \tIn that articel a male LS sufferer used cortisone (I think it was also Betamethasone) every day for 25 years. The result was pretty good considering he had no symptons like scar tissue or \tdiscoloration. I think the articel also states that the skin tissue on the glans \"deals\" better with the cortisone than other \tskin tissue. My question: Are there any males who used corstisone \tover a longer timeline and if yes, could you also share your \texperience?  \n \n3. laser therapy   \nLaser therapy is, I think, mainly used on female patients. The offers in my country are pretty much all targeted toward women and i did not found one single doctor who performs these laser therapies on men which in my opinion sucks because according to one study those therapies are really effective and also somewaht \"curative\". My question: Did any of you \tguys have done it? What was your experience and has it helped long term?  \t  \n \n\nI know that this is a lot of text and questions but since I do not know anybody from my friends/family who suffers from LS, I just wanted to ask you guys and I think this also works kind of as therapy lol.

There\u2019s a ton of research articles, alternative medicine discussions, sex Ed, information for diets that can help, etc., and a very large general \u201cyou\u2019re never alone in this disease\u201d feeling. I know this group is similar but I\u2019m constantly looking at both for help so I wanted to put it out there for anyone looking for more in-depth info at a glance!

To make a long story short, it turns out that my clitoris is completely fused underneath scar tissue. \n\nI have been using clob ointment for a long time, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be doing much in the way of uncovering my clit. I had a surgery in May 2019, but within a week the tissue had grown back. \n\nOn the bright side, I recently started seeing a new doctor who I have a lot of faith in, and I might end up getting plastic surgery if my insurance covers it (this was her own suggestion). \n\nBut I\u2019m wondering if anyone else here has dealt with lack of clitoral stimulation. The only way I can even begin to feel pleasure is with excessive, hard grinding (with sheets on my own, or with my ex, who was my only ever partner, on his stomach. He didn\u2019t like that, because apparently it got old really quickly. But he also didn\u2019t like the fact that I have vaginismus as well, so I was just a useless impenetrable object that he couldn\u2019t even turn on with oral sex.)\n\nI still have never had an orgasm. I don\u2019t think I have to explain how that makes me feel. \n\nHas anyone had any success with overcoming this specific issue? What are some surgeries you\u2019ve had? Did they work?

I'm 22 yo female with diabetes type 1. I wasnt diagnosed, but my gynecologist thinks I have diabetic vulvovaginitis or yeast infection. Second one is really doubtful because 2 gynecologists said that they dont see it and tests showed the same. So my fear is that I have LS. My endocrinologist said that it could be either LS, oncology (which I dont have because I got my tests for it too) or allergic dermatitis (I'm very sensitive and have been like this ever since I was a child) So i have burning sensation and like pulsation for 2 months now, but no itching. It gets worse when it is hot down there, also I'm kinda dry. I have redness under my clit and all over labia minora too. Also after like month and 3 weeks I got some kind of not very smooth skin that looks like I've been scratching on it but I didn't. Plus like blisters or bumps of skin which is pink as well and feels like burning when I'm touching it (its located near vaginal opening) But the thing is I kinda had the barely pink color skin on my vaginal opening for 2-4 days and it just disappeared when I started to moisturize my vulva. Plus I have started advantan ointment 4 days ago. It got better but this ointment was prescribed to me to help with inflammation. Anything you can say on my case will be appreciated!

So I made an appointment with the derm, but it's not until late January anyway.\n\nI'm worried the derm won't know anything about LS, which makes me nervous for two reasons- 1) I read that a biopsy isn't needed if the doctor has enough experience to diagnose it from appearance, and I *really* don't want a biopsy and 2) I have a relative with LS who has gotten ineffective treatment and lots of inconclusive biopsies over the years. And I have lots of other personal and family history of people getting the wrong treatment for years for other conditions because their doctor was not a specialist and didn't know what they were doing.\n\nThe thing is, I have no idea how to find a doctor near me who actually knows anything about LS.

It all started with a yeast infection when I was 19 that persisted for 6 months straight. I went to several gynecologists who prescribed fluconazole and sent me away. I was so depressed and desperate that I cut out all sugar and carbohydrates for 2 months, but even that didn\u2019t help. A blood test concluded that I am *not* diabetic, so I became convinced that my birth control pills were the problem and switched to an IUD (kyleena), which I have had for 2 years now.\n\nAfter that, my infections finally eased up, but sex became excruciatingly painful, like someone is pouring acid into my vagina. I tear every time, no matter much foreplay, how much lube, how turned on I am, etc. Even the slightest touch results in tiny rips that feel like little paper cuts. It seems like my labia have lost all elasticity because they keep getting longer, which is uncomfortable and makes me really self-conscious. I have considered labiaplasty to fix it.\n\nA month ago, my yeast infection returned, and I  have been so itchy and sore both inside and on my vulva that I can\u2019t walk or sit comfortably. Medication isn\u2019t helping, as usual. The itch is unbearable and I can\u2019t help scratching at it. This of course results in swelling and more cuts. \n\nThis shit really gets me down. Not only is it extremely painful and uncomfortable just living my day-to-day life, but I also have a very high libido and it\u2019s *so* frustrating and saddening that I can\u2019t enjoy sex anymore. I feel like I\u2019m broken.\n\nI did a little digging online and came across lichen sclerosus, and now all of a sudden everything makes sense. Yesterday I called a dermatologist and I have an appointment in a few weeks. It\u2019s a bit disheartening that there isn\u2019t a cure, but with treatment it can\u2019t get much worse than this...right? I\u2019m scared, but for once I have a little bit of hope. \n\nThanks for reading my story.

The diagnose was based on the symptoms and the effect of the treatment - so no biopsy. \n\nI was also diagnosed with overactive bladder by specialists in 2016. Mostly because of the itch, pain and pee urge in my bladder.\n\nI was also diagnosed with herpes genitalis shortly after I started treatment for LS, because the treatmet triggered it. And it was very extreme... The first outbreak lasted for over a month, and the following outbreaks had only 14 days beetween each outbreak... So for 2-3 years I have been very plaqued by herpes, but this year I only had a couple of small herpes outbreaks and no longer need medical treatment for it. \n\nFor 1 1/2 year I wasn't able to have sexual intercourse with my partner because of the pain, but after a good proces with excercises from a fysio, I slowly became able to be with my partner again. \n\nI still often experience itch and pain in vulva, vagina, bladder, etc. The pain/itch 'under the skin' was/is the worst.\n\nI have continuously been wondering why I had these symptoms when it was a skin-disease. \n\nFriday I was finally examined by a very competent Vulva-specialist, and she concluded that I suffer from Vulvodynia... so that pretty much explains why the treatment for LS didn't work very well and also explaims the pain/itch 'under the skin'.\n\nI have been mistreatet for LS in over 4 years... the vulva specialist didn't even have to take a biopshy to conclude that I suffer from Vulvodynia and not LS. When I was teenager I also thought that I suffered from Vulvodynia, but no doctor would confirm that... So I was right, after all... \nIf i wasn't mistreated for LS I probably would have been without all the trouble with herpes.. and the medication for herpes and overactive bladder... etc...\n\nI will complain about the misdiagnosis...\n\nSo.. if you have just a little doubt about your LS diagnosis I hope you will manage to seek other specialist a lot faster than I did.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 937, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just wanted to share my story...", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/jzkoh4/just_wanted_to_share_my_story/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DunderVI", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8x9tlu2h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606070174, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/jz0rdi/tears_clob_or_ls/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jz0rdi", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/jz0rdi/tears_clob_or_ls/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1606070184, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nDoes anyone have advise on telling the difference between tears from LS vs tears because of Clob thinning your skin? \n\nI have always gotten tears since my LS flared, but I am getting tears with very little pressure now when my skin feels pretty much fine.

I got diagnosed for several mycosis, bacteria and even herpes. My skin is burning, breaks during sex and itches like hell. The last doctor I saw told me about LS. She made a Pap test to see if there were any Bacteria. She found \u201cStaphlyokokken +++\u201d and gave me a new cream. It didn\u2019t help. She told me because of the Staphylokokken, that LS was excluded. I finally have a doctors appointment in special clinic.

Because of how sensitive the area is, my gyno told me she was going to give me more local anesthetic than usual. \n\n\nShe doused me in antiseptic and injected me three times. The first two times sucked, because she was basically injecting it what felt like right into my clitoris. It was a sharp take-your-breath-away kind of pain. My legs tensed and I let out a few ugly noises but it didn't last long. I'd probably rather do this than a colposcopy biopsy again. \n\n\nAfter that I couldn't feel a thing, I didn't even know she had done the biopsy until she showed me. She used a very small punch on me (2mm) because of how small and sensitive the area is. \nI bled a little bit but she applied pressure for a few minutes and the bleeding stopped, then applied some silver nitrate. \nMy entire vulva was numb for about 2 hours. \n\n\nIt's worn off now and the area stings a bit and just feels tender and hot. I am in discomfort, but I'm fine. The needles sucked the most, I think maybe moreso in my experience because of how close it was to my clitoris.\n\n\nThe best advice I can give is to find a good doctor, whether it's your derm or gyno. My gyno is absolutely lovely and explained the entire process and she was incredibly kind and understand when I didn't want to go ahead with it a few weeks ago. \nHaving a good doctor makes the experience alright!\n\nAlso, get yourself some period undies and wear them to your appointment! They're so much more comfy than pads.\n\nETA: Tips - Get yourself some urine alkalizer and peri bottles. I also wasn't prepared for swelling afterwards, gyno says it's all good.\n\nGood luck, you got this!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1086, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just wanted to share my biopsy experience [f]", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/laqsaa/just_wanted_to_share_my_biopsy_experience_f/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Pc-Wizzard", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_452x4qii", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1612220280, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/lagtdw/can_lichen_go_into_remission/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lagtdw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/lagtdw/can_lichen_go_into_remission/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1612487598, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a biopsy tomorow and i fear my symptoms wont show as before 3 days ago i had a white ring around my foreskin it was lichen hard wierd 8,G,A shaped spots like dry paper and today i noticed they are still present but not as bulky they spikeup at somedays they are super white 0.2mm and sometimes they look like dry skin.

It all started in June last year when I had what I thought was thrush. I'd been on antibiotics for acne, and began having intense itching, and although I didn't have any discharge, I spoke to my local pharmacist and she was confident that it was thrush based on my antibiotic use, so gave me a canesten pessary  and a 2% Clotrimazole cream for external use. This helped a lot, and I assumed that the treatment had worked.\n\nHowever, over the last few months the itching has returned. After some research, I'm now questioning if I have lichen sclerosus. I have the intense itching (both vaginal and anal, as the itch seems to have spread), and I also have a very defined white patch, which forms a figure of 8 around my anus and vagina, although at this point the white patch seems to have only just spread to the vagina and is more dominant around the anus, which also has small papercut like splits in the skin. I also have hypothyroidism, which I know can be linked to autoimmune conditions such as LS.\n\nSo, I rang my doctors, who are currently operating a phone call only service due to the covid situation in the UK. They gave me a phone consultation with my GP, and I explained the situation. Her opinion is that I'm too young for LS as I'm only 27, and it's more likely to be thrush that hasn't cleared up. I explained that the white patches seem to match exactly with the descriptions of LS, and she said that it's likely to be thrush causing the white patches, which is something I've never heard of thrush causing. I was very forceful in requesting that she see me for a physical exam and ideally a biopsy, but she said there's absolutely no need to see me, there's no doubt in her mind that it's thrush, especially as the 2% Clotrimazole cream eased the itching, which she said wouldn't have happened if it was LS (it soothes the area when applied, but doesn't stop it returning if that makes sense).\n\nNow, my GP is normally fantastic for me, as she initially worked as a dermatologist for several years before switching to being a GP. As such, I assumed she would be really helpful with this issue, as I know a lot of people get referred to derms. And she did say herself that she is experienced in treating people with LS. But she is just so certain that this is not what I've got, and as such is refusing to see me, saying instead that she will prescribe me an oral medication, fluconazole, which she said should clear everything up. Now, I get that she's the expert, and I'm happy to try this, but she basically said that even if it doesn't help, the most she'll do is give me a repeat prescription for the 2% Clotrimazole cream, and she won't see me in person as there's no need. I requested a callback from another GP, and they said that as my original doctor is the dermatology expert they would follow her lead and only treat me as someone with ongoing thrush, and they would not be willing to examine me in person.\n\nMy concern is that if I'm right and it is LS, the longer it goes untreated, the harder it will be to get under control. The widespread nature of the white patches and the intensity of the itching lead me to think that it is already quite severe. So my options now are either save up to go private, which is going to take a long time in terms of both finances and the covid situation, or treat myself through getting a prescription online for either dermovate or betnovate. I would do this through a registered pharmacist, it wouldn't be from anywhere dodgy.\n\nEssentially, I'm asking for advice. Does anyone know if the white patches I'm describing could be due to thrush? Obviously I would follow the treatment prescribed by my GP first to see if I could be mistaken in thinking it's LS. But if the treatment fails and she still refuses to see me, would it be possible to self-treat with dermovate or betnovate? Has anyone else done this?\n\nThank you in advance, and sorry for the long post!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1085, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What to do if your GP won't examine you?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/l9z6we/what_to_do_if_your_gp_wont_examine_you/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Buggsy0", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_56ji0pow", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1612160304, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/l9wlyd/help_please/", "gildings": {}, "id": "l9wlyd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 30, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/l9wlyd/help_please/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1612439143, "score": 4, "selftext": "I had a biopsy done back in December. I had inflamed tissue just inside my vagina that my NP thought might be hymen tissue that healed funky, creating a pocket causing recurrent infections and lots of vaginal pain. I got a call from the nurse saying I had lichen mucosa and said my NP was prescribing Clobetasol to use as needed and to follow up in a month. I was super confused, but made the follow up appointment, picked up the Clob, and did a quick search on lichen mucosa... which comes up with nothing. Didn\u2019t see related at all to what I was experiencing. I was nervous to use the steroid cream because it clearly states external use only and I didn\u2019t want to put it inside my vagina. I went to my follow up appointment Friday where my NP said I have lichen sclerosus. She gave me an Premarin cream to use for a week on my labia which she said \u201clook chapped\u201d. And then to use the Clobetasol for at least two weeks after and then to continue use until I notice a relief in symptoms. She did a blood draw for Estrogen levels to see if that is worsening my symptoms and said to follow up in a month. \n\n\nAnd I\u2019m feeling really lost and confused. I guess when she said that I had this chronic thing that she would sit down and explain it, how it would effect my life, possible life style changes to look for, what worsening symptoms to look for... maybe a pamphlet or something. \n\nAfter googling lichen sclerosus and do a quick reddit search I was able to find a lot more information that has calmed some of my fears and created a whole bunch of new ones.\n\nI\u2019m confused about whether LS causes tissues to thicken or thin? Because of tears (which I believe the inflamed spot that the biopsy came from was the result of a tear) can I still use vaginal dilators? I also don\u2019t have any white patches so I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019m meant to put the Clob. My labia are clearly experiencing inflammation and dryness. But my biopsy occurred internally, which means the lichen is present in my vagina not just externally. I asked my NP about how to use the steroid but she didn\u2019t really give me a clear answer. I\u2019m also pretty sure that I\u2019ve had two tears in the anal area. They felt like paper cuts, healed after about two days. Should I be using the Clob back there? Can I still takes baths? What type of underwear should I wear? Can I go swimming? Also... the Premarin isn\u2019t providing any relief... none whatsoever. So should I be using the Clob along with it?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1084,

The last few months I\u2019ve had some painful symptoms, glass feeling skin and some swelling. I tried an over the counter yeast infection treatment to no avail. \n\nI\u2019ve had it in the back of my mind that I may have LS for a couple years, but have read about how it\u2019s hard to diagnose. Today I went to planned parenthood, my first time at this location as I recently moved. I was told that my vagina is healthy, it\u2019s all the surrounding areas that have the issue. She says that it looks like LS. After hearing all these horror stories of being misdiagnosed and doctors just not being familiar with the condition, I was shocked that she said it so quickly without me bringing it up. \n\nShe said that she first is going to treat me for a yeast infection of the skin. Then in a month I come back and from there we will see if I still have symptoms and will start a steroid cream. \n\nMy question is, if this is LS can it cause bumps? I have some small bumps near my perineum/ closer to my anus. She did not seem to concerned with them and thought they may have to do with the friction from swelling. The bumps them self do not hurt, just the swelling. \n\nMy other question is is this manageable without insurance? I just paid $200 for this visit not including the medicine, and I go back in a month. Will I have to go back often after that? Do the steroid creams work or am I going to have to have a few visits to see what works for me? \n\nI would have insurance if I could, I don\u2019t qualify for state insurance and for the dermatology I need im looking at $400-500 a month.

Visited my GP and was told to use moisturiser in addition to stretching (no progress). Was then told to use Hydrocortisone &amp; stretch (no progress). Same again with Betamethasone &amp; stretch (no progress). Found mention of Clobetasol and asked my GP who prescribed it and I got a little bit of progress but nothing close to 'normal. \n\nEventually I got referred to a urologist who took literally 5 seconds to look at it, said \"you need a circumcision\" and ushered me out of the room. I then went back to my GP who told me that they'd diagnosed lichen sclerosus and to continue using the Clobetasol and stretching and that unless I get circumcised it's never going to get better. I went back a couple of years later to say nothing had changed, I was still using this steroid cream with very little benefit (more of not getting any worse rather than improving), and my GP basically told me to continue with the cream to stop it from getting any worse.\n\nFast forward to now. About 5-6 years after starting to go to the doctors about my issue. I use Clobetasol 0.05% 4 or 5 times a week. I don't really get any itching, bleeding, cracking or tearing, but I do have some white patches and can feel a little lump of what I assume is scar tissue. Should I have had a biopsy at some stage or is a visual confirmation from a urologist enough to be sure?\n\nI'm just a bit stuck. Not sure what I can even do next. Circumcision isn't really an option I'm willing to consider unless it gets drastically worse, I'm already on the only treatment the NHS recognises, and I still have phimosis.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? any other ideas or advice? \n\nthanks very much in advance. i have another Dr\u2019s appointment by phone in a month (with the same guy who wasn\u2019t much help before). then it will probably be a long wait for a dermatologist, which is probably what should have happened before instead of a urologist. extremely frustrating trying to get this diagnosed and treated. if it was an STD there\u2019s free walk in clinics everywhere constantly, doctors seem to not know much about this issue and also dismissive and nonchalant about it. \n\nthanks for reading if anyone has any advice or similar experience let me know!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1397, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "(24M) Does this sound familiar to anyone?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/o2ml54/24m_does_this_sound_familiar_to_anyone/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Normal_Historian_536", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5zi04air", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1624000237, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/o2j55f/support_for_younger_people/", "gildings": {}, "id": "o2j55f", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/o2j55f/support_for_younger_people/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1624012054, "score": 0, "selftext": "Hi, I'm literally brand new to reddit and this subreddit, but I wasn't sure where else to go.   \n\n\nI just turned 20, but I've been diagnosed and getting treatment for LS since I was about 9.

I've been struggling with LS symptoms on my glans for almost a year now. I am uncircumcised, and also have a bit of \"extra\" foreskin. I have a history of numerous skin irritations on my penis since I was a teenager, and to get worse, the bad habit of unconsciously touching the region when anxious - and alone ofc (not anymore since the major problems started). So I was very used to have red patches/ irritations here and there, and never worried too much about them. However, a year ago I started getting different spots, not itchy/sensible, that weren't going off. One of them became really white and \"thick\", and then I went to an urologist. We did a series of exams and found nothing, and he told me that the problem could be lichen sclerosis. He prescribed Betametasone ointment, and I applied it for 4 weeks once a day. The results were very good, after 2-3 days the white spot was thinner and was almost gone (although I had noticeable depigmentation side effect of the corticoid). I finished the 4 weeks treatment despite having sensitivity issues/other new red patches/irritations which I suspect were due to the ointment side effect of making the skin very sensitive. I was glad the issue was gone, but few weeks later (about 4), glans irritations came back, but in different spots. It seems I can't touch my penis/have sex anymore without having problems (although I did it without lubrification - I just realized I prolly can't do that ever again in my life - will always need a lubrificant, which is not a big issue anyways). Aside from the glans, out of nowhere I got some bumps on my scrotum skin. I was using a body cream on my legs at that time, and I strongly suspect it was the trigger for these testicle patches, since I didn't have them before. I also suspect the Corona vaccine (Pfizer) messing with my immune system, but I already had the glans lichen before taking it, so I'm not sure (only the scrotum lichen appeared after it). Anyway, few days after, these \"hives\" on my scrotum started to itch a bit, and some of them have a white patch right on the center. I know it is likely lichen again, and went straight to a dermatologist this time. I had a very traumatic biopsy collection of glans tissue (they didn't speak good English), and here I am waiting for the results.  \n\nI am almost sure it is LS, and I'm a bit afraid of also having some kind of dysplasia/malignancy on the skin. I read on the internet that LS increases the chance of skin cancer. The collection was made on one specific white area, but I have a lot of other red patches on glans/inner side of foreskin ATM - I hope none of them have these major problems apart from LS. I am very anxious to apply my Betametasone cream again, but I guess I need to wait for the healing  of biopsy spot (the doctor gave me very little information on how to proceed now, just told me to go back there in 2 weeks to see results/discuss).\n\nI just wanted to share my experience in order to feel a bit better. Also, I found weird that I had patches on scrotum as well (and seems that everyone had them only on the penis). Anyone already had LS in other parts of the body?  \nAnother question: anyone had non itchy patches? Mine are not itchy at all (apart from scrotum, but very very slightly). \nThank you for the attention!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1387, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "29M - Almost Diagnosed", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/nzwimk/29m_almost_diagnosed/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Opening-Deer-6168", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_awkv3nzw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1623626732, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/nz8x4g/missing_spontaneous_sex/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nz8x4g", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/nz8x4g/missing_spontaneous_sex/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1623660777, "score": 4, "selftext": "Does anyone else miss being able to have sex spontaneously before LS :/ now every time I either have to know in advance so I don\u2019t put on ointment etc or go rinse it off before penetration and get aroused again so it doesn\u2019t end up in places it\u2019s not supposed to be \n\nMost of the time this doesn\u2019t bother me that badly but it really did tonight.

This thread will be about my journey with the Fem Touch laser treatment for LS. Other brand names are Mona Lisa Touch or Tulip. A new dermatologist recommended Fem Touch for me after steroid ointment was not stopping my flares and I wanted a more longterm solution. There is new research showing how lasers designed for vaginal rejuvenation for post-menopausal women have great success in treating LS. It's considered a cosmetic procedure so it's not covered by insurance. It's expensive, around \\~$1000 per dose, and you need 3 doses. \n\nThe appointment was easy to set up. The laser technician asked that I shave completely before our appointment. A physician's associate examined me for any genital warts and I underwent a pap smear a few weeks earlier (I believe you cannot have this treatment if you have an STD). The experience itself incredibly painful. I yelped and gasped many times. I am 4 days out from the procedure and the recovery was very painful as well. I bled sporadically over the next few days. I'll list some helpful recovery tips below.\n\nAt this point, I have no recommendations as to whether you should do it or not, but this procedure is not for the weak of heart. If you are scared of this pain, I would recommend steroid shots, which were quick and just a short sharp pinch in the affected area (like any shot you might get). I plan on continuing the laser treatment in six weeks.\n\nTips for recovery:\n\nAquaphor or vaseline often\n\nWet wipes or a bidet for wiping\n\nPerinatal cold packs - tons on amazon. I recommend the re-usable ones so you can just toss them in the freezer and wash their covers.\n\nTake it easy!!! The doctor will tell you no exercise or sexual activity and she is NOT joking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone had a different experience or would like to share their tips, please comment below!",

There\u2019s no way to way to reverse this disease. I know exactly where some of you are. Depressed, hopeless, alone. I was there. I hated my life. I\u2019ve had lichen sclerosis for almost 2 years now. At first it wasn\u2019t bad, but then all of a sudden it got worse. For 8 months straight, 24 hours a day I was in pain. uncomfortable is a huge understatement. For 8 months I had no relief. Not one second. The little tiny bit of relief I got was when I smothered clobetosol on. It barely helped tho. It got to a point where I hated my life. My penis head went from pink to almost all white. The whole damn thing. It was so bad I couldn\u2019t even jerk off, let alone be with a women. If I did it wasn\u2019t fun and my symptoms were worse for the next few days. Nothing worked, I tried every diet from vegan to no sugar to no gluten to low Oxalate diet. Nothing worked at all. Ive always been a healthy guy. I\u2019ve played sports and worked out my whole life. I\u2019m 23, it didn\u2019t make sense and I had no clue why this was happening. I\u2019ve always been a happy person and in the span of 8 months I\u2019m sad to say I genuinely hated living. Every day was a struggle from the time I got up to when I went to bed. My whole penis was turning white and I was actually concerned I might not be able to use it properly ever again or hell even lose it at that rate. I had been putting clobetosol on every day for months which ik is terrible but I didn\u2019t care I just wanted that tiny bit of relief. Finally I knew I had to stop. I got this book a few months ago and never read it and decided I had nothing to lose.( man I wish I read it earlier) however I don\u2019t think I would have incorporated it if I weren\u2019t in such a bad place. The Book is called \u201cLichen Sclerosus beating the disease\u201d by Ginny Chandoha. Since I finished the book and started \u201cthe healing protocol\u201d within it, I am a month and a half in and barely even notice my LS anymore. I was feeling real, natural relief within 2 weeks and it\u2019s been like my body is just healing itself since. I will say, it\u2019s not easy. It is a whole lifestyle change. the hardest part for me to accept was giving up all medicine( clob, tacrimulis, etc). I already know some people are ganna get mad at this and say not to tell people to go off the creams, and that there\u2019s no cure and I\u2019m not a doctor but idgaf. This shit fucking saved my life and If I can help just one person get better from what I learned no amount of money could replace that. I know what it\u2019s like to feel completely hopeless, and I don\u2019t want that for anyone. Think about this. The US makes up 5 percent of the world population but uses 65% of all prescribed medicine used in the world. All medicine prescribed and researched in the US is made to relieve SYMPTOMS, not to cure you. That\u2019s for any health problem. The medical industry is a billion dollar business. They don\u2019t want to cure you because then you have no reason to feed them more money. Doctors want best for you yes but they simply are taught to give you these pills and prescriptions. Tacromulus and clob will certainly help some people\u2019s symptoms, but your basically just putting a blanket over the real problem and turning a blind eye to underlying causes, while also maybe causing other problems down the line. To give a run down, a big part of the diet the book gave me was that, yes I had to eat \u201chealthy\u201d but EVERYTHING has to be organic. I\u2019m not ganna get into why because this is a long post and reading the book explains it all so well. Along with that it gives you suplements to take, detox teas, natural medicines that have worked wonders for me, and eliminating chemicals from your life. The idea is that America has 80,000 chemicals that are everywhere form your food to Beauty supplies, cleaning supplies and anywhere else you can think. These chemicals were introduced within the past 50 years or so( I forget exactly when) but new diseases and diseases that were very rare are rampant now. I read the book 2 months ago so I don\u2019t remember the facts very well now but the research done by the lady who wrote it is incredible. She turned over every stone. Anyways, through what I have learned in the book and applied, I barely ever notice my lichen sclerosis. That\u2019s incredible to me. I have my life back. I can go to the gym and not be in pain, put clothes on normal without a second thought instead of gingerly and dreadfully. The lifestyle is most certainly inconvenient and a good chunk of money, but I\u2019m in my body 100% of my life, no fucking break from that. I\u2019ll spend the extra money without the bat of an eye to be healthy, especially when it comes to my lil soldier. No amount of money would make me go back to where I was. I can\u2019t even describe how happy I was when I started to realize this was working. No creams that were ruining my penis skin or suprressing my immune system, just natural healing. She talks about this in the book, but I also had other small health problems go away that I thought were just part of life. This includes stomach pains, I was getting sharp cologne pains, a rash on my thigh disappeared. I also had just gotten diagnosed with vericoles veins which is when your vein in your testicles enlarges. It made my testicles swollen and hurt often and the doctor said could affect me from having kids. He said there is no cure for this except surgery which doesn\u2019t always even work. I shit you fucking not that is gone now. I\u2019ve only been doing this for a month and a half 2 months. 2 months ago I was in constant pain, was told I might not have kids, my penis and balls in terrible shape, now I\u2019m healing. I think some pink is returning to my skin too, but honestly I\u2019m just happy to not be in pain. I still cheat and get hammered here and there and that usually leads to drunk demolishing of any of the old good foods, but it\u2019s hard to be perfect. I notice a slight back track but then I\u2019m right back on it and healing again. I went to Florida for a few days for work and couldn\u2019t eat organic and had drinks and I noticed it got slightly worse for the few days following as well. Sucks but just shows I have to stick with it or it\u2019s right back to where I was. Again, I\u2019m also only a 1.5 months in so I might be able to get away with more when I\u2019m more fully recovered. I\u2019m no where near fully recovered but on a great path. As I stated before the book has a year long healing protocol. It\u2019s also a little hard sometimes dealing with it in social situations and even family members who don\u2019t know why I eat organic. They just think I\u2019m a weird health nut but You can\u2019t care what others think. I know a lot of you have spouses and it will be a lifestyle change for them too with cleaning supplies and detergent changes as well. If they love you they will support you. Tbh I\u2019m terrified to ever get a gf and have to explain why tf I have to do all this but that\u2019s life man fuck it. Don\u2019t care what others think go for what you want and do what you have to do to live YOUR life healthy and happy. There\u2019s a lot more things from the book that I haven\u2019t explained but I\u2019ve said the main parts. Please ask me if you have questions or concerns about this but I hope you guys try it and if you do let me know!!!It\u2019s changed my life. Good luck to all of you, things get better I promise. I\u2019m here to help.\n\nbook- lichen sclerosis beating the disease by Ginny Chandoha", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1375, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How I am completely reversing my Lichen sclerosis naturally", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ny0mha/how_i_am_completely_reversing_my_lichen_sclerosis/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Snapped_Soul", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_au5p1bjg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1623480309, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ny0kjv/question_about_steroid_creams/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ny0kjv", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/ny0kjv/question_about_steroid_creams/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1623480321, "score": 1, "selftext": "M(21) uncircumcised\n\nSo I have not been officially diagnosed with LS and my dermatologist seems to believe I don\u2019t have LS but I hope I can ask this here.

"So, I'm curious how many LS patients have had a biopsy to diagnose their LS and also have had that biopsy tested for Lyme disease.\n\nI've formatted this post as a survey because I am very curious about people's answers, but I would also love to discuss the topic further with other interested people here.\u00a0 I have a hard time understanding how anybody with LS might not be interested in learning more about or discussing possible root causes for LS, but people are funny :)\n\nScientific evidence supporting the link between LS and Lyme disease has been growing for decades.\u00a0 However, the Borrelia bacteria which are thought to be the cause of Lyme disease have proven to be difficult to detect in the blood or urine samples of patients when standard methods are used.\u00a0 Studies have found that tissue samples on the other hand, tend to be a more reliable source material for detecting evidence of Borrelia in the body - especialy in patients with LS.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere are some links to peer reviewed journal articles which discuss and provide evidence for the possible link between LS and Lyme disease.\u00a0 The first artice I've linked was submitted to the publisher in 1992 and the title is:\u00a0\n\n\"Further Evidence for\u00a0Borrelia burgdorferi\u00a0Infection in Morphea and Lichen Sclerosus et Atrophicus Confirmed by DNA Amplification\"\n\nNote that the first word in the title is FURTHER.\u00a0 As you can see, this was not a new idea even in 1992.\u00a0 Also, because this first article is so old, they use an outdated term for LS and refer to the disease as lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.. Just in case anybody was confused by that at first like I was.\n\nThe last thing I'd like to mention is that the final link is not realy to a peer reviewed article, but it contains references to a number of peer reviewed studies which discuss the possible link between LS and Lyme.\u00a0 I often find many of the journal articles I read by looking at the references in articles I am already reading.. It can be a helpful way to find additional relevant info on the topic you are interested in.\u00a0\n\n\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X9390020I\n\n\u00a0https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/419698\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9006371/\n\nhttps://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/11/02/link-between-lichen-sclerosus-and-borrelia-burgdorferi-infection\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nr66lm)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1341, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Have any LS patients had a biopsy that was tested for Lyme disease?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/nr66lm/have_any_ls_patients_had_a_biopsy_that_was_tested/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "haltiamreptaar", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7y75j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1622691452, "domain": "self.lichensclerosus", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/nr3yt6/discharge/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nr3yt6", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/lichensclerosus/comments/nr3yt6/discharge/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1622691463, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nSo my gyno diagnosed me with LS recently after many tests for yeast, BV, trich, and other infectious agents came back negative.

My logic tells me that if the skin is already thin, then I would not want to put something on that causes it to thin in the long run. Of course we all have to determine what is best for us as an individual. I am going to multiple practitioners in multiple disciplines in order to find my answers. Taking what I need and leaving what won\u2019t work. Without further adieu: topicals I rotate and why:\n\n1: hyaluronic acid: this stuff feels great I mean what a relief to the pain! It helps the collagen grow, so hopefully helps skin to grow back healthy\n\n2: Rick Simpson Oil dissolved in fractionated coconut oil (or any pure oil medical marijuana tincture make sure no flavors just oil and herb concentrate) This stuff is great both topically and internally. The pain killing and lubricating effect is very soothing. If you are feeling anxiety about your situation, take it internally instead of Xanax or whatever(benzos can actually cause some autoimmune flares). You will be calming your system and keeping the harmful chemicals out. \n\n3. Lavender oil. You will see this one listed on multiple websites as being helpful. The scent is calming. The oil is cooling. Great for taking down the burn. \n\n4. O3 oil: it\u2019s triple ozonated olive oil (easy to find online): long lasting moisture, protection, clean feeling. Good before you sweat it will protect. \n\nI am only a couple weeks into this leg of my autoimmune journey, so this is only the beginning of what I am going to be sharing with you.

There is a  .0000003% chance of this happening to me. \n\nI've been getting tossed around from dermatologist to dermatologist for 8 months. Started with UTI like symptoms and a friction burn from sex and I wasn't able to shower right away. On one side, there was a horizontal tear.. on the other,, the friction turned to lichen planus looking lesions. Had a biopsy done on the first lesion, came back as eczema/atopic dermatitis. Was prescribed pimecrolimus and tacrolimus. \n\nThen the white spot appeared. Its painful.. probably the diameter of a qtip handle. I told the doctor I have had eczema and it feels nothing like this, this is actual pain not itch. I get diagnosed as a hypochondriac and get told to go get a second opinion after 10 visits. \n\nFinally get in with new doctor after 3 months. Seems promising, and he says it may be lichen planus but if my original biopsy showed eczema then he agreed with that.\n\nFast forward to the follow up a month later, they have stopped taking my insurance and tell me an hour before I'm set to get my biopsy done. I pay out of pocket and am pretty much scolded by the new doctor because \"a new biopsy won't change anything, it's either lichen planus or eczema and the treatment is the same.\" And when I insisted on a biopsy for my sanity after 8 months, pretty much just insisted I was an idiot and to accept the previous diagnosis.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks, im exposed to COVID. They are out of instant tests and they give me the PCR. They tell me to log into one of those portals that has all your medical records on it. While checking for my COVID status, I saw the biopsy results from 2 WEEKS AGO. It read:\n\n\"The reaction is pauci-inflammatory and indicative of early lichen sclerosis in the appropriate clinical setting.\"\n\nThe doctor didn't even call to tell me. He sent a prescription for Desonide 0.05% cream to the pharmacy, which my insurance also didn't cover.\n\nI've been on a downward spiral from a brain injury I received in 2019 that was just getting better when this started. I cant even get a doctor to call me back. I just want to cut this one small spot out before it spreads somewhere else since I can't have a circumcision. \n\nI have no girlfriend, no wife, no kids, and quite frankly no real reason to live right now. I've spoken to 3 dermatologists and a urologist and nobody wants to help me, I just don't get it. Quite frankly, I wish my brain injury had been just a little bit harder so I wouldn't have to ride the downward spiral that came after. \n \n\nI'd be willing to bet that there's not one single birth circumcised guy that has this in this group and everything j say has fallen upon deaf ears.. the only thing keeping me from putting a bullet between my eyes is wanting to make a few more paintings before I go. But the second there's urethral involvement, or any of that shit is suggested, im out. \n\nIs there anyway to stop this from getting worse? Does it spread whenever you have sex? Does it go away and come back?

I am a guy, overweight, uncircumcised - which i have read are the two most important factors for the development of this condition. So here are my questions. \n\n1. Does this condition come on suddenly or is it something that comes from a young age?\n2. I have read that circumcision cures many cases. My itching if i remember correctly started from foreskin but now has moved to scrotum, anus, perineum and region around it. In that case, how will circumcision cure it? Also, i don't understand how itching can spread if it is an autoimmune condition. Is it something like the nerves at the foreskin become irritated which travels down to these regions and cause nerves to be irritated?\n3. For me, moisture makes things worse and cool air helps it. I don't understand how air can make nerves feel better?\n4. People say that a biopsy is definitive in this diagnosis. But if there is no infection, what exactly is the biopsy looking for? I don't have any skin discoloration, yet. So i dunno what can be seen in a microscope? \n5. If this is an autoimmune condition, it means that there is no cure to it. Why does steroids cure it? As i understand, steroids reduce inflammation. So i don't quite understand. \n\nThanks in advance for everyone who is responding.

This pain is there 6/7 days of the week with the occasional day off and occurs with touch. I have been sexually active before, with a condom and have tested negative for all std\u2019s (haven\u2019t been tested for hsv1 or 2). My last sexual encounter was in 2018. I am unsure of why all of a sudden my vagina has done this. I thought it was a hormone problem, so I removed my hormonal iud in January of 2020. The iud also gave me recurrent BV for the 2 years i had it in. The pain did not change, but the bv eventually stopped. I got my hormones check in April of this year and everything was okay except I had lower than normal DHEA Sulfate. I don\u2019t know what to do and it has been weighing on me. My vulva appears just fine, except I have very prominent fordyce spots that also appear to have pain associated with touch. My GP always says everything looks fine and I get my pap yearly.

I was diagnosed with vulvar lichen sclerosus early this year (22F), after months and months of a constant itching accompanied by a burning sensation after itching around my vulva. After being told I had a yeast infection for many months, and the antibiotics I was prescribed not working, I finally decided to visit an OBGYN instead of planned parenthood/my college health center. As soon as the OBGYN examined me, she immediately noticed white patches between my labia majora and minora (in that crevice) - she diagnosed me with LS and prescribed me with clobetasol. This steroid cream eliminated the white patch along my labia and clit, and I thought everything would be fine now, since the white patches and itchiness were gone. Fast forward months later, I realized the LS white patches are still on my clit, as it tears very easily during sex and leaves me with a burning sensation when I urinate. I actually thought I had a UTI but my PCP said the test came back negative. My question is, although the white patches on my labia have disappeared, will the white patch on my clit ever disappear? Why did the cream help my LS on my labia and not my clit? I am so scared to have any friction or rubbing occur on my clit because I know the lichen will cause the skin to tear leaving me in so much pain. Has anyone had a similar experience as mine?

X\n\nI have both genital and extra-genital LS (yay) on my hips and under my arms. My anal/vaginal LS is under control most of the time, for which I am so so grateful. However, the patches on my hips and under my arms keep growing and multiplying. Scary and depressing. No treatment has worked so far. Does anyone have any experience with this? Anything that has helped you? \n\nIm having a flare up right now (both types) and it stresses me out. I\u2019m having to wait a long time to see a Dr because of COVID. Urgh.\n\nPs: I\u2019ve had the extra-genital patches biopsied so pretty certain it actually is LS.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lichensclerosus", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bge9", "subreddit_subscribers": 1551, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Extra-genital LS", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/p359un/extragenital_ls/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}]
