I\u2019m here today because of the trauma we both experienced as a result of this medical anomaly. \n\nRecently, I have had a family member pass out the same way my ex did when she was bleeding internally, which happened as the incident this past spring. I found out about this a week after I got back from visiting my grandma in the hospital, not far from where I am currently living. My cousins and their father (my uncle) were there. Her eyes were open and she was entirely vacant, unconscious. \n\nMy ex, whom I was with at the time, was passing out. She told me to not worry about her and let her be. I was an idiot to do that and, within a few minutes, realized she was not ok. I really had never experienced such an event before. However, I needed to do something regardless of how stupid I was in my overall confusion. I almost thought she died in my arms. I had to shake her to try and get her to stay with me, making sure that she was not being hurt or falling down. I went with her in the ambulance after calling 911. I was so scared. We didn\u2019t find out until later that night that she was pregnant. They had to do emergency surgery on her and she was so scared. I just wanted to be with her but I knew I had to still work. I just wanted to provide for us because I knew she wasn\u2019t working. I finally resolved at a later time in the night, nearing the morning, that I had to call out of work for her, especially because she needed that. \n\nI was so glad that she would be alive. I stayed with her while also occasionally leaving to check on our pets. When it came time to drive her home, we got into a huge fight. I feel terrible because even though it was a small misunderstanding, I should have been much more grounded and calm in how I handled everything. I was stupid to let my emotions get the better of me in such a frazzled and exhausted state of mind. I wish I were better to her. She was my world. I could have lost her forever but I still don\u2019t have her now. \n\nEven though I am beginning therapy and reading \u201cthe four agreements\u201d, I am having a hard time buying this \u201cbeing abusive to yourself\u201d ideology. I feel like I need to be harder on myself if I want to be a better person. It doesn\u2019t matter what she did to upset me. I upset her and could have been a better partner than I was. There is so much to be said about how well someone handles a serious situation under pressure. I waivered so many times and just wanted to be her hero. Not in the white Knight way, but the way her champion should be. I\u2019m glad she is still alive, even if I don\u2019t have her. It wasn\u2019t me who saved her life. She saved mine. I will never forget that. \n\nIf someone is passing out, get them to a fucking hospital and help them NO MATTER WHAT.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ectopicpregnancy", "subreddit_id": "t5_3flb7", "subreddit_subscribers": 25, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My ex had an ectopic pregnancy.

I was confused both based on the timing of the positive and the darkness of the test line. I called my OBGYN office and they said yeah it\u2019s weird but let\u2019s check your HCG. I went the next day and it was over 1700. Weird, but I wasn\u2019t cramping, bleeding, or having any issues, so they said keep an eye out, we will see you in three weeks. \n\nCut to September 21st, I was becoming impatient for my appointment and I called and asked for another HCG test to see if my levels were rising. I took the test, got my result back and my HCG was at 8,854. Good, it\u2019s going up. While this should have eased my fears, I knew in my gut something wasn\u2019t right. Yes, it could be twins, triplets even, but I\u2019m not having any symptoms of pregnancy other than sore boobs. So I put it in the back of my mind and hoped this was just a story I\u2019d tell years later when I had two or three happy babies.\n\nSeptember 29th came, I went to the bathroom and had the tiniest specks or dark brown discharge. I wiped, no red blood, and I didn\u2019t see anymore discharge that day. I was alarmed but though, well could be my uterus stretching and old lining may be in there. I forgot about it that day and just thought maybe it was a one time thing. \n\nNext day, September 30th, I went to the bathroom and I had bright red, bloody discharge. Panic set it. I didn\u2019t have cramping and I wasn\u2019t in pain but I knew something wasn\u2019t right. I made a call to my doctor and the said to go to the ER. I made my way to the ER and explained my situation. The took urine, blood and ordered an ultrasound. When the tech came in, he did the ultrasound but it took forever. I thought to myself oh maybe he\u2019s just looking at multiple babies. He left the room and the dr came in. He used the speculum to look at my cervix, and said, will the bleeding is gone, could have been irritation, but I\u2019m gonna wait for the ultrasound report. \n\n2 hours later, I was greeted by my OBGYN. I hadn\u2019t seen him in almost 2 years and I was shocked that he was in my room. He said, \u201cWell how are you feeling?\u201d. I told him I felt fine but I had a little blood and was concerned so I came down. \n\nThat was when he delivered the heartbreaking news, \u201cIt looks like you had a pregnancy that implanted right outside your right ovary, we are going to take you in for emergency surgery before it ruptures. You may lose an ovary or tube but we gotta take you back, it\u2019s life and death if it bursts.\u201d \n\nI fell to my bed I was on crying. I had to ask for a minute. I was shocked and broken. How could this be happening. What are the chances. Why me? Will I make it through surgery? Was there a heartbeat? What can I do?\n\nAfter some comfort from the ER doctor that the didn\u2019t see a heartbeat, and a large dose of Ativan, they wheeled me into emergency surgery. When I came to after surgery he said it went well. I lost half of my right ovary, but I had plenty of eggs. I made it out alive. \n\nThis was one week ago today. I\u2019m healing physically, but the emotional healing is going to take longer. Each day is a struggle of why me but I have to have faith in God\u2019s plan. I want any other women out there struggling to know, my thoughts, prayers, and positive vibes are with you.

Any advice you can give me so I can help her through this is much appreciated and I hope none of you have to go through this again. \nThanks", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ectopicpregnancy", "subreddit_id": "t5_3flb7", "subreddit_subscribers": 197, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Wife just had her right Fallopian tube removed", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/iu7sm6/wife_just_had_her_right_fallopian_tube_removed/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "brittpeterman", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6kr5tkx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1600274246, "domain": "self.ectopicpregnancy", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/itz5pq/symptoms_after_an_ectopic_do_i_need_to_go_back_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "itz5pq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "c2580f7e-51d2-11e6-9887-0eb5d6014b07", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/itz5pq/symptoms_after_an_ectopic_do_i_need_to_go_back_to/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1600274282, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi!!! So I got diagnosed with an ectopic September fourth and it is now sept 16. So my last normal period was the beginning of last month. (I\u2019ve never kept track of my periods because they were always normal and I knew around what time I\u2019d get them) Then this month I thought I had just started my period but it was lasting two weeks which is really odd so I went to my gyno to see what was up and get on birth control. They did a PAP and asked me some other questions but then also told me I was positive for a pregnancy test. \ud83d\ude10 Mind you, the boyfriend and I are not ready for a child at all financially. Not saying we don\u2019t want kids someday because I do but just not right now. So I went home freaking the hell out and called my mom (duh!!) and the boyfriend and I talked about it too. We told his mom as well. So fast forward I had to get the methotrexate shot and all the doctors told me was no folic acid (leafy greens) and a clear liquids diet for the next few hours after I got out of the ER. I felt totally fine after the first shot and even went back to work and was completely fine. Got a call when I was at work recently and they said my HCG level is at 620 so I\u2019m going to have to go back to the ER for a second shot and the first night after the second shot I felt like shit. Abdominal pain, pain when I use the restroom, crampy upset stomach, diarrhea off and on. Sorry TMI but I\u2019m just wondering if I should go back to the ER or if anyone else has had these side affects after getting the shot. Also the doctor just told me I was good to go after I got the second shot. No directions or anything and not even on the paper work when I got released. Only thing was to follow up with my gyno in 2-3 days. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks in advance!!! \ud83d\ude42 \n\nAlso just throwing this out there, this is my first time dealing with this. I\u2019ve also been reading other posts about this topic and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one!! I am curious though if it will affect any future pregnancies when we actually are ready to have children.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ectopicpregnancy", "subreddit_id": "t5_3flb7", "subreddit_subscribers": 197, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Symptoms after an ectopic?

Last month I found out I was pregnant very early (took a test 3 days before my missed period) within a week I had spotting, and after getting my hcg levels checked a few times they were suspecting ectopic. I had a biopsy of my uterine tissue to confirm since my levels were so low they wouldn\u2019t have seen anything on an ultrasound. That same day I got the results that it was and was given a shot of MTX. Within a week my levels were negative and now my next appt is for an HSG test. \nThis whole time I have been so focused on making it through the ectopic and I feel so fortunate that it was found so early and I was able to avoid an emergency situation! But now that I am negative the grief and fear of future fertility problems is hitting me. I would love to hear or connect with women who have gone through this and hopeful who have went on to have a healthy viable pregnancy! \nIt\u2019s crazy how something you didn\u2019t even know existed before it happens to you can wind up consuming you.

None of this should have ever happened.)\nNaturally at this high of an hcg I needed a second round of MTX.\nWhat nobody told me (again, not shocking considering the quality of my care after the fact) was that MTX kills your ovarian reserve. I had blood panels done a month before this ectopic and it was all normal, so I have a good reference point. My AMH was 2.6 and FSH was 5. Perfect!\n\nIt took almost four months for my hcg to hit 0 and I decided to stop listening to the shitty advice of my shitty doctor.

Yes you can get this even if you didn't actually give birth. It is causes by a sudden dramatic shift in hormones. You don't have to go through this alone. \n\nI changed doctors and sought out a highly regarded fertility clinic here in California to try to figure out what the hell happened and why. Both my husband and I got tested again and well wouldn't you know! \n\nFirst, my AMH was essentially killed at 0.8 now along with my AFC at a mere 4 total, and FSH at a 9 and the rest of my hormones were complete shit. I'm like a couple of months away from being premenopausal. While mtx is only active in your body for 7 days, it damages the environment for proper egg growth for at least 180 days (Stanford study) and your egg reserve and quality will be shit until after that time is over. So I got a little bit of hope here at least.\n\nSecond, my hsg came back clear. Of course. Some of the studies I waltzed through show that up to 97.5% of women with ectopics actually have clear tubes when tested after the ectopic (note, HSGs can only test for structural issues, not functional ones like issues with ciliae, that you can only assess during a lap surgery. You're not likely to have functional issues unless you also have Endo or PCOS or other medical conditions). So I started to become suspicious of why that happened to me in the first place, since I have no other medical conditions. \nAll the doctors so far I had talked to said that ectopics are either just random or due to blocked tubes but that is actually only the minority of cases! The most likely and highly preventable cause is here: \n\nmy husband got another SA but this time, an \"advanced semen analysis report\" that also looks for DNA fragmentation. This does not get picked up by a regular SA. \nAnd what would you know.... Turns out he has pyospermia (white blood cells in his semen) that are the cause of his high DNA fragmentation (it should be ideally less than 8%, he is at 26%. You're considered infertile at 30%). Dna fragmentation doesn't stop you from conceiving, but it does cause ectopics and miscarriages, especially missed miscarriages. \nEven when doing IVF, because unless you ask for a DNA fragmentation test, they will commonly just do a regular semen analysis where this issue won't show, and you will likely make \"normal\" embryos, because even PGS testing doesn't pick up dna fragmentation, and you will keep getting ectopics and miscarriages, wondering what the f*.\nOnce you know your partner has DNA fragmentation, your IVF lab can use a special procedure during ivf to sort these broken guys out, lowering your risk of ectopics/miscarriages, called PICSI/zymot or just do TESE. \nWe decided on the ivf route because of our currently extremely high chance of miscarriage and ectopic and I cannot physically do another treatment for an ectopic and ruin the few eggs I have left. \nWhether or not you do IVF (because hello, cost), definitely also send your partner to a reproductive urologist to get a culture taken to cure whatever underlying inflammation there may be and check for varicoles. All this can cause DNA fragmentation, and it can be improved!\n\nWell now you know. \nGET YOUR MALE PARTNER'S SPERM TESTED FOR DNA FRAGMENTATION!\n\nIt aggravates me to no end that fertility issues/investigations always seem to be focusing the women, as if nothing could ever be wrong with the dudes. \n\nAnyway, hope my experience can help someone out there, good luck and keep pushing! Don't believe what your doctor is telling you, always double check, and get second and third opinions. \n\nI'll do another write up of all things HSG soon. \nThere aren't enough people talking about fertility issues and it's so nice to have a community to learn from and exchange knowledge and stories. \n\nSource of all this: me, 31F medical student specializing in public health.", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before my husband and I started TTC, we both got the basic tests done (blood panels, ultrasound and SA) and we both came back normal.\nSo no problem, right? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got pregnant on our first try, and bam, ectopic. \nA pretty traumatic one at that because I knew right away something wasn&amp;#39;t right yet the doctor didn&amp;#39;t believe me and waited until I was almost 9 weeks (!!!!!!!!) to send me to a specialist since she couldn&amp;#39;t find a sac or anything in my uterus or tubes and dismissed my requests for earlier ultrasounds.\nThe specialist found the growth in the fimbriae of my left tube right away and a few days later (!!!!

Don&amp;#39;t believe what your doctor is telling you, always double check, and get second and third opinions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll do another write up of all things HSG soon. \nThere aren&amp;#39;t enough people talking about fertility issues and it&amp;#39;s so nice to have a community to learn from and exchange knowledge and stories. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source of all this: me, 31F medical student specializing in public health.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EctopicSupportGroup", "subreddit_id": "t5_3hbq0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EctopicSupportGroup", "subreddit_subscribers": 722, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "PSA: get your male partner tested before trying again post ectopic", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "ups": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EctopicSupportGroup/comments/ht38v0/psa_get_your_male_partner_tested_before_trying/", "user_reports": [], "view_count": null, "visited": false, "whitelist_status": null, "wls": null}], "domain": "self.EctopicSupportGroup", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/ht39cw/all_things_post_ectopic_before_trying_again/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ht39cw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/ht39cw/all_things_post_ectopic_before_trying_again/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1595017765, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ectopicpregnancy", "subreddit_id": "t5_3flb7", "subreddit_subscribers": 163, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "All things post ectopic before trying again", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "/r/EctopicSupportGroup/comments/ht38v0/psa_get_your_male_partner_tested_before_trying/", "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/EctopicSupportGroup/comments/ht38v0/psa_get_your_male_partner_tested_before_trying/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "littlepiecesofdisast", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4x9qosw6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594894582, "domain": "self.ectopicpregnancy", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/hs72u1/period_after_ep/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hs72u1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/hs72u1/period_after_ep/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1594894593, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello,\n\nNot so long ago I experienced an EP.

I just thought, I would\u2019ve liked a little more information about what I was going through, when I was going through it, so I hope this helps someone. \n\nOk, so I was ttc for about 2 months, taking prenatal but no ovulation calendar or anything. (I\u2019m 32 years old and recently married.) I discovered some spotting and blood in my urine so I took a pregnancy test and it came back positive. I had no pain at this time. As I began planning for the pregnancy I kept noticing more bleeding/spotting/blood in urine than I could abide. I went to the clinic with a possible early miscarriage. They did some trans vaginal ultrasounds, but it was just too early to tell. \n\nA couple of weeks later, I returned. Still, I was experiencing the blood in urine, bleeding, and now, pelvic pressure. I was sure I was miscarrying. They did another ultrasound and confirmed that there was no baby in the uterus. My hgc levels were rising normally, and they saw a mass in my overy area and sent me to the emergency room. \n\nAt the emergency room they did another ultrasound and confirmed the ectopic pregnancy. They then injected me with methotrexate and sent me home with a couple of pain killers. I was told that because it was an early case, (less than 5 weeks) the fetus may be reabsorbed into my body and that I might not notice anything too out of the ordinary. \n\nSo here is the part I want any lady going though this to hear: \nI didn\u2019t feel anything out of the ordinary. I felt my body go back to normal with no pain, no passing of blood/clumps/anything and I felt myself go back to normal. \n\nEvery week after this injection I went back to measure my hgc levels. They went down accordingly, until I was only at 40 hgc. At that point my obgyn told me I was ok to begin my prenatal vitamins again and resume life. So I did. \n\nFor a week. To the hour, a week after I resumed prenatal vitamins, I had a sudden horrible pain in my abdomen which I can only describe as cramping, but filling with fluid, and 10/10 pain. My ectopic had ruptured. I went back to the emergency room (alone, my husband was not allowed because of the covid) and discovered that the methotrexate had not worked, unfortunately. \n\nMy obgyn came and removed my ectopic, along with my left Fallopian tube, and saved my life.

I did not go with her to her appointment because of the COVID situation, but she called me a few hours later, and said they could not proceed with the surgery because we had a suprise pregnancy. As much as we love eachother we're not financially ready to have a child, and we both came to the conclusion to take a trip to Planned Parenthood. We got our appointment at PP, two hours later she came back out visibly upset and told me they took two ultrasounds, a pregnancy test, and determined it was an ectopic pregnancy. I've been doing my research to help console her because shes a very anxious person, and this is something to definetly be anxious about.\n\nMy questions are; is it possible for the ultrasound to not detect anything? Shes 4 weeks pregnant with an HgC level of 88, and it seems odd that nothing could be traced what so ever. \n\nWhat are some more noticeable symptoms, and if you have any good tips to help ease the burden on her physically or mentally I would love that advice very much because I hate that she has to go through it alone.\n\nI understand it's a very serious situation, and in no way do I want to make light of what all of you have or are going through I'm trying to grasp the situation myself so I can be there for her and help her in anyway.

my mom a while back. she told me she got her tarot cards read the previous day and they had mentioned i would have a run in w the law (that would turn out okay, but would cause me a lot of stress). the day before, that exactly happened. i told her nothing about it. she called me the next day telling me she got them read again, and this time they mentioned an unexpected pregnancy that would happen to someone very close to her. she immediately called me, warning me and asking me to consider extra protection. i told her i would, took a few pregnancy tests out of fear, but eventually passed it off, i had an iud. \n\nmy mom had warned me that she gotten pregnant with with an iud. she was fearful for me too when i decided to go with this method. im in college. 5yrs no pregnancy risk seemed like a good deal.\n\ni experienced extreme cramping yesterday. my pms cramps had been horrible for the first 7 months of having the iud. they had finally subsided for a while, but within this last week or so they had come back. yesterday put the cherry on top though, as i fainted trying to get to the bathroom after sweating profusely.\n\ndecided i should check w the gyno, i knew this was abnormal, but a few google searches didnt really get me anywhere. \n\nnurse took my pee sample, i was definitely nervous, but she told me it looked okay. as i was waiting for my gyno to come in, my nurse came in instead. told me not to panic. the pregnancy test had a faint line for positive. i immediately broke down. \n\nmy gyno came in, tried to calm me down. she checked on the strings, told me they were okay. we proceeded to ultrasound anyway. they told me it looked fine. one thing stood out to the nurse and my gyno but they said it was probably bowel and kept reassuring me everything looked perfect. iud was in place. no issues. \n\nleft there in tears, passed a \u201cchoose life\u201d license plate on the way to my car. \n\nto make sure they ordered a blood test for me. they came back positive. ectopic pregnancy. \n\nstuck not knowing how to feel. somewhere between relief and some sort of guilt. howd i end up being the 0.1%?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false,

I just found out the day before yesterday I have what appears to be an ectopic pregnancy at 6 weeks into my very first pregnancy.\n\nSince this was/is my very first pregnancy,  I had no idea what to expect about first trimester symptoms...but on Monday when I began experiencing severe abdominal pain/pressure and violent vomiting with cold sweats... I knew this couldn't be \"normal.\"  I called my doc and asked for a sonogram asap to check things out because I was worried it could be an ectopic pregnancy... not really believing it actually would be because... what are the odds right?\n\nWell the odds weren't in my favor apparently.  They did a sono that afternoon and saw loose fluid from my left fallopian tube, and couldn't locate the pregnancy in my uterus... so I got admitted to stay in the hospital overnight for observation and to wait and see if my hcg levels would go down on their own and also make sure I didn't need emergency surgery.\n\n\\*\\* side note: Being checked into a hospital during this COVID crisis is NOT FUN. No visitors...my husband was kicked out and I had to receive scary/hard news alone without him.\n\nMy hcg levels increased a bit next day (yesterday) and I had another sono... still showing loose fluid around my left ovary and in the cul-de-sac.  The doc who did my sono (not my regular obygyn) seemed to be pushing that I should have a surgery done sooner than later to resolve this since there's loose fluid.  However my regular obgyn said we could wait a little more since I wasn't in pain anymore (it subsided Monday evening) and she doesn't think I'm in imminent danger at this time.  She still thinks there's a chance my body will resolve the ectopic pregnancy on its own without needing intervention.\n\nSo here I am... still pregnant, but waiting to see if my body will \"resolve\" things on its own.  Never thought I'd be in this situation where I'm actively hoping my body terminates the pregnancy on its own to avoid a surgery or the shots.  I really hate this.

I waited a week for that dinner. Not a bite did I get to taste. These cramps wouldn&amp;#39;t go away. I spent the night on all fours feeling so dizzy and so faint. Came the morning 7am, I decided to go to the ER. Didn&amp;#39;t make it past the kitchen when we realized 911 was the best choice at that point. I couldn&amp;#39;t move, that pain, it felt like my insides were being torn apart. When paramedics got here it all went so fast, I don&amp;#39;t remember much. One thing I do remember is being told so many times about the romaine lettuce recall. How so many people nationwide are going in with the same symptoms. But I kept saying it wasnt that. I know my body. Its something to do with my uterus, MY PUSSY HURTS!!!. Sorry, just at that point I was there already just wanting them to take that pain away. I kept insisting it was a infection down there maybe. But kept telling them it has nothing to do with what they keep thinking. It wasn&amp;#39;t the lettuce. Finally sent me into an ultrasound. I was crying out of pain and because I didnt feel the respect for the level of pain I was in. I was literally dying. Maybe its because it was a private hospital, even though I still have good insurance through my husbands job. It&amp;#39;s just not that hospitals insurance. Either way that should never be a problem when it comes to life or death. I noticed the doctors worry during the ultrasound. I just wanted to know. Was I pregnant. When it was confirmed. How I wished for an infection instead. The results were. I had an ectopic pregnancy. I was 12 weeks pregnant, it ruptured my left fallopian tube. I had internal bleeding. 1 liter and a half. My body was in shock. Had emergency surgery. My left tube removed. Two blood transfusions. Like I had thought, I was dying. I am grateful they saved my life. I am 28. Be 29 on womans day. I still have no kids. Married for a decade so far. This is still so fresh and new. Trying to figure out how to process this. I almost feel guilty. I want to be mad but just dont know at who. Im hurt. broken. pist. angry. every emotion all at once. Because reality is... I would of gave my life for my sweet baby if I could. This experience has broken me beyond. Worse part is I isolated myself for years because my family had become real toxic so imagine how alone I feel now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EctopicSupportGroup", "subreddit_id": "t5_3hbq0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EctopicSupportGroup", "subreddit_subscribers": 446, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Why Me", "total_awards_received": 0, "ups": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EctopicSupportGroup/comments/e69esp/why_me/", "user_reports": [], "view_count": null, "visited": false, "whitelist_status": null, "wls": null}], "domain": "self.EctopicSupportGroup", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/e69jpe/my_broken_heart/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e69jpe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/e69jpe/my_broken_heart/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575508938, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ectopicpregnancy", "subreddit_id": "t5_3flb7", "subreddit_subscribers": 80, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "My broken heart", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EctopicSupportGroup/comments/e69esp/why_me/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sarahhoehn99", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_220oxoeg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574614614, "domain": "self.ectopicpregnancy", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/e11174/period_after_surgery/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e11174", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/e11174/period_after_surgery/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574614615, "score": 1, "selftext": "Wondering if it\u2019s normal to miss your period the month after surgery and removal of my tube/if possible to get pregnant right away?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ectopicpregnancy", "subreddit_id": "t5_3flb7", "subreddit_subscribers": 75, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Period after surgery", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/e11174/period_after_surgery/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "centraluk", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4d1bvzfe", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570470826, "domain": "self.ectopicpregnancy", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/den12w/how_did_my_doc_not_know/", "gildings": {}, "id": "den12w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/den12w/how_did_my_doc_not_know/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570470827, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello all.

Was not trying to get pregnant but did and was sure it would be another ectopic in the tube.  Found out it was not, it is in fact in the uterus, to my utter shock.  However, of course, it's close to the cornual and there is a chance it could turn into an ectopic. It could grow up into the tube, causing tube/uterus to rupture.  It may grow into the top of the uterus, causing a uteran rupture.  It could grow into the uteran cavitiy as an angular pregnancy which has its own list of complications.  \n\nThis one is very scary.  If it grows into the first two areas it is extremely dangerous and I go back for my next ultra sound next Friday.  I was able to get it to that day by saying I need to know sooner than the two week wait they gave me, this would still be an 11 day wait.  I have seven to go after I sleep tonight.  \n\nInstructions were if I have bad pain or bleeding call right away or go to the ER.  Every single pain stops me abruptly as I wonder, is this it, is this the rupture starting.  I think about this all day.  I worry about it all day.  I'm using the bathroom multiple times per day looking for any sign of blood.  It's taking over my life and I'm scared and stressed all the time.  \n\nI feel like an absolute shit human being for saying this but I just want this to be over.  I think all the time that I should just end the pregnancy before it gets further along.  But I can't unless I know for sure it's not viable.

Until about 3 weeks after, I had this small spot of pressure on my lower left abdomen that was uncomfortable when I pressed down it lasted a few days until I had a quick 10 min otp dr appt and she said it could be a cyst and told me to make an ultrasound appt. The week after I had cramping and random heavy bleeding with some dark discharge, i don\u2019t bleed at all with my iud so it was out of the ordinary. Along with dense sore breasts, frequent urinating, nausea and headaches (I very rarely get headaches). I only was able to eat a small amount of pho earlier and even right now I feel nauseous and wanting to throw it up. I took a pregnancy test 4weeks after sex, negative.

This is all TMI- I\u2019ve had a hormonal IUD for about 5 years. I haven\u2019t had a period that entire time. Friday I noticed really strange discharge I\u2019ve never seen before, Saturday I had really heavy bleeding, Sunday was heavy bleeding with large chunks of flesh (took photos to show doc because I knew it would seem like I was exaggerating). Also shoulder pain which is why google searching my symptoms brought me here lol Honestly I\u2019ve had heavy periods and even ovarian cysts resulting in emergency surgery but never seen anything like this- pain was about a 7. I\u2019ve had ovarian cysts rupture and that was an off the charts pain that made me vomit and pass out- so this was really bad but manageable. By 9pm Sunday the pain went down to a 2 or 3 and by the morning the bleeding pretty much stopped. \n\nI\u2019ve been on the phone all day trying to schedule an appointment with my doctor, thinking (naively) I could get in today. The soonest I can be seen is a few weeks. Pain is still at a 3 mostly at my right ovary. Should I bother with emergency room at this point? I have insurance but will still likely end up paying some out of pocket. \n\nI\u2019ve read that you can randomly have a period with an IUD but this was unlike any period I\u2019ve ever had.

We lost our baby and my right fallopian tube in May when I was 7 weeks pregnant. We had gone for the appointment to hear the heartbeat beat of our very loved little lentil. Instead, I was rushed to surgery with no time to process anything. During the salpingectomy, the surgeon realized I had endometriosis and it was BAD. So bad that he had to surgically release my left tube from all of the scar tissue that had twisted and \"strangled\" my only remaining hope for natural conception and use an anti-adhesion barrier to hopefully hold it in the correct anatomical position.\nAfter this experience, we decided to go to a fertility specialist and the months of tests and procedures began. In the end, we found out my remaining tube had \"potential\" but wasn't considered healthy, my uterus is shaped like a heart (which makes implantation difficult and can cause complications with early delivery), I have really low egg count for being only 31 and in addition to the endometriosis, my suspicions of PCOS was confirmed too. It feels like everything that could be wrong is wrong with me in regards to my reproductive system, has one issue or more. Because I do have one tube left, IUI is an option that was offered but I will have to take clomid to increase my egg count. If it results in another ectopic we will have to move forward with IVF in order to bypass my tube. I guess I'm looking for anyone who can relate?

Or the universe thinking it was doing the right thing, even though I didn\u2019t want proof like that I could have them. \nJust for it to be removed and one of my tubes too. \nI feel like it\u2019s my fault because I didn\u2019t want it, when I should of been grateful given the anxiety I had about life and such, before realising I was pregnant. \n\nI know that\u2019s completely illogical but my faulty wonk brains rusty cogs continue to do their thing. \nJust wanted to vent about it. \nI don\u2019t really have a mother or anyone close I can just express these stupid thought loops / anxieties to. I should be grateful for my health but I\u2019m not. I screamed when I found out I was pregnant. \nBut somehow this feels more wrong than that did. \nHopefully the new medication for my head wonk that I started probably around the time I got pregnant, will actually start to work abit now. \n/wowlifeisreallytedious", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ectopicpregnancy", "subreddit_id": "t5_3flb7", "subreddit_subscribers": 472, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ectopic pregnanc guilt ???", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/q2orba/ectopic_pregnanc_guilt/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ChaoticBlueDaisy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_51lq8y7s", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1633373108, "domain": "self.ectopicpregnancy", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/q1bz72/anyone_have_experience_with_ureaplasma/", "gildings": {}, "id": "q1bz72", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/q1bz72/anyone_have_experience_with_ureaplasma/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1633373119, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi!

for information on what just happened and affirmation that we are not alone. She doesn't use reddit but I find it helpful and will pass information along as appropriate. We had been trying for a year and were both extremely excited when it finally happened. \n\nYesterday was her 8 week check in and the docs told her it was ectopic. They ended up doing the most invasive version of removal and had to take one fallopian tube with it. She was okay after surgery, physically stable, emotions not quite setting in yet. I sat with her till about midnight, due to covid I couldn't sleep there. At about 3am she texted me and said she had several seizures and they found a hematoma. I talked with the nurse and they said the hematoma will be drained today. Really hoping for no more complications with that. She'll probably have to stay in the hospital another night.\n\nFrom what I've read on other posts its going to be a long road. They told her that we cannot try again for another year which is going to be one of the hardest thing on us. And on top of that, if it does happen it will need to be delivered via c-section. We will together fight through anything we have to. \n\nI hope I dont sound like I'm trying to take the attention, she is ultimately the one most affected and will be going through many more emotions than I will know or understand. I just want to be there for her, be her man, her rock, her shoulder, as I always strive to be. I love her more than anything in the whole world and want to take care of her in the most supportive way possible without being overbearing. She will not get over this quickly, I will not get over this quickly. \n\nAround the same time as conception (8 weeks ago), we lost our 2 dogs within 1 week of eachother, both due to unexpected and rare conditions.

It's especially frustrating because hiking, walking, and being in nature all help me feel better with most things, but I can't do any of them. My husband's family tries to be supportive by saying they're sure we will have a baby soon.... But that doesn't remotely help. My family has never been helpful or supportive and can't understand why I'm so sad if I still have one fallopian tube left. I have so many moments of breaking down and not being able to collect myself for hours. My days are blurring together at this point and I'm not back at work for another week and a half.

I felt really uncared for in the ER and dont want to go there just tot wait a ridiculous time again when i am in discomfort but i also dont want to call 999 because i feel guilty for using it when there could be someone dying that needs it more than me.\n\nThis morning i took another pregnancy test and it came back negative, so im really confused.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice, im really worried", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ectopicpregnancy", "subreddit_id": "t5_3flb7", "subreddit_subscribers": 415, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ectopic pregnancy with Nexplanon implant", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/owzn7b/ectopic_pregnancy_with_nexplanon_implant/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Cool_Distribution537", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7q5t1om1", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1627949271, "domain": "self.ectopicpregnancy", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/owrek9/methotrexate/", "gildings": {}, "id": "owrek9", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/owrek9/methotrexate/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1627949282, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I had a ectopic pregnancy and my dr couldn\u2019t find where it was at.. she said I should just get the injection, I got my injection 6days ago and it was hell the first 4 days\u2026 now my bleeding seems to be so much lighter my appetite is back but I still have some gas pain, pelvic inflammation, constipation\u2026 I still have a  little achy spot on my lower right side of my pelvis close to the Pubic bone.

I\u2019ll just explain what is happening right now.\n\nThe short version: tender breasts and mild nausea were weird, so even though I have an IUD I took two pregnancy tests that came back positive. Called OB, was sent to ER. There my beta HCG was 97, and ultrasounds found nothing. Had another draw today but no results yet. Am noticing a decline in pregnancy symptoms and am also noticing right-sided lower back and lower pelvic pain, extending to the right hip. \n\nI (29f) have had IUDs as birth control for seven years with no problems. The current IUD I have has been in for 2 years and five months, and has worked perfectly. I NEVER get periods. I may rarely get breast tenderness or very mild cramps, but this is such a rare occurrence it\u2019s not bothersome. I love having an IUD, because before this I had extremely heavy, extremely irregular, and extremely painful periods. \n\nAbout a week ago, I noticed my breasts were verrry tender, very sensitive. Moreso than any rare-but-within-the-norm breast tenderness that has ever happened with an IUD in the past. My partner mentioned pregnancy jokingly and we laughed it off as being impossible. I have never even had a pregnancy scare with an IUD. But the tender breasts continued for a few days. Then, on day four I noticed mild nausea after eating. By day 5, I convinced myself to take a pregnancy test for \u201cpeace of mind\u201d but was shocked and terrified to find a positive result. \n\nI called OB who sent me to the ER. At the ER, I had blood drawn, a urine test, a uterine ultrasound and a transvaginal ultrasound. Ultrasounds showed my IUD was still in its correct place. No evidence of where the embryo is though, they couldn\u2019t find it anywhere. They said there was something they saw that had a weird word like tumor or cyst with it that was evidence that the egg may have gone to the uterus, but really it was too early to tell where it was or what was happening. My beta HcG was 97. I had another blood draw today but won\u2019t know the results until next week. \n\nMy breasts are no longer tender. I\u2019m not experiencing nausea now. I have had one very slight incidence of spotting, brown blood. Otherwise, any discharge has been thick, sticky, and sort of an off white color. I am cramping, mostly on the right side, low down and both front and back, even extending into my hip sort of? The cramps seem to be slightly worsening, but Idk if that is because I\u2019m being hypervigilant in paying attention to my body or if it really is worsening. \n\nI\u2019m searching for support and advice. I\u2019m scared. I have had one previous pregnancy of spontaneous identical twins resulting in a C-section at 38 weeks. It was healthy. This time, I am terrified.

They did an US intrauterine and transvaginal and found nothing (they said it\u2019s expected since HCG under 1000). Also I peed before my ultrasound so not sure if they were able to see anything.

I was administered methotrexate that day.\n-541 on July 12, 5 day follow up. Bleeding at this point stopped. \n\nIs it possible that I had a regular miscarriage bc I bled?

My HCG level was ~1900 but they were not able to see a pregnancy with a vaginal sonogram. We figured it may be too early, so my doctor had me wait a week to return and try again. 2nd visit and they were still unable to locate the pregnancy. My obgyn determined it was too risky to continue the pregnancy (My hcg level that day was 4300)I was sent directly to the hospital and we agreed to move forward with Methotrexate to treat what we all assumed was an ectopic pregnancy. This was a whirlwind of emotions in itself! \n\nThe treatment was rough on me physically, I felt tired all the time and the non-folate diet was incredibly hard to follow. Emotionally, I was heartbroken - My fianc\u00e9 and I were looking forward to starting a family and was beginning to worry that we may need fertility treatments. \n\nFast forward a week after my second dose of methotrexate, I woke up with the worst cramps ever. We rushed to the ER and discovered that although the treatment was working and my hcg was now at 1100, my Fallopian tube ruptured and they had to immediately remove the tube. At this point they were still not able to locate it so they would have to go into both tubes with a camera to find it (later learned it was in the left tube near opening by the ovaries). \n\nNow, here I am 5 days post-op and physically and emotionally I am a wreck. The pain has subsided and able to walk around and do things like cook and some light cleaning, but I am experiencing diarrhea and gas.

At first I thought I was being ridiculous and it was just wind/gas but it was unbearable! It was all in the left side and I didn't think it'd be anything worse. \nI went to my GP and she examined me, she didn't think ectopic but could be a miscarriage. I was told if the pain got worse, I'd need to go to the emergency department at the hospital. There was no bleeding at all.\n\nAround 4 hours later, my partner took me to the hospital and due to the pandemic he wasn't allowed in with me. \nFor anyone in the UK, wait times in accident and emergency are crazy (this isn't me speaking bad of the NHS, they were amazing through this whole situation, I just believe they are overworked!) I waited 7 hours to be seen - at this point I hadn't eaten or drank anything as I couldn't keep it down. \nMy blood pressure was really low and heart rate was really high. I couldn't lie down to be examined without screaming in pain as the pain had now made its was up my body into my chest and shoulder. \n\nI finally got to the gynecology unit around 11 hours after getting into hospital and then another 4 hour wait before I was examined and scanned. That's where they found the pregnancy, a ruptured ectopic. \n\nThe next couple of hours were a whirlwind, with surgeons, nurses and consultants talking to me, asking me questions and signing forms. I was then taken down for surgery.\n\nAll this time my partner had been at home waiting to hear from me. (I sent him home about 11pm!) \n\nFinally made it back to the ward and contacted him and had a little cry that he wasn't there for a hug! \n\nI later found out that I lost 1.5 litres of blood :| \n\nI'm now 4 weeks after surgery and I think I'm nearly at peace with what happened. \nI cried for days after and then the guilt kicks in and everything else!

Am back at home recovering in bed and wanted to share my story in case it helps anyone in a similar position. \n\nMy partner and I had been trying to conceive since October. We have one daughter \u2013 3.5 years old \u2013 who is amazing, and thought it would be best to try for a second before I turned 39 this summer. In early May, I tested positive with a couple of home pregnancy tests the week I was expecting my period. I then set an appointment with the OB/GYN for what I assumed would be at the 7-week mark to date the pregnancy and assess viability. The transvaginal ultrasound, however, showed very little \u2013 just a tiny bubble that looked a lot smaller than what the gestational sac should have looked like, with a thick uterine lining. My HCG levels that day were 1500. A follow up appointment was set for 10 days later (at my urging, because the office wanted to do it 14 days later). That weekend, however, I had what I assumed was a typical miscarriage \u2013 I had a lot of cramping and passed a lot of blood, including a large empty sac-looking thing (approx. 2 inches by 1.5 inches). I informed my OB/GYN and then four days later went in for a follow up. \n\nAt this follow up a regular abdominal sonogram was done, which showed a thin uterine lining and empty uterus. There was a cyst on my ovary that they thought was normal due to recent ovulation, but nothing else was seen that raised cause for suspicion. The next day, I found out my HCG levels were even higher \u2013 1800 \u2013 but my follow up appointment was set for a week later to monitor (Thursday morning).\n\nTuesday night, however \u2013 around 11:30 pm \u2013 I started experiencing a lot of pain in the abdomen. At first it felt more like horrible gas/cramps, and I thought it was in reaction to something I ate. It reminded me of bad pain I had when I had gone to central America years prior and drank unpasteurized milk\u2026so I decided to stay home for while to see if it would go away. My husband was working out of state and I had no one to watch my daughter, which also added to my hesitancy to going to the ER unnecessarily. The pain then subsided a bit and I was able to rest for a while\u2026but a few hours later it worsened and started to spread into my chest and shoulders when I would breathe. I called my primary care physician to leave a message with the 24 hour emergency line \u2013 when they called me back a few moments later, they urged me to call the OB/GYN when that office opened at 8 am \u2013 due to the recent miscarriage - or go to the ER if the pain became unbearable. \n\nWe finally went to the ER in the morning, after my mother drove in from 3 hours away to help with my daughter.  I was extremely faint and dizzy, not able to stand up without blacking out a few minute later. We decided not to call an ambulance and instead she drove me to the hospital (Mt Sinai on UES in NYC) associated with all my doctors as I figured having access to my pre-existing information would be helpful. \n\nAfter arriving at the ER I explained my history and they were concerned by both the pain, recent HCG levels, and the fact that my heart rate was high (approx. 110) and blood pressure was low (82/50). I was sent for an ultrasound, but couldn\u2019t lay down due to the pain, so sent back out to the ER floor for pain meds. After not being seen for 50 minutes, and starting to cry in desperation from the pain and difficulty breathing, I flagged down a nurse to demand the meds, leading to a morphine shot. Felt slightly better and was sent back to get an X ray and then ultrasound. Still could not lay down for the ultrasound, so they did what they could at an angle, and then I was sent back out to the ER floor. Within about an hour, an OB/GYN doctor and PA found me to have me \u2018re-tell\u2019 from my POV all my history and symptoms so they could confirm what was going on. They then informed me that due to what they saw on imaging, they were rather certain it was an ectopic pregnancy that had ruptured \u2013 including the fact that there was large amount of fluid in my abdomen. Within 20 mins I was being whisked to the OR, signed papers consenting to everything, including the knowledge they would most likely have to remove a fallopian tube and ovary. \n\nThe worst part was having to transfer myself to the OR table with pain level at 9, and then having lay back flat while not just in pain, but crying that I couldn\u2019t breathe, as with every breath I took I felt my chest and throat seize. Finally just tried to focus to take small breaths so I could pass out \u2013 and woke up 2 hours later post-operation in the recovery room. \n\nPost-operation, I was able to speak to the doctors who did the surgery and they said I had an interstitial ectopic pregnancy that ruptured \u2013 the rarest kind with most severe complications. The left fallopian tube and ovary was removed, which mirrored what they had seen in the ultrasound (they went in thinking it would be the right side). They removed 1.5 liters of blood from my abdominal cavity and \u2013 in their words \u2013 \u2018saved my life\u2019. It\u2019s possible that if a few more hours had gone by, I wouldn\u2019t be here, or would at least have had to go to the ICU. Instead, I just required a blood transfusion and stayed in the hospital for one night for monitoring. \n\nThe pain was bad in the first hours post-operation, but after getting oxycodone and other meds throughout the night, was able to keep it under control. I was released the next day in the early afternoon \u2013 that was yesterday. Came home and took a 3 hour nap, and then slept 10 hours at night. Today (Friday), I\u2019m in bed recovering with alternating high doses of Tylenol and Advil. I have a follow up appointment on Tuesday to make sure everything is healing as it should.\n\nMoral of story \u2013 if you have any inclination at all that you could be experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, don\u2019t hesitate to demand frequent follow up. The doctors said that due to the type of ectopic pregnancy I had (interstitial) , the chances of being able to see anything on the sonogram was low in my earlier appointments \u2013 nevertheless, considering the fact that my HCG levels were increasing and not decreasing, with no visible embryo, I should have had some more frequent monitoring. I also didn\u2019t do enough to take my own pain seriously when it first started at night \u2013 the severity of it, combined with the horrible dizziness was certainly a sign that something was not right. I probably should have gone to the hospital right away instead of trying to wait it out at home. \n\nWill keep the post updated once I hear more at my follow up next week, in case any one is interested. I\u2019m still trying to wrestle with everything that happened \u2013 physically and emotionally \u2013 including the trauma that is realizing I was a few hours away from much more severe implications. I will never forget saying a prayer while being wheeled into the OR, hoping to say alive for my beautiful daughter. I wish that experience on no one.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ectopicpregnancy", "subreddit_id": "t5_3flb7", "subreddit_subscribers": 360, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Almost Died from Interstitial Ectopic Pregnancy", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/nxphmf/almost_died_from_interstitial_ectopic_pregnancy/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Catgiggles", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bsh9cx1j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1623355435, "crosspost_parent": "t3_nwvy29", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "Catgiggles", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bsh9cx1j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1623381485.0, "created_utc": 1623352685.0, "discussion_type": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.EctopicSupportGroup", "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": true, "id": "nwvy29", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": null, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": null, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_nwvy29", "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 1, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/EctopicSupportGroup/comments/nwvy29/baby_registry_item_donations/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "removed_by": null, "removed_by_category": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 1, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Amazon sent a complementary box of baby items after I created a registry with them.

I didn\u2019t know I could even have children, but was playing it safe while getting back into dating and taking birth control (which, I discovered after that it was expired). \n\nBefore I knew I was pregnant I had some weird symptoms. I had a normal period April 9. Then another not normal period April 28. I had no cramps or other symptoms, I recall only needing to use a pad once or twice and then liners the rest of the time because it was so light. \n\nAround the time I expected my usual period the next month I woke up in the middle of the night with a very severe lower back pain on my right side. I had been having UTI like symptoms and was taking a probiotic. I got up to pee and nearly passed out. I didn\u2019t have any ibuprofen or other pain relievers on hand so I just rode it out. I think the next weekend I purchased a UTI test and a pregnancy test just to rule things out. I took them both at the same time. UTI test negative, pregnancy positive. I\u2019ve taken 6 other tests since then and all positive. \n\nMy symptoms remain as SEVERE boob pain (like the only way they don\u2019t hurt is if I wear a bra 24/7\u2026 I\u2019m a member of the itty bitty titty committee so this is a struggle), mild to severe cramping just on my right side, very little nausea, and my pee smells horrid to me. I bled pretty bad during sex one evening, but that was the only time. I woke up at 5:30am last night to an intense pain on the same right side that felt like something was trying to claw its way out of my abdomen. I had to wake my (now) boyfriend up and have him get me Tylenol and a heating pad. It eventually went away but I woke up this morning feeling like I got hit by a bus. The cramping still continues on and off on the right side today. \n\nI have my first prenatal appointment in the next 2 weeks. I am currently 5 weeks.

In 2012, I had my first ectopic (did not even know I was pregnant) and my left fallopian tube ended up rupturing and I had to have emergency surgery and lost that tube. Last year, Feb 2020, I had my 2nd ectopic but caught it early because I track everything and my husband and I have been actively TTC for the past 2 years but know we have to be careful and track everything with my history. I was given 1 dose of Methotrexate last year and since my beta HCG levels were only around 300 it worked. I did have to follow a strict low folic acid diet . Last month I found out I was pregnant but it was too early to see anything on an ultrasound and my levels were only around 550. The next week, the found a mass on my right ovary adjacent to my tube but they could not tell if it was a cyst or the location of the ectopic and my levels were rising appropriately. Two weeks later, I thought I was miscarrying because I was bleeding heavily and cramping and my levels had dropped by 50% but after doing an ultrasound, my dr found that the mass ending up growing 1 cm so I was given methotrexate last Wednesday. My levels dropped from day 1 to 4 but went from 387 to 549 on days 4 to 7 so I was given a second round of methotrexate last night. I am praying this round works because my dr said that if it doesnt, I have to have surgery to completely remove my right tube which is the only one I have. I am not mentally prepared to handle that. Not being able to conceive on my own is slowly destroying me. I am severely struggling mentally this time around. I did not think I even had a blockage in my right tube because I just did an HSG test last year and the dye flowed through my right tube and no blockages were present. My Dr said that she cannot remove the ectopic in my right tube without damaging the tube so she would just have to completely remove it. I'm so confused because the ectopic is not in my tube according to the ultrasound. It is on my ovary, next to my tube. Does anyone happen to know if it is possible to remove the ectopic without damaging the tube? I honestly do not have a lot of faith in this dr as she is young and just finished her residency last year and has only had 2 patients with ectopic pregnancies (I didnt ask for details on how those ectopics were handled, even though I probably should have) and I dont have a lot of trust in her as I just started seeing her last month. I'm so sorry for the long post, I'm just hurting, confused, terrified, and anxious. I am praying this dose works and we do not have to remove my last good tube.

I've been feeling more weak and tired than usual over the past week, which is weird because I'm currently on summer break for a week now and don't have any current stressors. Since yesterday, my cramps started to feel more like infrequent stabbing and localized pressure pains in certain areas, including my uterus, vagina, rectum, and abdomen. Last night, I was constipated and nauseated for about an hour, and had some stabbing pain in my stomach (which is unusual for me). I am also currently experiencing mild pain in my upper left thigh, which is common during my period. \n\nI've done some research and learned that most of those symptoms are common among ectopic pregnancies. My next period is supposed to start in one week. If I take a pregnancy test now, would the result be accurate or should I wait until a later day? I really hope that all those symptoms are only caused by my IUD, but I want to rule out the possibility that it could be an ectopic pregnancy. I'll know for sure if I miss my next period.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ectopicpregnancy", "subreddit_id": "t5_3flb7", "subreddit_subscribers": 346, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What were your ectopic pregnancy symptoms before your first missed period?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/ngh9u0/what_were_your_ectopic_pregnancy_symptoms_before/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mariamango2", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_51zyhwks", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1621360603, "domain": "self.ectopicpregnancy", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/nfhesq/methotrexate_treatment_failures_after_7_days/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nfhesq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/nfhesq/methotrexate_treatment_failures_after_7_days/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1621360614, "score": 1, "selftext": "Has anyone experienced an unsuccessful methotrexate treatment even after a successful decline on day 7?\n\nI\u2019m traveling internationally for three weeks this Saturday.

Furthermore, it was dead when they cut it out of me. Other gems were \u201cI lost both my parents and husband ( um he was my dad too. I also lost him ) and that\u2019s real loss.

I was especially hurt because it was brought to my attention my ex has been teaching these weird sermons (???) about me and my ectopic pregnancy in a religious blog he writes his sermons in. He speaks to and preaches to teenagers and young adults in a local church. Me stealing his virginity and having this life threatening pregnancy is used as a cautionary tale to them to abstain from it and was the \u2018best thing that ever happened\u2019 to him because \u2018God wasn\u2019t letting him settle for the lesser than the greater\u2019 god has in store for him. The prudent wife he\u2019s waiting for.\n\nHe quoted this verse: \u201cI am the true vine, and my father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch in me that bares no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be ever fruitful.\u201d \n\nWhen I read what he said about me and the lies he was spreading and backing up with bible verses online and to his youth group ( he keeps and writes his speeches online ) I felt a burning in my chest went numb. This is coming from a man ( and I use this term loosely ) who would verbally abuse me and refused to let me out of his apartment until he kicked me out.\n\nThe title of my ectopic pregnancy on this blog is called \u2018Sin and Regret.\u2019 If you guys are interested I may post it here.\n\nI wish I had my family to support me.

We had an unexpected ectopic pregnancy 6 years ago while I was on progestin only BC and was told the reason it happened was due to the BC. I had to have emergency surgery for that ectopic, it was in my left tube and they were able to save my tube. I recovered fine physically and emotionally because that baby wasn\u2019t planned and we weren\u2019t in a place to care for a baby at the time. \n\nThis pregnancy was planned and wanted, due to my history my doctor had been monitoring my hCG and I had an early ultrasound scheduled for 4/5. Everything seemed to be fine but then I had severe pain on my right side and lower back like the last ectopic and ended up in the ER on 4/5 and had to have emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy in my right tube. During the surgery my OB also removed blockage from my left tube that was from the last surgery and did a dye test to see if my tubes were blocked and it seems both of them are blocked. My OB recommends having both my tubes removed and using IVF moving forward. \n\nI\u2019m absolutely gutted. I\u2019ll start to feel okay but then I\u2019ll feel so sad and feel like not only was a pregnancy taken from me but also my fertility. I also feel extremely frustrated, the chances of having ectopics it\u2019s so low and I\u2019ve now had one in each tube and I don\u2019t have any answers as to why. I have to go back to work on Monday and I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to face work or even my friends. I feel extremely alone and the only person I feel comfortable around is my husband. \n\nHas anyone had 2 ectopics and ever gotten an answer as to why or know what questions to ask my OB at my follow up?

This morning I woke up, went pee and wiped to see blood by surprise. My period is pretty predictable and usually comes between the 25-27 of each month, which is why I was surprised to see the blood. I continued to get my daughters ready for school, but continued to feel spotting/trickling in my underwear. I went to check on things again in the bathroom and had some spotting in my underwear as well as drops of blood in the toilet and on the toilet paper. I was also feeling lightheaded and had a headache. By the time I dropped my girls off I was feeling a little concerned, about a potential ectopic pregnancy. Kind of far fetched I know- but in my gut that\u2019s all I could think about (I had a tubal ligation with my c/s from 2019)... so I grabbed a pregnancy test on the way home, took it and it was negative. This doesn\u2019t surprise me, because I am still 7-10 days away from expecting my period to begin with... As the afternoon progresses I\u2019m still spotting, and have a slight cramping sensation on the left side of my belly about a hands width down from my belly button and a slight urge to poop, but nothing comes out. I\u2019m still lightheaded and have some neck stiffness as well. I have a phone call in to my obgyn, but thought I\u2019d see if any of you have any past experience? Why else would I have spotting? If it helps, my lmp was Jan 24th through 27th ish and my husband and I last had sex 1/29. IF it were an EP, would this be too soon to be having symptoms anyway?

honestly didn\u2019t even really know about it until I was one of the unfortunate women that had to go through it for the first time in 2018. I always worried about fertility issues or miscarriage or still births (all absolutely horrendous situations as well) but ectopic was not even in the back of my mind.\n\nI know I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s been through this nor will I be the last. \n\nI can\u2019t even put into words the gut wrenching feeling that came over me the first time I was diagnosed in June 2018. I had no idea I was pregnant for almost 2 months before I took a test (obviously I wasnt tracking my cycles at the time...oops.) literally the day after I got my positive pregnancy test I started having extreme pain. Pain that doubled me over and tears running down my face. I knew something was wrong. This first pregnancy wasn\u2019t planned but honestly, as soon as I got the positive I started planning my husband and my future with our new baby in my head. I could picture a little one with us and how our lives would be. That all got ripped away.\nI spent 5 days in the hospital with what they define as a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL.) I got countless blood tests and many ultrasounds until finally my gynaecologist diagnosed it as a non viable pregnancy. I had the option to either receive a double shot of methotrexate which is a chemotherapy drug that kills fast developing cells which ultimately ends the non viable pregnancy or I could have laparoscopic surgery. I chose methotrexate. \nAfter the shot, the pain doesn\u2019t end there. Methotrexate depletes your body of folate and makes you feel like absolute garbage in general. You have to get blood tests constantly to monitor your HCG (pregnancy hormone) to ensure the medication is in fact working. I was miserable. On top of the sickness from the medication, you still feel completely pregnant. It\u2019s extremely hard. You bleed, you pass clots and it can take a very long time for your HCG to reach non pregnant levels. The scariest part of this is that until your levels go below 5 you are still at risk of the ectopic rupturing where ever it is implanted. This is a medical emergency and you can hemorrhage and bleed out internally very quickly. You have to have someone with you 24/7 incase you rupture because the pain is usually so severe that you pass out. Luckily I have the best mother in the world who flew to Newfoundland from New Brunswick to stay with me. I couldn\u2019t work, I couldn\u2019t do housework, I couldn\u2019t do light lifting AT ALL for the risk of rupture was there.\nWith this first experience it took me almost 2 months for my hormones to reach non pregnant levels and pregnancy symptoms to subside. \nAfter your levels reach 0 you have to start taking folic acid again to replenish your body and can\u2019t start trying for another baby for 3 months as methotrexate can harm a fetus and lack of folate can cause birth defects. \nSteve and I decided not to try again until after our wedding in 2019. \nIn that time I got an HSG test done to check if my tubes were clear which is a pretty uncomfortable proceedure that they put a catheter up through and push dye through your Fallopian tubes. To my surprise and happiness - my tubes were clear and looked perfect.\n\nFlash forward to December 2019 - we decided this was our month. We tried again and found out we were pregnant again the second week of January. I couldn\u2019t believe we got pregnant again so quick. I felt so lucky that we could get pregnant easily and we were scared but also excited. I honestly believed this would work out. About a week after finding out I was pregnant I doubled over at work, sweating and felt like I was in the worst pain of my life. I thought I was going to pass out. It\u2019s a pain I can\u2019t describe and unlike anything I\u2019ve ever felt with anything else. I knew it was ectopic again. \nI went to the hospital in the morning after work as I was on night shift. They did an ultrasound and immediately found my ectopic in my left tube. \nOnce again, I chose methotrexate. I mean, who wants to go into surgery if you can avoid it, right? \nI was able to go home from the hospital the same day with the promise that someone would be with me to monitor me 24/7. My amazing mom came once again to stay with me so that Steve could go back to work. \n\nThis time it took about 5 weeks for my levels to drop to 0.\n\n5 weeks of feeling pregnant and knowing our child wouldn\u2019t survive.\n5 weeks of feeling like absolute death from methotrexate.\n5 weeks of emotional turmoil.\n5 weeks of wondering what I did to cause this. \n5 weeks of trying to pretend I was okay to the outside world so they wouldn\u2019t worry.\n5 weeks of bloodwork and doctor visits. \n5 weeks of tears and pain and feeling so bad. \n\nSo - we waited for my levels to get to non pregnant levels. I started taking folic acid. I started exercising to lose weight and making my body the healthiest I\u2019ve ever been. I did everything under the sun to try to prevent this. Maybe I just had bad luck and the third time would be the time it all works out. \n\n1 in 50 pregnancies are ectopic which is about 2% of pregnancies. I can\u2019t POSSIBLY have another one. I did the testing, my tubes are clear. We were just unlucky. \n\nWe decided we would try again in June. We didn\u2019t get pregnant. So we tried again in July. \n\nWe got our positive. I was again so thankful that we don\u2019t have the fertility problems that many couples deal with.\n\nBut - the feeling of dread came over me immediately. I think one of the shittiest things people who\u2019ve been through pregnancy loss is that we can never be truly excited about a pregnancy. There\u2019s always that feeling of terror and dread that we will once again go through the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to us. \n\nI immediately got blood work done, I got 3 blood tests done in a week as levels are supposed to double every 46 hours in a normal pregnancy.\n\nMine were looking great! But I still couldn\u2019t breathe. I still couldn\u2019t enjoy this. I was terrified. \nWe went on vacation and we had an amazing time. At the start of our vacation I did have bleeding and went to the emergency room (2 hours away from our campsite) to see if everything was okay. They couldn\u2019t see anything on the ultrasound but the gynaecologist said it was too early to see anything anyway but there was nothing obvious in my tube and to wait it out.\nWe spent the week camping and having fun. \nI still had the feeling of dread, though. I felt something was wrong but kept telling myself STATISTICALLY this pregnancy should be normal. I can\u2019t possibly have a THIRD. \nMy bloodwork continued to rise normal which isn\u2019t typical in ectopics so my doctor kept reassuring me that I was probably okay. \nI worked my weekend of nights but I couldn\u2019t settle. I went to the emergency room Monday morning where they did another scan and couldn\u2019t see anything in uterus or tubes. It was likely an unviable pregnancy and I was told it was yet another pregnancy of unknown location at this time. I left the ER but as soon as I got home I had extreme cramping and bleeding. I rushed back to the hospital. I got admitted after about 18 hours of waiting so they could monitor my pregnancy hormone and do another ultrasound on Thursday. \n\nWe were devastated. We knew this was going to be yet another loss for us. We couldn\u2019t believe it. \n\nOn Thursday the 13th of August I got my 3rd internal ultrasound which once again showed nothing anywhere. We still don\u2019t know where the pregnancy is but if it\u2019s not showing in my uterus, it\u2019s not viable and has implanted somewhere else.\nMy hormone was rising pretty good. I didn\u2019t understand. \n\nThat was today. I\u2019m writing this as I try to cope with another loss. Another let down. \nAs a woman I feel like I\u2019m letting my husband down. I feel like I can\u2019t do the one thing women are \u201csupposed\u201d to be able to naturally do. What is wrong with my body? What did I do to deserve this? \n\nI opted for surgery this time. I\u2019m waiting for them to fit me in tomorrow to go in and hope to find this pregnancy somewhere so it can be removed. \nThere is clearly something going on inside to cause these ectopics that needs to be looked at internally and hopefully fixed. \n\nI may lose one of my tubes. I may lose both of my tubes. I may lose an ovary. I may lose part of my reproductive system and I am so scared.\n\nI lost only my left tube and am recovering well \ud83d\udc9c\n\n_________________________________\n\n\n***UPDATE*******FOURTH ECTOPIC Jan 2021ec\nSo after I wrote this in august 2019 my husband and I decided to start trying again in November. We got pregnant in Jan  and got our positive on Jan 16. My hcg was rising literally textbook perfect and my doctors just kept saying \u201cbased on your 5 blood draws doubling perfectly this isn\u2019t likely ectopic.\u201d \n\nBoy were they wrong. \n\nFor the first couple weeks I felt perfectly fine. I had some mild period like cramps but like - that\u2019s normal in all pregnancies. I had no brown blood like I always have and no feeling like something was terribly wrong. \n\nThen, Tuesday the 26 (one week before I was scheduled for my placement scan) the dreaded brown flakey discharge happened. I immediately panicked. We went to the hospital where they did a scan and checked hcg level ( STILL MORE THAN DOUBLING.)\n\nThey did an ultrasound and found \u201cnothing anywhere\u201d which it what I expected at 5 weeks and hcg only being 1200. I just wanted to make sure they couldn\u2019t see something obvious in the tube. So I felt better about it and called my specialist office in the morning (Wednesday 27th) The specialist said she didn\u2019t think ectopic based on ultrasounds and hcg but to come in the next day (Thursday)  for a blood test and depending on that they\u2019d do an ultrasound. \n\nSo - I rested all day thursday and had quite a bit of pressure but I just kept calm and slept and just tried to wait it out. That night I went to the bathroom before bed and a GUSH of blood that looks like prune juice came out of me. I had no cramping. So I just went back to lay down and calm myself down. I wanted to try to just sleep it off and go to my bloodwork in morning. \n\nThat didn\u2019t work. Within minutes my entire abdomen was burning like CRAZY. I was bent over in pain and could hardly walk. My husband then rushed me to the hospital where they immediately took me to a room and pumped me full of dilaudid. \n\nI then got my second TV ultrasound within 24 hours and the radiologist found the gestational sac and yolk sac in my tube. \n\nI have another ectopic.\n\nNow - I\u2019m in hospital and the pain has passed but I\u2019m being monitored closely until I can get called for surgery. I\u2019m on the emergency list but they\u2019ve had a lot of unstable people come in so I\u2019ve been bumped. It\u2019s now Saturday at 1am as I write this. \n\nI\u2019m choosing to take out this remaining tube and move on to IVF. Keeping the tube there and doing ivf just gives me a higher change of having an IVF ectopic and I would literally have a break down if that happened so I\u2019m removing that possibility from the mix. \n\nI\u2019m devastated. I\u2019m losing my ability to conceive naturally and it breaks my heart. I just CANNOT go through another ectopic. We did everything we could in our power and it\u2019s just not working.\n\nMy fertility specialist says with me having 0 fertility problems besides my tubes my chance of Ivf working is 70% and I\u2019m happy with those odds. \n\nI\u2019m so ready to start that scary journey but I cannot wait to meet my future rainbow baby. Cause I know he or she is coming.\n\nI have hope.\n\nThank you for listening. \ud83d\udc9c", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ORIGINAL POST*****\nEctopic pregnancy was never something that came to mind when worrying about getting pregnant, I honestly didn\u2019t even really know about it until I was one of the unfortunate women that had to go through it for the first time in 2018. I always worried about fertility issues or miscarriage or still births (all absolutely horrendous situations as well) but ectopic was not even in the back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s been through this nor will I be the last. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t even put into words the gut wrenching feeling that came over me the first time I was diagnosed in June 2018. I had no idea I was pregnant for almost 2 months before I took a test (obviously I wasnt tracking my cycles at the time...oops.) literally the day after I got my positive pregnancy test I started having extreme pain. Pain that doubled me over and tears running down my face. I knew something was wrong. This first pregnancy wasn\u2019t planned but honestly, as soon as I got the positive I started planning my husband and my future with our new baby in my head. I could picture a little one with us and how our lives would be. That all got ripped away.\nI spent 5 days in the hospital with what they define as a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL.) I got countless blood tests and many ultrasounds until finally my gynaecologist diagnosed it as a non viable pregnancy. I had the option to either receive a double shot of methotrexate which is a chemotherapy drug that kills fast developing cells which ultimately ends the non viable pregnancy or I could have laparoscopic surgery. I chose methotrexate. \nAfter the shot, the pain doesn\u2019t end there. Methotrexate depletes your body of folate and makes you feel like absolute garbage in general. You have to get blood tests constantly to monitor your HCG (pregnancy hormone) to ensure the medication is in fact working. I was miserable. On top of the sickness from the medication, you still feel completely pregnant. It\u2019s extremely hard. You bleed, you pass clots and it can take a very long time for your HCG to reach non pregnant levels. The scariest part of this is that until your levels go below 5 you are still at risk of the ectopic rupturing where ever it is implanted. This is a medical emergency and you can hemorrhage and bleed out internally very quickly. You have to have someone with you 24/7 incase you rupture because the pain is usually so severe that you pass out. Luckily I have the best mother in the world who flew to Newfoundland from New Brunswick to stay with me. I couldn\u2019t work, I couldn\u2019t do housework, I couldn\u2019t do light lifting AT ALL for the risk of rupture was there.\nWith this first experience it took me almost 2 months for my hormones to reach non pregnant levels and pregnancy symptoms to subside. \nAfter your levels reach 0 you have to start taking folic acid again to replenish your body and can\u2019t start trying for another baby for 3 months as methotrexate can harm a fetus and lack of folate can cause birth defects. \nSteve and I decided not to try again until after our wedding in 2019. \nIn that time I got an HSG test done to check if my tubes were clear which is a pretty uncomfortable proceedure that they put a catheter up through and push dye through your Fallopian tubes. To my surprise and happiness - my tubes were clear and looked perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to December 2019 - we decided this was our month. We tried again and found out we were pregnant again the second week of January. I couldn\u2019t believe we got pregnant again so quick. I felt so lucky that we could get pregnant easily and we were scared but also excited. I honestly believed this would work out. About a week after finding out I was pregnant I doubled over at work, sweating and felt like I was in the worst pain of my life. I thought I was going to pass out. It\u2019s a pain I can\u2019t describe and unlike anything I\u2019ve ever felt with anything else. I knew it was ectopic again. \nI went to the hospital in the morning after work as I was on night shift. They did an ultrasound and immediately found my ectopic in my left tube. \nOnce again, I chose methotrexate. I mean, who wants to go into surgery if you can avoid it, right? \nI was able to go home from the hospital the same day with the promise that someone would be with me to monitor me 24/7. My amazing mom came once again to stay with me so that Steve could go back to work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time it took about 5 weeks for my levels to drop to 0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 weeks of feeling pregnant and knowing our child wouldn\u2019t survive.\n5 weeks of feeling like absolute death from methotrexate.\n5 weeks of emotional turmoil.\n5 weeks of wondering what I did to cause this. \n5 weeks of trying to pretend I was okay to the outside world so they wouldn\u2019t worry.\n5 weeks of bloodwork and doctor visits. \n5 weeks of tears and pain and feeling so bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So - we waited for my levels to get to non pregnant levels.

I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday to  go pee and then go soothe my 15 month old daughter and I experienced the worst pain I ever had in my life!  Left shoulder, chest pain, and severe abdominal pain, I couldn't even pick up my daughter to soothe her It was terrible. Even worse my husband just had an emergency appendix surgery five days prior so he couldn't even help.  \n\nOnce I  got to the hospital I had a bunch of tests done, once they came back they told me I was pregnant I felt excited and scared because we never really talked much about when to try again. But I was also confused to why, I just had a period, and why I was still bleeding plus we used protection except that one time. Things didn't add up in my head. So some further testing they seen it was an ectopic pregnancy and my fallopian tube has ruptured. I can't explain the mixed emotions I experienced, going from such a high to a low in a matter of an hour sucked. I haven't cried that much in years.\n\nThe nurses were so supportive, but I was still so alone, especially with covid,my local hospital has no visitation so I was even more alone.  Once the gynecologist came in to talk about options I  was even more lost in my emotions. My opinions were surgery well who is going to pick up my daughter and help her because my husband cant! or the methotrexate shot. So I took the shot. \n\nI have to do blood work 3 times after receiving it, first one no change, the second my HCG has increased  by double, and I go for my third Tuesday, So far its not looking good. looks like surgery is in my future.

I always worried about fertility issues or miscarriage or still births (all absolutely horrendous situations as well) but ectopic was not even in the back of my mind.\n\nI know I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s been through this nor will I be the last. \n\nI can\u2019t even put into words the gut wrenching feeling that came over me the first time I was diagnosed in June 2018. I had no idea I was pregnant for almost 2 months before I took a test (obviously I wasnt tracking my cycles at the time...oops.) literally the day after I got my positive pregnancy test I started having extreme pain. Pain that doubled me over and tears running down my face. I knew something was wrong. This first pregnancy wasn\u2019t planned but honestly, as soon as I got the positive I started planning my husband and my future with our new baby in my head. I could picture a little one with us and how our lives would be. That all got ripped away.\nI spent 5 days in the hospital with what they define as a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL.) I got countless blood tests and many ultrasounds until finally my gynaecologist diagnosed it as a non viable pregnancy. I had the option to either receive a double shot of methotrexate which is a chemotherapy drug that kills fast developing cells which ultimately ends the non viable pregnancy or I could have laparoscopic surgery. I chose methotrexate. \nAfter the shot, the pain doesn\u2019t end there. Methotrexate depletes your body of folate and makes you feel like absolute garbage in general. You have to get blood tests constantly to monitor your HCG (pregnancy hormone) to ensure the medication is in fact working. I was miserable. On top of the sickness from the medication, you still feel completely pregnant. It\u2019s extremely hard. You bleed, you pass clots and it can take a very long time for your HCG to reach non pregnant levels. The scariest part of this is that until your levels go below 5 you are still at risk of the ectopic rupturing where ever it is implanted. This is a medical emergency and you can hemorrhage and bleed out internally very quickly. You have to have someone with you 24/7 incase you rupture because the pain is usually so severe that you pass out. Luckily I have the best mother in the world who flew to Newfoundland from New Brunswick to stay with me. I couldn\u2019t work, I couldn\u2019t do housework, I couldn\u2019t do light lifting AT ALL for the risk of rupture was there.\nWith this first experience it took me almost 2 months for my hormones to reach non pregnant levels and pregnancy symptoms to subside. \nAfter your levels reach 0 you have to start taking folic acid again to replenish your body and can\u2019t start trying for another baby for 3 months as methotrexate can harm a fetus and lack of folate can cause birth defects. \nSteve and I decided not to try again until after our wedding in 2019. \nIn that time I got an HSG test done to check if my tubes were clear which is a pretty uncomfortable proceedure that they put a catheter up through and push dye through your Fallopian tubes. To my surprise and happiness - my tubes were clear and looked perfect.\n\nFlash forward to December 2019 - we decided this was our month. We tried again and found out we were pregnant again the second week of January. I couldn\u2019t believe we got pregnant again so quick. I felt so lucky that we could get pregnant easily and we were scared but also excited. I honestly believed this would work out. About a week after finding out I was pregnant I doubled over at work, sweating and felt like I was in the worst pain of my life. I thought I was going to pass out. It\u2019s a pain I can\u2019t describe and unlike anything I\u2019ve ever felt with anything else. I knew it was ectopic again. \nI went to the hospital in the morning after work as I was on night shift. They did an ultrasound and immediately found my ectopic in my left tube. \nOnce again, I chose methotrexate. I mean, who wants to go into surgery if you can avoid it, right? \nI was able to go home from the hospital the same day with the promise that someone would be with me to monitor me 24/7. My amazing mom came once again to stay with me so that Steve could go back to work. \n\nThis time it took about 5 weeks for my levels to drop to 0.\n\n5 weeks of feeling pregnant and knowing our child wouldn\u2019t survive.\n5 weeks of feeling like absolute death from methotrexate.\n5 weeks of emotional turmoil.\n5 weeks of wondering what I did to cause this. \n5 weeks of trying to pretend I was okay to the outside world so they wouldn\u2019t worry.\n5 weeks of bloodwork and doctor visits. \n5 weeks of tears and pain and feeling so bad. \n\nSo - we waited for my levels to get to non pregnant levels. I started taking folic acid. I started exercising to lose weight and making my body the healthiest I\u2019ve ever been. I did everything under the sun to try to prevent this. Maybe I just had bad luck and the third time would be the time it all works out. \n\n1 in 50 pregnancies are ectopic which is about 2% of pregnancies. I can\u2019t POSSIBLY have another one. I did the testing, my tubes are clear. We were just unlucky. \n\nWe decided we would try again in June. We didn\u2019t get pregnant. So we tried again in July. \n\nWe got our positive. I was again so thankful that we don\u2019t have the fertility problems that many couples deal with.\n\nBut - the feeling of dread came over me immediately. I think one of the shittiest things people who\u2019ve been through pregnancy loss is that we can never be truly excited about a pregnancy. There\u2019s always that feeling of terror and dread that we will once again go through the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to us. \n\nI immediately got blood work done, I got 3 blood tests done in a week as levels are supposed to double every 46 hours in a normal pregnancy.\n\nMine were looking great! But I still couldn\u2019t breathe. I still couldn\u2019t enjoy this. I was terrified. \nWe went on vacation and we had an amazing time. At the start of our vacation I did have bleeding and went to the emergency room (2 hours away from our campsite) to see if everything was okay. They couldn\u2019t see anything on the ultrasound but the gynaecologist said it was too early to see anything anyway but there was nothing obvious in my tube and to wait it out.\nWe spent the week camping and having fun. \nI still had the feeling of dread, though. I felt something was wrong but kept telling myself STATISTICALLY this pregnancy should be normal. I can\u2019t possibly have a THIRD. \nMy bloodwork continued to rise normal which isn\u2019t typical in ectopics so my doctor kept reassuring me that I was probably okay. \nI worked my weekend of nights but I couldn\u2019t settle. I went to the emergency room Monday morning where they did another scan and couldn\u2019t see anything in uterus or tubes. It was likely an unviable pregnancy and I was told it was yet another pregnancy of unknown location at this time. I left the ER but as soon as I got home I had extreme cramping and bleeding. I rushed back to the hospital. I got admitted after about 18 hours of waiting so they could monitor my pregnancy hormone and do another ultrasound on Thursday. \n\nWe were devastated. We knew this was going to be yet another loss for us. We couldn\u2019t believe it. \n\nOn Thursday the 13th of August I got my 3rd internal ultrasound which once again showed nothing anywhere. We still don\u2019t know where the pregnancy is but if it\u2019s not showing in my uterus, it\u2019s not viable and has implanted somewhere else.\nMy hormone was rising pretty good. I didn\u2019t understand. \n\nThat was today. I\u2019m writing this as I try to cope with another loss. Another let down. \nAs a woman I feel like I\u2019m letting my husband down. I feel like I can\u2019t do the one thing women are \u201csupposed\u201d to be able to naturally do. What is wrong with my body? What did I do to deserve this? \n\nI opted for surgery this time. I\u2019m waiting for them to fit me in tomorrow to go in and hope to find this pregnancy somewhere so it can be removed. \nThere is clearly something going on inside to cause these ectopics that needs to be looked at internally and hopefully fixed. \n\nI may lose one of my tubes. I may lose both of my tubes. I may lose an ovary. I may lose part of my reproductive system and I am so scared.\n\nI lost only my left tube and am recovering well \ud83d\udc9c\n\n_________________________________\n\n\n***UPDATE*******FOURTH ECTOPIC Jan 2021ec\nSo after I wrote this in august 2019 my husband and I decided to start trying again in November. We got pregnant in Jan  and got our positive on Jan 16. My hcg was rising literally textbook perfect and my doctors just kept saying \u201cbased on your 5 blood draws doubling perfectly this isn\u2019t likely ectopic.\u201d \n\nBoy were they wrong. \n\nFor the first couple weeks I felt perfectly fine. I had some mild period like cramps but like - that\u2019s normal in all pregnancies. I had no brown blood like I always have and no feeling like something was terribly wrong. \n\nThen, Tuesday the 26 (one week before I was scheduled for my placement scan) the dreaded brown flakey discharge happened. I immediately panicked. We went to the hospital where they did a scan and checked hcg level ( STILL MORE THAN DOUBLING.)\n\nThey did an ultrasound and found \u201cnothing anywhere\u201d which it what I expected at 5 weeks and hcg only being 1200. I just wanted to make sure they couldn\u2019t see something obvious in the tube. So I felt better about it and called my specialist office in the morning (Wednesday 27th) The specialist said she didn\u2019t think ectopic based on ultrasounds and hcg but to come in the next day (Thursday)  for a blood test and depending on that they\u2019d do an ultrasound. \n\nSo - I rested all day thursday and had quite a bit of pressure but I just kept calm and slept and just tried to wait it out. That night I went to the bathroom before bed and a GUSH of blood came out of me. I had no cramping. So I just went back to lay down and calm myself down.

I had no idea I was pregnant for almost 2 months before I took a test (obviously I wasnt tracking my cycles at the time...oops.) literally the day after I got my positive pregnancy test I started having extreme pain. Pain that doubled me over and tears running down my face. I knew something was wrong. This first pregnancy wasn\u2019t planned but honestly, as soon as I got the positive I started planning my husband and my future with our new baby in my head. I could picture a little one with us and how our lives would be. That all got ripped away.\nI spent 5 days in the hospital with what they define as a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL.) I got countless blood tests and many ultrasounds until finally my gynaecologist diagnosed it as a non viable pregnancy. I had the option to either receive a double shot of methotrexate which is a chemotherapy drug that kills fast developing cells which ultimately ends the non viable pregnancy or I could have laparoscopic surgery. I chose methotrexate. \nAfter the shot, the pain doesn\u2019t end there. Methotrexate depletes your body of folate and makes you feel like absolute garbage in general. You have to get blood tests constantly to monitor your HCG (pregnancy hormone) to ensure the medication is in fact working. I was miserable. On top of the sickness from the medication, you still feel completely pregnant. It\u2019s extremely hard.

To my surprise and happiness - my tubes were clear and looked perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to December 2019 - we decided this was our month. We tried again and found out we were pregnant again the second week of January. I couldn\u2019t believe we got pregnant again so quick. I felt so lucky that we could get pregnant easily and we were scared but also excited. I honestly believed this would work out. About a week after finding out I was pregnant I doubled over at work, sweating and felt like I was in the worst pain of my life. I thought I was going to pass out. It\u2019s a pain I can\u2019t describe and unlike anything I\u2019ve ever felt with anything else. I knew it was ectopic again. \nI went to the hospital in the morning after work as I was on night shift. They did an ultrasound and immediately found my ectopic in my left tube. \nOnce again, I chose methotrexate. I mean, who wants to go into surgery if you can avoid it, right? \nI was able to go home from the hospital the same day with the promise that someone would be with me to monitor me 24/7. My amazing mom came once again to stay with me so that Steve could go back to work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time it took about 5 weeks for my levels to drop to 0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 weeks of feeling pregnant and knowing our child wouldn\u2019t survive.\n5 weeks of feeling like absolute death from methotrexate.\n5 weeks of emotional turmoil.\n5 weeks of wondering what I did to cause this. \n5 weeks of trying to pretend I was okay to the outside world so they wouldn\u2019t worry.\n5 weeks of bloodwork and doctor visits. \n5 weeks of tears and pain and feeling so bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So - we waited for my levels to get to non pregnant levels. I started taking folic acid. I started exercising to lose weight and making my body the healthiest I\u2019ve ever been. I did everything under the sun to try to prevent this. Maybe I just had bad luck and the third time would be the time it all works out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 in 50 pregnancies are ectopic which is about 2% of pregnancies. I can\u2019t POSSIBLY have another one. I did the testing, my tubes are clear. We were just unlucky. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decided we would try again in June. We didn\u2019t get pregnant. So we tried again in July. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got our positive. I was again so thankful that we don\u2019t have the fertility problems that many couples deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But - the feeling of dread came over me immediately. I think one of the shittiest things people who\u2019ve been through pregnancy loss is that we can never be truly excited about a pregnancy. There\u2019s always that feeling of terror and dread that we will once again go through the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I immediately got blood work done, I got 3 blood tests done in a week as levels are supposed to double every 46 hours in a normal pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mine were looking great! But I still couldn\u2019t breathe. I still couldn\u2019t enjoy this. I was terrified. \nWe went on vacation and we had an amazing time. At the start of our vacation I did have bleeding and went to the emergency room (2 hours away from our campsite) to see if everything was okay. They couldn\u2019t see anything on the ultrasound but the gynaecologist said it was too early to see anything anyway but there was nothing obvious in my tube and to wait it out.\nWe spent the week camping and having fun. \nI still had the feeling of dread, though. I felt something was wrong but kept telling myself STATISTICALLY this pregnancy should be normal. I can\u2019t possibly have a THIRD. \nMy bloodwork continued to rise normal which isn\u2019t typical in ectopics so my doctor kept reassuring me that I was probably okay. \nI worked my weekend of nights but I couldn\u2019t settle. I went to the emergency room Monday morning where they did another scan and couldn\u2019t see anything in uterus or tubes. It was likely an unviable pregnancy and I was told it was yet another pregnancy of unknown location at this time. I left the ER but as soon as I got home I had extreme cramping and bleeding. I rushed back to the hospital. I got admitted after about 18 hours of waiting so they could monitor my pregnancy hormone and do another ultrasound on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were devastated. We knew this was going to be yet another loss for us. We couldn\u2019t believe it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the 13th of August I got my 3rd internal ultrasound which once again showed nothing anywhere. We still don\u2019t know where the pregnancy is but if it\u2019s not showing in my uterus, it\u2019s not viable and has implanted somewhere else.\nMy hormone was rising pretty good. I didn\u2019t understand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was today. I\u2019m writing this as I try to cope with another loss. Another let down. \nAs a woman I feel like I\u2019m letting my husband down. I feel like I can\u2019t do the one thing women are \u201csupposed\u201d to be able to naturally do. What is wrong with my body? What did I do to deserve this? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opted for surgery this time. I\u2019m waiting for them to fit me in tomorrow to go in and hope to find this pregnancy somewhere so it can be removed. \nThere is clearly something going on inside to cause these ectopics that needs to be looked at internally and hopefully fixed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I may lose one of my tubes. I may lose both of my tubes. I may lose an ovary. I may lose part of my reproductive system and I am so scared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lost only my left tube and am recovering well \ud83d\udc9c&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;****FOURTH ECTOPIC Jan 2021ec\nSo after I wrote this in august 2019 my husband and I decided to start trying again in November. We got pregnant in Jan  and got our positive on Jan 16. My hcg was rising literally textbook perfect and my doctors just kept saying \u201cbased on your 5 blood draws doubling perfectly this isn\u2019t likely ectopic.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boy were they wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first couple weeks I felt perfectly fine. I had some mild period like cramps but like - that\u2019s normal in all pregnancies. I had no brown blood like I always have and no feeling like something was terribly wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, Tuesday the 26 (one week before I was scheduled for my placement scan) the dreaded brown flakey discharge happened. I immediately panicked. We went to the hospital where they did a scan and checked hcg level ( STILL MORE THAN DOUBLING.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They did an ultrasound and found \u201cnothing anywhere\u201d which it what I expected at 5 weeks and hcg only being 1200. I just wanted to make sure they couldn\u2019t see something obvious in the tube. So I felt better about it and called my specialist office in the morning (Wednesday 27th) The specialist said she didn\u2019t think ectopic based on ultrasounds and hcg but to come in the next day (Thursday)  for a blood test and depending on that they\u2019d do an ultrasound. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So - I rested all day thursday and had quite a bit of pressure but I just kept calm and slept and just tried to wait it out. That night I went to the bathroom before bed and a GUSH of blood came out of me. I had no cramping. So I just went back to lay down and calm myself down. I wanted to try to just sleep it off and go to my bloodwork in morning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That didn\u2019t work. Within minutes my entire abdomen was burning like CRAZY. I was bent over in pain and could hardly walk. My husband then rushed me to the hospital where they immediately took me to a room and pumped me full of dilaudid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then got my second TV ultrasound within 24 hours and the radiologist found the gestational sac and yolk sac in my tube. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have another ectopic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now - I\u2019m in hospital and the pain has passed but I\u2019m being monitored closely until I can get called for surgery. I\u2019m on the emergency list but they\u2019ve had a lot of unstable people come in so I\u2019ve been bumped. It\u2019s now Saturday at 1am as I write this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m choosing to take out this remaining tube and move on to IVF.

I started taking folic acid. I started exercising to lose weight and making my body the healthiest I\u2019ve ever been. I did everything under the sun to try to prevent this. Maybe I just had bad luck and the third time would be the time it all works out. \n\n1 in 50 pregnancies are ectopic which is about 2% of pregnancies. I can\u2019t POSSIBLY have another one. I did the testing, my tubes are clear. We were just unlucky. \n\nWe decided we would try again in June. We didn\u2019t get pregnant. So we tried again in July. \n\nWe got our positive. I was again so thankful that we don\u2019t have the fertility problems that many couples deal with.\n\nBut - the feeling of dread came over me immediately. I think one of the shittiest things people who\u2019ve been through pregnancy loss is that we can never be truly excited about a pregnancy. There\u2019s always that feeling of terror and dread that we will once again go through the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to us. \n\nI immediately got blood work done, I got 3 blood tests done in a week as levels are supposed to double every 46 hours in a normal pregnancy.\n\nMine were looking great! But I still couldn\u2019t breathe. I still couldn\u2019t enjoy this. I was terrified. \nWe went on vacation and we had an amazing time. At the start of our vacation I did have bleeding and went to the emergency room (2 hours away from our campsite) to see if everything was okay. They couldn\u2019t see anything on the ultrasound but the gynaecologist said it was too early to see anything anyway but there was nothing obvious in my tube and to wait it out.\nWe spent the week camping and having fun. \nI still had the feeling of dread, though. I felt something was wrong but kept telling myself STATISTICALLY this pregnancy should be normal. I can\u2019t possibly have a THIRD. \nMy bloodwork continued to rise normal which isn\u2019t typical in ectopics so my doctor kept reassuring me that I was probably okay. \nI worked my weekend of nights but I couldn\u2019t settle. I went to the emergency room Monday morning where they did another scan and couldn\u2019t see anything in uterus or tubes. It was likely an unviable pregnancy and I was told it was yet another pregnancy of unknown location at this time. I left the ER but as soon as I got home I had extreme cramping and bleeding. I rushed back to the hospital. I got admitted after about 18 hours of waiting so they could monitor my pregnancy hormone and do another ultrasound on Thursday. \n\nWe were devastated. We knew this was going to be yet another loss for us. We couldn\u2019t believe it. \n\nOn Thursday the 13th of August I got my 3rd internal ultrasound which once again showed nothing anywhere. We still don\u2019t know where the pregnancy is but if it\u2019s not showing in my uterus, it\u2019s not viable and has implanted somewhere else.\nMy hormone was rising pretty good. I didn\u2019t understand. \n\nThat was today. I\u2019m writing this as I try to cope with another loss. Another let down. \nAs a woman I feel like I\u2019m letting my husband down. I feel like I can\u2019t do the one thing women are \u201csupposed\u201d to be able to naturally do. What is wrong with my body? What did I do to deserve this? \n\nI opted for surgery this time. I\u2019m waiting for them to fit me in tomorrow to go in and hope to find this pregnancy somewhere so it can be removed. \nThere is clearly something going on inside to cause these ectopics that needs to be looked at internally and hopefully fixed. \n\nI may lose one of my tubes. I may lose both of my tubes. I may lose an ovary. I may lose part of my reproductive system and I am so scared.", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;****FOURTH ECTOPIC\nSo after I wrote this in august 2019 my husband and I decided to start trying again in November. We got pregnant in Jan  and got our positive on Jan 16. My hcg was rising literally textbook perfect and my doctors just kept saying \u201cbased on your 5 blood draws doubling perfectly this isn\u2019t likely ectopic.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boy were they wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first couple weeks I felt perfectly fine. I had some mild period like cramps but like - that\u2019s normal in all pregnancies. I had no brown blood like I always have and no feeling like something was terribly wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, Tuesday the 26 (one week before I was scheduled for my placement scan) the dreaded brown flakey discharge happened. I immediately panicked. We went to the hospital where they did a scan and checked hcg level ( STILL MORE THAN DOUBLING.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They did an ultrasound and found \u201cnothing anywhere\u201d which it what I expected at 5 weeks and hcg only being 1200. I just wanted to make sure they couldn\u2019t see something obvious in the tube. So I felt better about it and called my specialist office in the morning (Wednesday 27th) The specialist said she didn\u2019t think ectopic based on ultrasounds and hcg but to come in the next day (Thursday)  for a blood test and depending on that they\u2019d do an ultrasound. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So - I rested all day thursday and had quite a bit of pressure but I just kept calm and slept and just tried to wait it out. That night I went to the bathroom before bed and a GUSH of blood came out of me. I had no cramping. So I just went back to lay down and calm myself down. I wanted to try to just sleep it off and go to my bloodwork in morning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That didn\u2019t work. Within minutes my entire abdomen was burning like CRAZY. I was bent over in pain and could hardly walk. My husband then rushed me to the hospital where they immediately took me to a room and pumped me full of dilaudid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then got my second TV ultrasound within 24 hours and the radiologist found the gestational sac and yolk sac in my tube. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have another ectopic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now - I\u2019m in hospital and the pain has passed but I\u2019m being monitored closely until I can get called for surgery. I\u2019m on the emergency list but they\u2019ve had a lot of unstable people come in so I\u2019ve been bumped. It\u2019s now Saturday at 1am as I write this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m choosing to take out this remaining tube and move on to IVF. Keeping the tube there and doing ivf just gives me a higher change of having an IVF ectopic and I would literally have a break down if that happened so I\u2019m removing that possibility from the mix. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m devastated. I\u2019m losing my ability to conceive naturally and it breaks my heart. I just CANNOT go through another ectopic. We did everything we could in our power and it\u2019s just not working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My fertility specialist says with me having 0 fertility problems besides my tubes my chance of Ivf working is 70% and I\u2019m happy with those odds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m so ready to start that scary journey but I cannot wait to meet my future rainbow baby. Cause I know he or she is coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening. \ud83d\udc9c&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ORIGINAL POST*****\nEctopic pregnancy was never something that came to mind when worrying about getting pregnant, I honestly didn\u2019t even really know about it until I was one of the unfortunate women that had to go through it for the first time in 2018. I always worried about fertility issues or miscarriage or still births (all absolutely horrendous situations as well) but ectopic was not even in the back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s been through this nor will I be the last. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t even put into words the gut wrenching feeling that came over me the first time I was diagnosed in June 2018. I had no idea I was pregnant for almost 2 months before I took a test (obviously I wasnt tracking my cycles at the time...oops.) literally the day after I got my positive pregnancy test I started having extreme pain. Pain that doubled me over and tears running down my face. I knew something was wrong. This first pregnancy wasn\u2019t planned but honestly, as soon as I got the positive I started planning my husband and my future with our new baby in my head. I could picture a little one with us and how our lives would be. That all got ripped away.\nI spent 5 days in the hospital with what they define as a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL.) I got countless blood tests and many ultrasounds until finally my gynaecologist diagnosed it as a non viable pregnancy. I had the option to either receive a double shot of methotrexate which is a chemotherapy drug that kills fast developing cells which ultimately ends the non viable pregnancy or I could have laparoscopic surgery. I chose methotrexate. \nAfter the shot, the pain doesn\u2019t end there. Methotrexate depletes your body of folate and makes you feel like absolute garbage in general. You have to get blood tests constantly to monitor your HCG (pregnancy hormone) to ensure the medication is in fact working. I was miserable. On top of the sickness from the medication, you still feel completely pregnant. It\u2019s extremely hard. You bleed, you pass clots and it can take a very long time for your HCG to reach non pregnant levels. The scariest part of this is that until your levels go below 5 you are still at risk of the ectopic rupturing where ever it is implanted. This is a medical emergency and you can hemorrhage and bleed out internally very quickly. You have to have someone with you 24/7 incase you rupture because the pain is usually so severe that you pass out. Luckily I have the best mother in the world who flew to Newfoundland from New Brunswick to stay with me. I couldn\u2019t work, I couldn\u2019t do housework, I couldn\u2019t do light lifting AT ALL for the risk of rupture was there.\nWith this first experience it took me almost 2 months for my hormones to reach non pregnant levels and pregnancy symptoms to subside. \nAfter your levels reach 0 you have to start taking folic acid again to replenish your body and can\u2019t start trying for another baby for 3 months as methotrexate can harm a fetus and lack of folate can cause birth defects. \nSteve and I decided not to try again until after our wedding in 2019. \nIn that time I got an HSG test done to check if my tubes were clear which is a pretty uncomfortable proceedure that they put a catheter up through and push dye through your Fallopian tubes. To my surprise and happiness - my tubes were clear and looked perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to December 2019 - we decided this was our month. We tried again and found out we were pregnant again the second week of January. I couldn\u2019t believe we got pregnant again so quick. I felt so lucky that we could get pregnant easily and we were scared but also excited. I honestly believed this would work out. About a week after finding out I was pregnant I doubled over at work, sweating and felt like I was in the worst pain of my life. I thought I was going to pass out. It\u2019s a pain I can\u2019t describe and unlike anything I\u2019ve ever felt with anything else. I knew it was ectopic again. \nI went to the hospital in the morning after work as I was on night shift. They did an ultrasound and immediately found my ectopic in my left tube. \nOnce again, I chose methotrexate. I mean, who wants to go into surgery if you can avoid it, right? \nI was able to go home from the hospital the same day with the promise that someone would be with me to monitor me 24/7. My amazing mom came once again to stay with me so that Steve could go back to work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time it took about 5 weeks for my levels to drop to 0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 weeks of feeling pregnant and knowing our child wouldn\u2019t survive.\n5 weeks of feeling like absolute death from methotrexate.\n5 weeks of emotional turmoil.\n5 weeks of wondering what I did to cause this. \n5 weeks of trying to pretend I was okay to the outside world so they wouldn\u2019t worry.\n5 weeks of bloodwork and doctor visits. \n5 weeks of tears and pain and feeling so bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So - we waited for my levels to get to non pregnant levels. I started taking folic acid. I started exercising to lose weight and making my body the healthiest I\u2019ve ever been. I did everything under the sun to try to prevent this.

After suffering a blighted ovum in August, I didnt expect this. \n\nSo Saturday night I get the darkest BFP ever. Strange because its too early this cycle but I had a feeling about the light spotting. Sunday night hubby and I start feeling maybe we got food poisoning. He just has a bit of an upset stomach, Im vomitting and shivering all night with a lower right abdominal pain. First thing the next morning I run to my OBs office but she isnt in yet. Her staff assures me nausea and some light cramp with spotting can be normal. Do a urine test and congratulated me on my positive test. By this time my pain is just slight discomfort and they book the soonest apt on Thursday. I go home and feel like crap for a few hours. The right side pain comes back and I just run to the ER. Mri, ultrasounds, blood work. Rulled out appendicitis and gallbladder. They see a small mass by my right ovary not sure what it is. No sign of baby in uterus. Based on hcg 639 they say its too early to see any sign of baby. Since my pain isnt too bad now they say I should follow up with blood and ultrasound in 48 hours.\n\n40 hours later, (and my 32nd birthday) I leave work early and go straight to the hospital. Get blood and ultrasound again. Now hcg is 905. Again the same convo. Doc isnt sure if its ectopic or little baby is too small to detect and the thing by ovary could possibly be something else. They bring their on call OBGYN to talk to me. She says she doesnt want to give me too much hope. But she has seen viable pregnancies from slow rising hcg. And the fact that I didnt wait full 48 hours cant say for sure if it would have doubled. The docs call my OBGYN to consult. I dont hear the convo. Then the hospital OB pushed around my tummy and I did not have severe pain. She asked family history then decided to not do the pelvic exam she had planned on since I had an appointment with my OB the next day. \n\nThe next morning I wake up feeling fine. Maybe 40 minutes later a wave of nausea and now my discomfort is more like a period cramp and in the center and tender to the touch. I call my OB office and ask for an earlier apt. They say if I come in they will try to see me sooner. As I prepare to leave I first walk my dogs. I make it 30 feet before I feel like Im going to black out. I quickly drag them back inside where I collapse. I call my husband and tell him he needs to drive me because I cant now. We get the the office, I pee in the cup and as I'm walking to the exam room I faint again. Now my doctor is checking me and tells me to go straight to the ER where shes calling ahead for her tests. An hour later Im in the operating room have my ruptured tube removed along with over a litre of blood removed from my abdomen. My OB met me at the hospital and performed the surgery. She said she couldnt believe the amount of blood, hours away from possibly being fatal. She also said she couldnt believe the ER the night before discharged me. Apparently when they called her, she suggested keeping me in and giving me the methotrexate shot to stop the developing pregnancy. How could they not tell me?!?\n\nI am distraught. I am in pain.

Since then, of course, this dream turned into a protracted nightmare of bleeding and pain, deep uncertainty, USs, scary covid-era doc visits, an ectopic diagnosis, MTX, meltdowns, obsession with folic acid, and now, what feels like an endless, extremely high-risk wait-and-see game. \n\nI was just watching the news this eve and a woman featured in one news story (about social-distancing thanksgiving celebrations) said that she and her husband are expecting their first child and are excited to tell their family on a thanksgiving zoom call. Hearing that made me lose it. This all just feels so so damn heart-wrenching and confusing and unfair.\n\nI know there is a lot to be grateful at this moment\u2014-personally, we caught things early and I\u2019m alive\u2014-and I\u2019m trying to focus on that.

And I\u2019m thinking of you.\n\nFinally, I read this passage today and it resonated and somehow seemed to validate my feelings of grief and loss:\n\n\u2018This gratitude is a powerful antidote to a system that tells you are never enough or have enough.

But it is not enough to weep for our lost landscapes; we have to put our hands in the earth to make ourselves whole again. Even a wounded world is feeding us.

I took a pregnancy test and it was a very faint positive. I made an appointment with my ob-gyn and I was not able to get there because I started bleeding last week. I had an appointment that Friday (11.13) however, I went to the hospital on Tuesday (11.10).\n\n I started bleeding and immediately thought I was having a miscarriage because it was dark red.  They did a few tests and considered my pregnancy a \"threatened\" one. The hCG levels last week was 18. Since I am early, they could not see anything on the ultrasound. I bled from Tuesday (11.10)-Friday(11.13).\n\nI get my blood yesterday, and my level is 280. This is 6 days later. My last period was 10.04. So I should be around 7 weeks and my level is nowhere near 7k. Could I be having an ectopic pregnancy? Or, is there a glimmer of hope? I have to go back next week to check out my blood level and the wait is going to kill me. I had two miscarriages prior to what I am waiting for now so it is very depressing.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ectopicpregnancy", "subreddit_id": "t5_3flb7", "subreddit_subscribers": 234, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "ectopic pregnancy coming?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/jw6ztq/ectopic_pregnancy_coming/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "rrrrrrachelll", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3gbfgi7b", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605494370, "domain": "self.ectopicpregnancy", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/juyxs6/increasing_hcg_level/", "gildings": {}, "id": "juyxs6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ectopicpregnancy/comments/juyxs6/increasing_hcg_level/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1605549667, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was diagnosed with ectopic 11/9 and got my first methotrexate shot.
