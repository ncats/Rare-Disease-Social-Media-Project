Every doctor I see doesn\u2019t  know what\u2019s wrong, chalks it up to anxiety, and to rest. \n\n\nI\u2019ve recently been having these \u2018episodes\u2019 of sudden, severe weakness, sometimes full blown paralysis, where it\u2019s difficult to control my limbs. I get confusion and numbness/ pins and needles, dizziness and lightheaded. I\u2019ve noticed they occur after I\u2019ve sat down after doing light exercise. (E.g. waking around the shops, racing up and down the stairs to grab my son a bottle during the night) I\u2019m too scared to attempt more heavier exercise to see if it worsens tbh. \n\n\nThey sometimes last 10 mins, other times, for hours. I\u2019ve been to the emergency room but by the time a doctor sees me all my symptoms are gone. I\u2019m really dizzy, lightheaded and weak but can move fine, respond well and they send me home. \n\n\nWhen I\u2019m having an episode sometimes I can like fight it? If I sit up and continue moving it can reduce how bad it is or if I lie down and try and stay still they worsen. (Sorry don\u2019t know if that makes sense) \n\n\nI\u2019ve had an MRI, ECG and blood work to check hemoglobin and iron levels and I\u2019m told they\u2019re all fine.   \n\n\nI\u2019m desperate to find out what\u2019s wrong because they absolutely terrify me. I think that I\u2019m dying during the bad ones. And I\u2019m the sole caretaker of a baby (family and friends live on the other side of the country) so I\u2019m terrified to have a bad one while I\u2019m looking after him. \n\n\nDoctors say they can\u2019t find anything wrong with me. \n\n\nI\u2019ve read that periodic paralysis is genetic, but I\u2019ve never heard of anyone in my family experiencing these. \n\n\nPlease let me know if you\u2019re symptoms are similar. I want to tell my doctor that I want to do tests for periodic paralysis as I can\u2019t find another explanation for my symptoms but don\u2019t want to waste her time or come off as me telling her how to be a doctor, ya know? \n\n\n\nTl;dr episodes of numbness and severe weakness- sometimes paralysis, in all limbs. lasting between 10 mins to ~6 hours. They occur when sitting down just after light exercise.

Sorry for the wall of text.\n\nI was diagnosed with familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis 5 years ago, but I have been dealing with the symptoms since my teen years.\n\nNot really sure if my flair is right. My mother has breathing and cardiac problems, and also a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, so we 'assume' there's a mutation in the sodium channel gene. Just clearing that up. I don't know which gene might be.\n\nBefore getting the diagnosis, my mother struggled with panic attacks and chronic insomnia. She got better after taking potassium supplements.\n\nAs for myself, my main symptoms when not taking potassium are daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. I have only had 3/4 drop attacks in my life.\n\nI have been suffering from weird episodes of suicidal ideation, mildly paranoid thoughts, depression, agitation, irritability, etc for a few years now. When they are over, I'm puzzled as to why I felt that way. I don't remember the feeling but I remember experiencing it. These happen before or during my period.\n\nThese mood changes seem to appear when I'm not taking potassium as needed, or whenever I have a sudden drop of potassium. I think I get better after increasing my intake but I'm not sure yet.\n\nI also have a lot of cognitive problems during them, I can't concentrate like usual, easily distracted, sounds are too loud, etc. I'm not like this when I'm normal except for the cognitive problems that last longer to fade. These mood episodes are very extreme and they seem to be triggered by stress.\n\nI'm asking this question because two weeks ago, I had sleep paralysis with hypnagogic hallucinations and a few days after that, I had a really bad mood change that came in waves and then dissapeared. In between those waves, I was stressed but I didn't felt suicidal at all.\n\n\nDoes anyone experience something like this?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit":

Since 2015 I've been having episodic bouts of severe, sudden weakness and paralysis that has been continuously brushed off as anxiety/psychological, attention seeking, etc. I can never seem to get a doctor to take it seriously even though I have had paralysis post-op, during PT, in the ER (to the point my husband and nurses or the security guard have had to carry me), and weakness during doctor's appointments.\n\nMy neurologist insists it's an essential tremor and that I should get enough sleep and reduce stress. But essential tremor just doesn't seem to fit the bill...\n\nOver time I have noticed one standout pattern: I get weak immediately after exercise when I stop moving. I can keep going as long as I don't stop (if my other health problems aren't stopping me), but as soon as I stop I get all tremulous and weak and my limbs don't move quite as I intend. If it's especially bad I just sort of fold into the ground.\n\nOther times I get completely limp. This is usually when I am very sick (I have Gi issues, migraine, and IST), having tachycardia, startled, post-op, or some random times I have no idea why. I just cannot move. I feel suddenly very tired and within a minute or two I am a ragdoll. Usually this ends in my sleep or in the hospital with an IV, once with POTASSIUM, so I don't know how long it lasts.\n\nAnyway, as it's been so persistent I kept searching for what causes weaknesses after exercises and always come back to hypokalemic periodic paralysis. I don't want to seem like a loony \"google doctor,\" but doing my own research was the only way I got anywhere with my health problems . . . and this is uncannily similar to my situation . . . I'm hoping for advice or other people's experiences, maybe just some hope. I'm completely disabled by my combined conditions, I've gone through 8 jobs, but I feel like my doctors still think I'm making this up or making a big deal because I can't show them at will.   \nI just can't find any other explanation . . . I've had an MRI to rule out MS.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PeriodicParalysis", "subreddit_id": "t5_tsvd0", "subreddit_subscribers": 63, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I think I have periodic paralysis . . .", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PeriodicParalysis/comments/lmfqyw/i_think_i_have_periodic_paralysis/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Fluffy-Bluebird", "author_flair_background_color": "#eeeeff", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "99fd7b2e-0d71-11e9-9f84-0e82cc4f8510", "author_flair_text": "undx", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5juqzf9g", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1613351096, "domain": "self.PeriodicParalysis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PeriodicParalysis/comments/lk2111/prodromes_warnings_signs/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lk2111", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#967db4", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "9adf3af6-0d57-11e9-a24b-0e06c4850e3c", "link_flair_text": "question", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/PeriodicParalysis/comments/lk2111/prodromes_warnings_signs/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1613351107, "score": 1, "selftext": "What are y\u2019all\u2019s prodromes for attacks?

My symptoms came on after a shoulder surgery. \n\nMine have hit arms, legs, and full body. \n\nCommon factor seems to be a level of exhaustion. \n\nWith my legs, I can feel them getting weaker and like the communication to them is shutting off like a faucet. So I get myself to a safe place and settle in. \n\nMy full body attacks have come on faster with no warning. \n\nToday though I was feeling miserable. Tired and out of it more than usual. Feeling a lot of pressure, for lack of a better word, kind of like how you feel before you throw up. \n\nI unlocked my door and got settled into my normal spot as my arms froze this time. I was afraid it would be my whole body. \n\nI avoided seeing doctors for a year because everyone wanted to write me off as having conversion disorder and was dealing with lung issues unrelated to Covid (rheumatoid nodules that went rogue). \n\nOne ER trip showed low, end of the normal spectrum K and super high off the chart TSH (thyroid). My thyroid is always normal. My second ER trip showed similar K but normal TSH. \n\nOut of my 12 episodes, only 2 ER trips because I was tired of the psych evals and illicit drug tests.

I still can't help but feel like I'm just crazy or over dramatic and I'm making it all up in my head even though I have more proof than I could ever need. I'm struggling to find out exactly how much potassium I can have, and even when I watch my diet I still have episodes. I fell tonight while making dinner and I had to sit on my kitchen floor while my food burned. I was driving home from a friend's house at 2am not long ago and was suddenly paralyzed and stuck in the middle of nowhere for 2 hours unable to reach my phone. I've had episodes in class, in the grocery store, going up and down stairs.... In between episodes while I'm recovering, I can barely hold my phone, walk, or eat. I'm so afraid of leaving my house for fear of an attack in public. I'm afraid of somebody just coming along and snatching me up while I'm incapacitated, especially if I'm out late at night. \n\nI know some of these fears are irrational and I can't just give up my life out of fear. But how does anyone get past this? How are all of you able to just go out in public and let people see you if you happen to have an episode? \n\nOn top of that, I got married just before my diagnosis. My husband has been with me by my side the entire time and has helped so much... I can't help but think about what the rest of our lives are going to look like with me (and likely our children) suffering from this disease? He already has a bad back, he won't be able to pick me up and carry me into the house or put me on the sofa forever. Not only that, but I feel like such a burden to him. He loves me and assures me I'm not, but it's only been a few weeks. We have years ahead of us...\n\nIdk guys. I've been crying so much. I'm the person who others come to for help and advice. I help others, not the other way around. I don't do drama, I don't cry, I don't rely on anyone else. I'm literally going to college for 12 years to get my PhD so I can work at NASA and my husband can be a stay at home father. And then this happens.

Of course depleting glycogen through exercise only is a highly unstable form of ketosis, and that's actually why it is the 4th time I try to sustain such a diet/way of life but it's a mined field and my mood can be easily and suddenly thrown off balance by little details mostly in my diet.\n\nThe condition I think I have is hypokalemic sensory overload and it can look a bit like ADHD (mostly trouble contentrating), with episodes of sensory overload (mostly being over-sensitive to sound and generally irritable) - up to panic attacks. From the research I've done it seems to share some common ground with epilepsy, autism and like I said ADHD. **This is the reason I'm trying to gather everybody together : those condition share common genetic grounds, and their treatment also could have a lot in common.**\n\nI thus think we could benefit all from sharing our stories, tips &amp; tricks or life hacks, cooking suggestions or survival kits into facing these rare and complex disorders. So far a lot of people seem to be gathering around r/keto, r/ketoscience, r/epilepsy, r/therapeutic_keto, r/PeriodicParalysis and other communities. However in larger groups the discussion can't focus enough on our special needs and we often aren't taken seriously by people more focused on weight loss - as their diet is less restrictive. Those people have the right to be suspicious about pseudo-scientific claims because the world of ketogenic diets is full of marketing claims only focused at making profit. But that doesn't mean our reality - namely that the ketogenic diet has profound psychological/neurological effects - is nonexistent. \n\nI think if we all gathered around one subreddit - such as r/MedicalKeto (which seems to have been here the longest and has the most members) we could build such a supportive &amp; helpful community.

Of course depleting glycogen through exercise only is a highly unstable form of ketosis, and that&amp;#39;s actually why it is the 4th time I try to sustain such a diet/way of life but it&amp;#39;s a mined field and my mood can be easily and suddenly thrown off balance by little details mostly in my diet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The condition I think I have is hypokalemic sensory overload and it can look a bit like ADHD (mostly trouble contentrating), with episodes of sensory overload (mostly being over-sensitive to sound and generally irritable) - up to panic attacks. From the research I&amp;#39;ve done it seems to share some common ground with epilepsy, autism and like I said ADHD. &lt;strong&gt;This is the reason I&amp;#39;m trying to gather everybody together : those condition share common genetic grounds, and their treatment also could have a lot in common.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thus think we could benefit all from sharing our stories, tips &amp;amp; tricks or life hacks, cooking suggestions or survival kits into facing these rare and complex disorders. So far a lot of people seem to be gathering around &lt;a href=\"/r/keto\"&gt;r/keto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/r/ketoscience\"&gt;r/ketoscience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/r/epilepsy\"&gt;r/epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/r/therapeutic_keto\"&gt;r/therapeutic_keto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/r/PeriodicParalysis\"&gt;r/PeriodicParalysis&lt;/a&gt; and other communities. However in larger groups the discussion can&amp;#39;t focus enough on our special needs and we often aren&amp;#39;t taken seriously by people more focused on weight loss - as their diet is less restrictive. Those people have the right to be suspicious about pseudo-scientific claims because the world of ketogenic diets is full of marketing claims only focused at making profit. But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean our reality - namely that the ketogenic diet has profound psychological/neurological effects - is nonexistent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think if we all gathered around one subreddit - such as &lt;a href=\"/r/MedicalKeto\"&gt;r/MedicalKeto&lt;/a&gt; (which seems to have been here the longest and has the most members) we could build such a supportive &amp;amp; helpful community.

I mean heck, no doctor could ever understand and always passed it off as \"growing pains\" or \"growth spurts\" and my family saw it as \"legs falling asleep\" during long car rides or if I fell, then I was just clumsy. So literally have never told anyone.\n\nFor as long as I can remember I would be worried \"my legs wouldn't work\" after sitting for too long. As early as Kindergarten, I knew getting into \"circle time\" or a quiet 'don't get out of your seat' time meant I'd have to do everything to fidget and prevent an attack or be in a position that wouldnt leave me completely helpless (knees bent on the chair and propped up near a table, or fake sharpen my pencil, or pretend to stretch or tie my shoe) so that I could be 'ready' to move when everyone else would be. This consumed me, especially in the morning when it was much more likely to happen. When I was required to take gym in high school in the morning and we had to swim to the bottom to retrieve a brick and return, I fully accepted that I may drown. Looking back now it seems absolutely insane, but it was also that I didn't want to be different from anyone so I was doing everything I could to just get by without any help. I also remember driving with my mom once and an attack came on suddenly while I was coming up to a stoplight and couldnt apply pressure to the brake and had to tell my mom to push on my knee so that I could brake. Then I fell into the snow once and she had to help me up. Luckily I became good at deferring attention and coming up with believable stories. Countless other embarrassing times have happened. Once sitting in college lecture by the light switch just out of reach and the professor about to show thr class a video so he asks me to turn the lights off but I couldn't lift my arm up with enough strength unless I propped my other arm up. I dont know what people thought but all these experiences have definitely affected me in some way. Luckily the symptoms have generally lessened as I've gotten older, or at least I've figured out all the subtle ways to get around it so it impacts me less. But I still process and filter all things through \"will I be able to move?\" Wherher it's a long road trip, sitting during a movie, being outside in the cold too long, etc.\n\nMy biggest dilemma as I'm 30 is deciding how much of a chance I'd be taking of passing it on to my child if I decided to have a family. I would never wish it on anybody. I will have to look into genetic testing obviously.\n\nI guess I'm just reaching out to see of anybody else wants to share their story!\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PeriodicParalysis", "subreddit_id": "t5_tsvd0", "subreddit_subscribers": 16, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do you tell people suffering silence?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PeriodicParalysis/comments/euzvb5/do_you_tell_people_suffering_silence/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tb877", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ijfp2el", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1580129832, "domain": "self.PeriodicParalysis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PeriodicParalysis/comments/eunjns/i_have_hypokalemic_sensory_overload_and_i_think_i/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eunjns", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/PeriodicParalysis/comments/eunjns/i_have_hypokalemic_sensory_overload_and_i_think_i/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1580129833, "score": 1, "selftext": "Don't know if this message will be read by many people but here it goes.
