I am typing it on my phone and have issues with spelling/ formatting. \n\nWhen I was little I got diagnosed with sotos like syndrome. This was after seeing a whole team of suppose able specialist in the medical field. Growing up as a young kid my life was fairly normal until fourth grade. In fourth and fifth grade I had 3 fainting episodes. They hooked me up to a machine that I walked around with for a week after the third fainting spell. The test came back inconclusive. My team of doctors told my parents they couldn't explain it. Now while growing up in Nebraska from age 2 to 12 I always had friends and was socially accepted.  I did always have issues learning andy mind wondered easily.\n\n\nAround the summer of 2000 we moved to Idaho. Now this is when my life fell apart. I had issues making friends I was 6 2 and 80 pounds. This caused alot of people to claim I was anorexic. Luckily one of the girls on my block knew better. I was always eating my mom just simply left snacks out for me. Well one day I ate dinner at her house and whent home a hour later to eat my normal dinner. I was still at this point diagnosed wih sotos-like syndrome. When I was about 14 still tall amd lanky. I was running to our truck in a parking lot and slipped on some sand. My knee instantly swelled and the pain didn't go away for a good hour. At this point we went to the ER to get it checked. The doctor was curious about my other knee, so they took an xray of it. At the point they determined both of my knees where fucked. During the start of moving to idaho I rode bmx bikes and dirt bikes to excape. While I was sitting in the er room a airmen came by. I was not aware of this since he talked with my dad. They start having a convo about my diagnosis and my dad tells him I had sotos-like. Well the airmen mentions to him to have a ekg to see if I have marfans. This airmens friend in high school had it and I looked like him. So I wasn't diagnosed with marfans until I was about 15 years old. At this point I learned about how important it was to protect my aorta.  This included wearimg a chest protector while having fun.\n\nI have had my heart scanned and my aorta has not changed within my three scans. It has always been like 2.4 or 3.4 I can find my records if needed.

I have been evaluated twice now for Marfan and both times the decision was null.  My heart is normal and I have just enough traits to starts to consider it. So the doctors say to not worry about it and just continue to watch my heart. \n\nSome background, I am 31 years old, 6\u20195\u201d and 185lbs. I was evaluated in 2002 and 2014. I have flexible joints (both hand and wrist signs), crowded teeth, longer arms, maybe a concave chest, flat feet, maybe facial features, diverticulitis (some say it is, some says it is not a sign), and near sighted with an astigmatism, not sure if I missed anything else.  \n\nMy most recent echo showed a 3.4 cm aortic root, and mitral valve flattening with no regurgitation or stenosis, but not prolapse (my bother has MVP but no signs of Marfan what so ever so this might not be related). The summary of the echo was: \u201c1) Normal transthoracic echocardiogram. 2) No echo findings diagnostic of or consistent with Marfan syndrome.\u201d I have had EKGs and full blood work over the years with no findings.\n\nThe doctors have said if I wanted I could have genetic testing, but I\u2019m not sure if it is worth it, will it change anything. I plan to keep up with echos every 3-4 years per doctor\u2019s order to make sure nothing changes heart wise, but is there anything else I need to do or know if I may have Marfans. Also I run casually (half marathons and such). Since I have no heart issues should I be concerned, should I back off. I asked my doctors and they would not give me a straight answer. \n\nOverall I am just looking for some guidance on living with potential Marfan and what I should be aware of. Most of what I read centers around heart issues (which I understand is present in 90% of cases) but I find little information on other areas. Should I see a specialist, if so who/why? Most resources point to cardiologist, but do I need another one if there were no findings on my echo?\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Potential Marfans", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/2arlk9/potential_marfans/"}, {"author": "Wannacrackermate", "author_created_utc": 1340118029, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_81qjl", "created_utc": 1405359848, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/2aon9k/marfans/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2aon9k", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/2aon9k/marfans/", "retrieved_on": 1441268645, "score": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "marfans", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/2aon9k/marfans/"}, {"author": "ne999", "author_created_utc": 1215123313, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_36pxm", "created_utc": 1405202170, "domain": "facebook.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/2ajfsw/questions_about_marfans_this_subreddit_isnt_very/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2ajfsw", "is_self": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/2ajfsw/questions_about_marfans_this_subreddit_isnt_very/", "retrieved_on": 1441271136, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Questions about Marfan's?

I'm 6'2'' i've always been a tall kid, but never really lanky, i would  describe myself as a very medium build. But my wrists, and calves are quite small, but the upper part of my arms and legs are HUGE and my fingers are a bit on the long side. My feet are actually small for my size, and i have high arches, so that's a good sign right? I'm currently 180lbs, (down from 210lbs) i used to be a gym rat, working out 4-5 times a week, eating tons of food and giving it my all, but i really started getting extreme fatigue after workouts, i'd get, breathlessness, confusion, anxiety, and a whole giant list of symptoms, i thought i might be having heart trouble or maybe a respiratory issue, i have been tested for everything, from diabetes, to asthma, and so on.. I got EKG's which came out normal which was a big relief, but i still feel something is wrong. I was going to get a chest Xray, but the insurance never pulled through with authorization on that, i just never followed up.. Heart problems don't run in my family, but i'm worried i might have a heart problem so i stopped working out all together. My doctor basically thinks i'm crazy and doesn't take me serious. I lost so much weight as soon as i stopped working out and eating big.  \n\nI honestly have always felt just something \"off\" about my body, it's just so abnormal and different. I was reading up on a lot of the symptoms of marfans and i have basically almost all of them. I can just barely touch pinky and and index fingers around my wrist, my wingspan is a tad bit more than my height, i think it's around 6'2''-6'3'', I have stretch marks all over my thighs, but i was quite a bit fatter before i started working out, so that's a possibility too. I have a high palate, crowded teeth, and an overbite, but i think that's from sucking my thumb all the way until a few years into grade school. I also mouth breathed a lot in childhood, which definitely has an effect on your face. I am extremely flexible in my hips, legs, and back. I used to wrestle and highschool and my coach would always remark how abnormally flexible i am. Like i was able to get out of holds in ways that were just strange... i have extremely long legs and arms, my pelvis is out of alignment. Yet my spine is straight, i don't have scoliosis. I showed this to my doctor and he just said \"hm, that's weird.\" he also wanted to xray that, but it never happened. I also have always had pointed/crumpled looking ears. I've had them since i was a kid, and it honestly makes me definitely feel like i have a \"syndrome\" I was reading up on Beal's syndrome, which is a variation of Marfan's and my stomach SANK when i saw \"crumbled ears\" as a symptom. My niece who was just born a couple months ago has the EXACT SAME crumbled looking ears as me. Like exactly the same on both sides, leading me to believe it's some weird genetic thing i have, not just a fluke..

I heeded his advice, and doc guessed EDS type 4. A second GP echoed that. Just before the new year I finally met with my Rheum- and he hit me with a big one- Marfans- which of course I had come across in my \"research\", and to be frank, terrified me. Due to the presence of both Marfan and EDS characteristics, I am now waiting for April to roll around for my first meeting with my very own genetic counsellor for definitive testing. \n\nA minor revelatory moment occurred when, in the midst of my panic, I came to the conclusion that regardless what name you give it, I am still exactly who I am the way that I always have been. Nothing is new, nothing is different, nothing will be changing because of the name that it is given. A breath of fresh air. \n\nAt any rate, here I am! 23 year old female. I am certainly marfanoid in appearance, at 5'10\" weighing in at 115lbs, incredibly long fingers, what my rheum called \"fairly severe pectus excavatum\", scoliosis, and the list goes on. What I do NOT have, however, is corrective lenses (though I could probably use some, but have not had my vision checked since elementary school) or any immediate concerns regarding heart health that I am aware of, though I do frequently experience tachycardia and a miscellany of other oddities of my vital signs. \n\nSo, my question for you all is this: those of you diagnosed without family history, what was your journey like? How has the dx (having a name for it, I mean) changed your lifelong journey? Are there things about it that you continue to struggle with?\nThose of you who, like myself, have the presence of some of the signs and features while others are absent, do you have family members who also vary in degrees/severity or in the manifestation of the typical \"signs\"? What has your journey been like? \n\nI'm interested to learn a little bit more about a world that seems so foreign, but to which I may have been a member of all along!

Just hoping to get some advice/guidance.\n\nSo I came across info on Marfan's Syndrome about 6 years ago when looking up stretches for a shoulder injury (related to my joint problems) and was taken aback by how many of the signs/symptoms I have.\n\nI've never brought it up to a doctor because my family basically chuckled and said that I'm being a hypochondriac. Something made me think of it again recently so I thought I'd post here and get some advice on whether it's something I should approach a doctor about? I don't have any super obvious symptoms looks-wise but there are quite a few things that I do have.\n\nSo to start I'm a 25 year old female. I'd say average height: 5'6\" to 5'7\" depending on the doctor lol and about 120lbs. This is going to be a long post probably sorry.\n\nGeneral Things:\n\nI was very thin, doctors always pegged me as underweight, growing up and into my early 20s but have filled out more the last few years. \n\nI have long and somewhat \"knobby\" limbs - elbows kind of stick out, knock-kneed, etc. I have very small wrists and ankles and can wrap my thumb and middle finger around my wrist and overlap.\n\nMore specific things:\n\nI have a \"joint disorder.\" They never put an exact name on it other than hyper-mobility. Basically my ligaments are looser or extra stretchy. I'm not flexible persay, but my joints extend farther than they should. My knees sit farther back than they should and I have no idea how to explain this but have you seen people put their palms down on the table and turn their elbows in and out? I can do that - things like that. I have a lot of joint pain.\n\nI have fairly large hands with long fingers and small wrists. \n\nNothing abnormal has ever been found at the eye doctor but I am nearsighted with astigmatism in both eyes.\n\nI don't think I have \"concave\" chest, but I do have an uneven one. One side of my chest is sticks out considerably farther than the other (left side for anyone curious lol).\n\nI have a small jaw, crowded teeth, and a very high arch in my mouth.\n\nI'm not flat footed, but I have \"abnormal arches\" and had to wear special shoe inserts for sports when I was younger.\n\nI have a narrow face but not strangely long or anything.\n\nI know this isn't necessarily related, I've heard there can be a correlation, but I have ADHD as well.\n\nThat said, I have a perfectly straight spine and no heart or lung defects or issues that I know of. Other than an umbilical hernia surgery when I was one years old, I've never had surgeries or any major illnesses.\n\nI don't have breathing problems really but I had an inhaler for \"sports induced asthma\" when I was in high school. I was a long distance runner (cross country) so it was mainly for that. Nowadays I get out of breath easy but I attribute that to being 25, out of shape, and a smoker lol.\n\nThe thing is, I know I inherited a lot of this from my dad. My dad and I look a lot alike and have a lot of things in common. My dad is tall and thin (about 6'3\"-6'4\" and 225lbs - he's a little heavier now in his 50s lol but he was very thin when I was a kid). He also has large hands, small wrists, and long limbs. He also has a narrow face, crowded teeth, high palette, and the same uneven upper chest - his is visibly noticeable. Then again, mine probably would be too if I wasn't a female - luckily breasts hide it pretty well.\n\nMy dad has heart problems though and lung problems. Nothing too serious just a fairly mild arrhythmia which he takes medication for and then high blood pressure. The lung thing was more serious but is okay now. When I was 7 (so he was about 38) his lung collapsed. I don't remember the details but it was not from pneumonia or anything like that. They ended up having to remove it and he has one lung now.\n\nAnyways, please forgive the novel! Do you think this is something I should see a doctor about or just leave well enough alone and forget about it?\n\nEDIT: Added a couple details :)\n\n\n \n\n  ", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I've always been curious if I could possibly have this...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/3zxmxh/ive_always_been_curious_if_i_could_possibly_have/"}, {"author": "allenselmo", "author_created_utc": 1426417084, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_m7h19", "created_utc": 1452103386, "domain": "self.marfans", "edited": 1452103663, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/3zqyvw/echocardiograms/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3zqyvw", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 11, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/3zqyvw/echocardiograms/", "retrieved_on": 1454981117, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi all,\n so I have been assessed in the past by my General Practitioners (two different doctors, two different occassions) by matching me up to the criteria of marfans (the standard stuff; tall, slim, pectus excavatum etc). This was because it was, both times, brought up by me due to my similarity with some features; tall, slim, crowded teeth, high palate, mild pectus excavatum (although I believe that was because I was squashed at birth, as my arm fits perfectly into it). So, as I say, the gp's checked my heartbeat and neither were convinced on the seperate occasions, however one sent me off to get an x-ray of my chest to check that side of things was okay (the bone stuff). Results; all is well. The second time I saw my GP one said I could \"rule it out\".\n\nMonths later I went to a pre-op for a deviated septum surgery and the pre-op guy had it on his computer something about marfans regarding me. So they did a test (not sure what it was, my apologies) where they stuck loads of wires all over me and let this machine do its thing, to do with my heart. That was all good, then they listened to my heart and he thought he heard a murmur, another woman came in and she listed to my heart and agreed that she also heard it. She then spoke to me about marfans (explaining it and stuff). She asked about my family history, I said no heart problems at all (that I know of), we are tall skinny folk. Another doctor said it *could* be a mutation, but my family seem to look like me anyways and hold my features. I was sent for an echocardiogram anyhow.\n\nResults are I am fine, all is well. I should have said earlier, I am 18 years old, male. The man phoned me back up and said I have been cleared and that I have been assessed (with marfans being the primary concern). So he said distinctively I do not have it, with confidence...\n\nHowever, I *feel* as though it would be wise to maybe try and get another echo a few years? Not sure how easy that is (I live in UK btw) can I please have your thoughts? \n\nThank you so much for reading I know I ramble.

I'm 26 and female.  I know a lot of people post here about how they're tall and skinny so they're worried they have Marfans but I'm actually the opposite of that...you'll see, haha (be forewarned, I do have an anxiety disorder but this concern is actually reasonable)\n\nMy dad just got diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm (a very mild case not even needing meds) and his doctor believes it could POTENTIALLY have been caused by Marfans (it's definitely a tissue disorder, she's just not sure which one).  My dad has many Marfans traits: tall, skinny, stretch marks, very long face, crowded teeth, history of hernia, etc.  But not all of the signs.\n\nI, on the other hand, have almost no signs.  The only thing I have is a slightly oblong face (like Blake Lively the actress, I guess?) and some crowded teeth before I got braces, and both of these things have run in the family for generations.  I'm actually not even tall, and I'm not that thin, and my legs are actually short and thick for my trunk (like noticeably pear shaped and squat).  I guess on a good note, I have great blood pressure.\n\nAt first I assumed there was no way I had Marfans but then I found out it could be asymptomatic!  I'm trying not to freak out but now I'm also worried that I could already have a SEVERE aortic aneurysm (just because my dad's is mild doesn't mean mine would be right?)  I used to do a lot of heavy weightlifting, so what if I already have an aortic dilation that's like...8 cm?? (My dad's is 4.3 and it appeared in middle age, but still.)\n\nI'm worried about how I'm going to give birth safely. My husband and I want to have children and I'm worried that won't happen for me now.  Even if it isn't Marfans, it's something else I could have easily inherited.  Plus, my husband says he will stay with me regardless but he also thinks there's like a 0% chance that I have it.  If he leaves me, will it be possible for me to date?  Will this be a huge red flag for most people? I have no interest in men other than my husband but if he leaves me I'll want to remarry.  As you can see, I'm totally spiraling.  My head is just spinning right now.\n\nI'm also so worried about the prospect of surgery.  My dad presented it to me like \"Well people with my heart condition sometimes need surgery which fixes you up and it's super easy\" but then I read online that there is a high mortality rate.  I don't want to die before I'm even middle aged.  I just don't know how to piece all these things together right now.  \n\n**TLDR: Dad probably has Marfans or something similar, I have no major symptoms of any of this stuff but very worried I'm an asymptomatic case and I'm worried about dying young or dying in surgery**\n\nSorry to be so dramatic but I've really never had ANY health issues in my life other than anxiety, so this is so new to me and I need to find a way to function!

I am 6'1\" with a thin frame (much thinner-looking back then), but I wouldn't say I look dramatically like I have Marfan.  My dad had had an aortic dissection and was saved in emergency surgery.\n\nA couple of years later, I got an MRI (or some type of radiology) done on part of my spine, I believe to check for dural ectasia, at the advice of the geneticist.  At that time my diagnosis was reversed--the geneticist advised me that the radiology results told us conclusively that I didn't have Marfan.\n\nSome years later, my father had new aortic aneurysms and elected to have surgery to prevent another dissection and hopefully prolong his life.  He died as a result of complications of the surgery.  \n\nShortly thereafter, someone suggested to me that it made sense for me (and other family members) to be screened for Marfan again.  When I called the office I had years earlier worked with, I spoke with a genetic counselor who advised that I'd better make sure I have life insurance before proceeding to get re-screened.\n\nI have delayed the process for years because I am easily overwhelmed and don't know where to get started with the life insurance.  I don't know what kind to get, how much to get, etc.  I am not married and don't have a family yet.  I don't really anticipate having a family, but I can't rule it out yet, and anyway, I'd want my girlfriend/wife taken care of.\n\nI'm feeling like it's dumb to delay Marfan screening or at least an echocardiogram/abdominal ultrasound.  For a while I was doing some heavy (for me) weight lifting, and it made me feel good, but I recently read that's not a wise move if I have Marfan or aortic issues, so I've stopped, and feel worse for it.  \n\nIf anyone has dealt with the life insurance situation, I'd certainly appreciate any pointers.  Maybe I should be posting this question to a finance forum, but I'm interested in Marfan-specific experiences--have people been successful getting life insurance post-diagnosis? are the premiums punitive at that point? do you need to have the insurance for a certain number of years before getting the diagnosis to avoid the policy being rescinded?\n\nThanks for reading!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Life insurance pre-diagnosis?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/3528j2/life_insurance_prediagnosis/"}, {"author": "SWaspMale", "author_created_utc": 1352477404, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_9jyon", "created_utc": 1430875011, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/350biu/700_usd_for_an_echocardiogram_is_that_reasonable/", "gilded": 0, "id": "350biu", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 10, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/350biu/700_usd_for_an_echocardiogram_is_that_reasonable/", "retrieved_on": 1440752482, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I was shocked, and apparently my insurance will *not* pay for it :(  I just want to know what they bill for yours, and how often you have to get one.

I recently had some issues with my heart were it would beat fast (Between around high 80's at rest and around 120's with physical movement). So naturally we looked into this. Allot happened, but i eventually got an Echocardiogram. During this time my doctor informed me about Marfans Syndrome by testing if i could do the hand thing (Where your thumb can pass through your closed hand). Now this got me really worried, I'm kind of tall, but still shorter than most of my friends and people my age. I'm fairly skinny, i have long-ish fingers and toes and i got diagnosed with (Extremely mild) Scoliosus and Pectus Excevanum. Apart from those features, i don't have anything else. No eye issues, no pains, no joint problems, i don't really get out of breath much or anything. If i never looked up the syndrome i honeslty woudn't even suspect i had anything. Anyway, the Echocardiogram came back 100% normal, as in everything was fine, healthy, normal and working well. I discussed with my GP (as we reviewed the results) about the possibility of me having Marfans. He basically told me that they looked into it since i had some features and said that i could have a very mild case of it (Where i have some features of it but not the full thing, atleast not the heart issues). I personally don't care if i have the \"Looks\" of marfans, i'm worried about the Heart Issues, so i asked him about that and he re-asured me that my heart is perfectly normal, that the Echo checks everything and that i'll be fine. He said to my mum if i'm really worried about it, that it wont hurt to get some check ups every few months or so just to be sure. Now my question for you guys is, Is my Doctor/GP right? Do Echocardiograms show marfans (atleast heart related issues)? Should i stress? because i'ts been giving me really bad anxiety recently and i just kind of want it off my mind. If my heart shows up perfectly normal on an Echo, does that mean i will never have marfans related heart issues? I just want to be safe (and not worry so much). If anyone could answer and ease my anxiety driven mind, i would thank you a thousand times over.

I've always been anxious about my health, and it's mostly heart and cardiovascular disease. I've had tests done by a cardiologist and he said I was fine. This was really helpful, since I didn't have much anxiety for months since I've been there. My aunt died of a ruptured aorta a few years ago at a fairly young age (reason I was seeing a cardiologist), and yesterday I went on google again, and googled aortic aneurysms. I know, very stupid. I recalled my cardiologist telling me I had a diameter of 3cm's in my descending aorta and 3.3 in my thoracic arch. He told me that was common for tall and physically active people like me. I believed him but now I googled these diameters and it says that 3cm is the upper limit for a normal abdominal aorta. Above is considered an aneurysm! I'm 20 y/o. the thought that it is still in the 'normal' range should calm me, but it does not. Why is it not more normal. Could it just be that I misunderstood him, and that he actually meant another part of my aorta? This is just another example of how crippling my hypochondria is. I had a cardiologist tell me I'm fine but it's not enough. Reason's I believe it might be marfan's are: I am tall and I have scheuermann's (although a comorbidity with marfan's is excluded). I don't have hypermobility in any way. I have one lazy eye, the other one is in perfect condition. Well you get the point, looking up the symptoms of marfan's were a good scare.

After a long time of being teased and tormented by others because they did not understand my invisible illness and the debilitating effects of it I attempted to find someone who would employ me and join society to the best of my ability. Luckily an outsourcer call center hired me and I worked long enough to lose my disability for wages earned and then lost my job. Next my health progressively became worse and I eventually needed surgery for my heart. This happens while I'm trying to go back to college and I end up having to drop out. I end up with medical debt and college loans but \"fortunately\" my health became poor enough that after a 2yr uphill battle of reapplying for SSDI I was awarded a meager amount each month of about $570/month but with the bonus of having insurance. Unfortunately it was not enough to live on, I decided, and was forced to again try to get employed. To my luck a temp agency hired me but only if I worked full time at $10/hr. I was desperate again, made the same mistake, and by the time my term was up at the temp agency I had set the wheels in motion to lose my SSDI once again. I wisely decided to find a job that would be under the wage/hours necessary to keep my SSDI and was hired at a hospital at a desk job to cover as needed for a couple hours so the other person there could go home earlier. Yet the catch was I had to do full time training for a few months and then the other person quit, leaving me again in a predicament. \n\nSo now I have finally had my hours reduced in the hopes I can keep my SSDI but I am still $16 to $400 over the limit of $1090/month if I get 3 paychecks in one month. The only thing I can think of is maybe I can claim some sort of work related expenses but have no idea what can be considered as any person who has answered my calls at the SSA office tells me I can't qualify for exemptions like mileage costs for my vehicle because that's for people in wheelchairs who have a special van or something and that I need to \"stay out of trouble\".\n\nPlease help if you have any insight into this kind of issue.

The skin on the soles of his feet is also ridiculously smooth, yet he walks around bare foot a lot.\n\nHypermobile joints. His whole family are prone to it, apparently. He can get both legs behind his head without any discomfort at all, aged 22. His joints also click a lot - fingers, jaw, feet etc.\n\nTall, skinny with long limbs (not sure if they are long compared to his height - would have to measure).\nA protruding sternum. It kind of pokes out on one side.\n\nEye problems. He is short-sighted, and has had some kind of odd lens problem from birth - I can't remember exactly what it is, but I know that the doctors said it was unusual. Something to do with veins in the eye. His whole family have glaucoma and eye sight problems.\n\nStretch marks on his back, hips and shoulders. He says this was from when he was chubby as a teenager, but I don't see how simply being chubby would give you fat shoulders. They've now faded.\n\nHe has also had random chest pains for years every now and then, and has high blood pressure. His teeth and back seem normal. Rather than having flat feet he also has very high arches. He's never had any medical problems as far as I'm aware - just these physical traits.\n\nThe problem is that a UK GP will take one look at him asking questions about this and not take it seriously, at least not where we live. They will just think he's worrying too much, especially as he has no known relatives with the syndrome (though he never met his dad) and the tests for it are inconclusive and expensive in some cases. This concerns me due to his occasional chest pains. If it weren't for this problem I wouldn't be posting for a second opinion.\n\nThanks for any help/tips.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Concerned about a friend - and about getting any UK doctor to pay attention", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/2u6kge/concerned_about_a_friend_and_about_getting_any_uk/"}, {"author": "GunstarGreen", "author_created_utc": 1331828050, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_76g5d", "created_utc": 1421408831, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/2smcmz/possible_marfans_anybody_relate/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2smcmz", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 7, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/2smcmz/possible_marfans_anybody_relate/", "retrieved_on": 1440963311, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi there. Not sure where to begin. \n\nLast August I got submitted to hospital for inverted t-waves after I went to a walk in clinic for persistent heart palpitations. I had a few ECGs and blood pressure taken, but the doctor suspected I had Marfan's syndrome. This was news to me as i've never heard of it, and i'd just hit 31 years old. I was shaking like a leaf from cold in the hospital, and the doctor was feeling my hands and toes. \n\nI've had some follow up tests since then. Chest x-ray, echo, bloods. I think they were searching for a disease rather than possible Marfan's. They all came back clear. I also just had a seven-day monitor removed from me, and i'm waiting on the results. \n\nI've been doing some gentle looking up on Marfan's, as I don't want to spook myself. However, it all fits. I'm myopic, with astigmatism. I am only 6'1, but i'm very lean - considered underweight by BMI even though I eat whatever and whenever I feel like. I've actually had times in my life where i've tried to get in shape and eat well, but i've not seen any difference in my weight. I feel the cold incredibly badly, especially in my fingers and toes (I know that's normal, but I shiver like a leaf). I have always had the odd palpitation with my heart too, but I put that down to my mother having a heart murmur. Worst of all though is my back and joints. Since my youth my elbows and knees have clicked dreadfully, but my back has been horrid since my early twenties, and i've had herniated discs. I live in near constant back and hip pain, but no doctors take me too seriously. This despite I walk a lot of the time, and try to stay active. My wrists, knuckles, ankles and knees click like tin drums, and my right shoulder makes more noise than I can possibly imagine. When I went to see my GP about it, he said my shoulders possibly hypermobile - he said that my joints moved really freely. My chest is only 34 inches, and my ribs are easy to spot. \n\nSince my little episode last summer my heart has been stressing a lot more easily. Just a simple jog up the stairs seems to take longer to recover from. I'm also really feeling the cold this year despite it being comparatively mild. I am a twin (non-identical), but my brother has actually had weight issues in the past, unlike me. I'm far more slender than my family, especially my mother's side, where all the guys are broad and bulky. \n\nSo that's my story. Does this resonate with anyone? I actually don't mind the idea of having this syndrome (if indeed I have it at all) because it fits. I've always been gaunt, skinny and looked underdeveloped for my age. I actually only look about 21 despite being a decade older. So this potential diagnosis would go some way to explaining it all. It would also mean maybe some doctors would start taking me seriously. \n\nThanks for reading.

I'm currently recovering from my sec ond surgery on my heart.  This time I had my aorta valve replaced.  My previous surgery was to repair an aortic root aneurism.  I thought I would share my experience with the surgery, and the recovery to help any of you who have yet to go through the procedure understand what happens during the process.  \n\nPreparing for the surgery\n\nFirst if you can, and your Doctor gives you the go ahead.  Try to be in the best shape you can before you have the procedure done.  I was not in the best physical shape before my first surgery, and the following recovery was much harder on me.  I was very weak, and it took me longer to build my strength back to normal.  I had a few months to prepare before this surgery, and I used that time to build my my heart strength by doing a lot of walking.  Nothing strenuous. Just 30 to 40 minuets of walking a day really helped me out.  I'm farther along in my recovery compared to last time because my heart was stronger and more able to bounce back from being cut on.  \n\nThe surgery, and your hospital stay.\n\nThis part is the most harrowing, but you'll be O.K.  When you first wake up after the surgery you'll be in the ICU, and you'll be hooked up to a lot of machines that are keeping you alive.  You might be hooked up to a breathing tube when you regain conscious you might not.  If you are still hooked up to a breathing tube it's not that bad and you'll be under the influence of so much pain medication that you won't care.  You will also have a catheter inserted and many different I V's inserted in various areas of your body. You'll also have two drainage tubes inserted in your chest, and wires inserted in your chest that are attached to a temporary pace maker. It's an odd feeling having machines do all the work of keeping you alive.  It's the ultimate experience of laziness.  You don't have to do anything. Machines do it all. Once the ICU team decides you can breathe on you own. They will remove the breathing tube.  This is not as bad as it sounds and is over quickly.  You'll then be breathing pure O2 for awhile. Some things I experienced that i feel are worth noting.  I was very thirsty during this time.  I could not get enough water,  They had to restrict my water intake because I was drinking so much. Also I had some bad experience with nausea.  I don't know if your experience will be the same as mine, but I thought it worth mentioning.  Once you've been breathing on your own for awhile you'll be discharged from the ICU and placed into the cardiac recovery ward.  You'll be in some pain.  The pain is odd.  You would expect that the pain would be in the area where they cut you open, but I felt the most pain in my shoulders and back.  They'll keep you well medicated, and trust me it helps.  They also encourage you to let thr before it gets bad than it is to help a person who is suffering from a high level of pain.  As the week goes on the nurses will slowly remove the various tubes and wires attached to you, and your body will slowly return to normal.  It takes time for your body, for lack of a better term, reboot.  They'll remove the catheter and you'll have trouble moving your bladder at first, but keep trying it the waters will flow, you'll bowels will take some time to get moving as well.  The pain meds they have you on slows down the process. Don't be shy if you need something to help the process along. You'll be encouraged to walk around and you'll have a physical therapy nurse to help you along.  Near the end of your hospital stay they will remove the drainage tubes from your chest, and the wires that where connected to the temporary pacemaker.  They will then observe you to see if any compilations arose from the tube removal, or if you picked up any infections during the hospital stay.  They will also keep an eye on you to see if any blood clots have developed.  If everything went well you will be discharged from the hospital and return home.  \n\nRecovery at home.\n\nThey will discharge you with a bunch of meds. to take over the next ten days, and you will still be in a fair bit of pain for about a week or two, but it subsides quickly.  You will also feel weak.  You will sleep alot and your sleep pattern will be very erratic for the next few weeks. You'll slowly return to normal as time goes on.  You will not be able to drive a car for a mo th as your breast bone heals, so have someone lined up to help you with you day to day tasks and do some food shopping for you.  Get some rest and work on building up your stamina back up, but don't overwork yourself.  Keep it slow and steady and you'll be back to normal in no time.\n\nI hope this helps somebody who has questions about valve replacement/aneurism repair surgery.  I'm sorry if the formatting is off.  I'm typing this on my phone. Once I get back home. I will edit this into an easier to read format.

My fingers and Hands are thin but completely proportional. No flat feet. No family history of marfans are heart problems, only diabetes, not sure if that's relevant.\n\nThat's all I can think to say right now.

Pleurodesis surgery on the right lung. \n- I am nearsighted, more so in the left eye.\n- I easily get out of breath/very bad fatigue but I'm very active. \n\nStory: \n\nI have noticed during the last year or so that I get some serious heart palpitations and racing heart beats while laying down on my right side in bed. And two days ago I decided to use the helpful tool Google to see why. The first thing that caught my eye was Marfan syndrome. Do you know why? Well, I remember talking with my doctor about it after my third pneumothorax. I believe it was mentioned briefly and they never actually checked me for the disorder. \nSo now it got me all interested. I checked the symptoms and noticed that I do have few \"Marfan\" specific symptoms... like some unexplained stretch marks(never been overweight), jaw problems(especially opening my mouth fully), wrists on the thinner side, nearsightedness. But **no** of the other physical symptoms like long fingers or arms, no scoliosis, etc. \nNo one in my family have any genetic disorders or heart problems that I know of. \n\nI will absolutely seek medical help for this since I do somewhat heavy weightlifting five days a week. \nThis post is mainly to calm myself down a bit and to hear some opinions. \nI should add that I have somewhat high blood pressure and I sometimes experience pain in my lower back for no obvious reason. \n\nSo what do you think? Does Marfan syndrome vary that much in symptoms? \n\n Thanks.\n\n*Edit: spelling.\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Asking for some advice.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/5pakh6/asking_for_some_advice/"}, {"author": "A-N-V", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1482991136, "domain": "nba.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/5kv9kg/isaiah_austin_cleared_to_play_basketball/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5kv9kg", "is_self": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/5kv9kg/isaiah_austin_cleared_to_play_basketball/", "retrieved_on": 1484452298, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Isaiah Austin Cleared To Play Basketball", "url": "http://www.nba.com/article/2016/12/01/isaiah-austin-cleared-play"}, {"author": "woo___hoo", "author_created_utc": 1479472376, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_12whhw", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1482817266, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/5ki4d9/should_i_be_concerned/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5ki4d9", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 12, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/5ki4d9/should_i_be_concerned/", "retrieved_on": 1484445271, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "To start off, I'm an 18y M, height 183cm (6\") and weight 64kg (I've been up to 68 before) so I'm slim but not that slim. \nI've always been physically active, playing soccer, table tennis etc and most recently play ultimate frisbee competitively. While I would consider myself fit, my stamins has always been an issue. Though I'm able to run 2.4 in 10.30 which is decent, I always feel excessively bad after hard exercise, ie light headedness/dizzy, chest pain while running long distances and I usually take up to 1 hour+ to recover after strenuous exercise ie long run, past what I think is normal. Sometimes I feel out of breath/light headed during the day sitting/standing and have to breathe heavily though I wouldn't say this is infrequent.\nAnyway, sometime back, maybe 3 years ago, my father who's a GP noticed my unusual features and conducted some simple physical tests for symptoms of Marfan's, and sent me for a 2D echo which fortunately returned no abnormalities. He concluded that Marfan's was out of the question.\n3 years on, I have multiple skeletal issues that have worsened after puberty, ie scoliosis, mild lordosis, pectus excavatum. \nCouple this with other typical Marfanoid symptoms like flat feet, high arched palate, arachnodactyly, hyperextension of the elbow, thumb test, slim wrists, long wingspan/body length ratio, hammer toes etc, and after doing more research on Marfan's, I'm beginning to consider if I may have this disease. However, considering that I have no family history nor heart problems which as I know is vital to diagnosis, I'm not sure how to go about getting a proper diagnosis.\nThe reason why this has resurfaced is that I am conscripting into the army in less than a week on 3rd Jan, and obviously training in the army will be strenuous. As such, can anyone help to address some of the following queries I have?\nIs it possible to have Marfan's without heart problems? \nIf no heart problems are diagnosed, is it possible for heart problems to appear later in life? \nWho should I see to get a proper look at my symptoms?\ntl;dr, I have many skeletal symptoms of Marfan's, no family history, no heart problems(that have been diagnosed so far), is there any chance I have Marfan's, and is it safe for me to serve in the army.

I've been working out 5-6 days a week for many years. \n\nI went to the doctor yesterday for a checkup, and he mentioned the possibility of Marfan's because of my build and the fact that I have scoliosis. Here are some details:\n\n- I have tall and thin features as does just about everyone in my family, especially on my mom's side. I look almost identical in build to her maternal grandfather and a few others in my family who have enjoyed long lives without medical intervention. \n- Nearsighted, as are many in my family. My vision was about -2.5 diopters in both eyes, where it remained stable for years, until I got lasik several years ago. No change since then. 20/20. \n- Scoliosis.\n- Very, very slight protrusion in my sternum, which is almost imperceptible.\n- Crowded teeth. Also runs in the family. \n- He said I had a murmur, but I've never had a physician tell me that before. My wife is a nurse, and she checked when I got home and told me I don't have one, or at least one that she can detect with her stethoscope, which is what the doctor used. She couldn't hear any whooshing at all, and me being the paranoid person that I am, I had her check several times in a quiet room. \n- My dad, who is 75, was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm a few years ago, BUT he smoked for 60 years, and that is a fairly common complication in lifelong smokers. He doesn't have the Marfan's look at all, and has no other health issues or symptoms typically associated with the disorder. Joints are fine. Didn't develop myopia until he was in his late 60's, etc. No family history of Marfan's or unexplained early deaths on his side. Aside from getting a tumor on his tongue from smoking, he has been healthy as a horse his entire life. \n\nNow for the complicating factors:\n\n- No joint problems or hypermobility whatsoever. I saw a bunch of flexibility tests for Marfan's online, and I can't come close to doing any of them. If anything, my joints are inflexible. I would say my joint health is better than average for people of my age, and I have never experienced a single issue with them, which is somewhat unusual for someone who grew up playing tennis on hard courts every day for hours. \n- Aside from myopia, I have no other eye issues, which was verified by the eye surgeon who performed my lasik procedure several years ago. Vision has been stable for years. He did the retina test during his post op checkup. \n- Normal hand and foot size for my height, if not on the small end (size 11 feet). My 5'7\" wife has hands that are almost as big as mine, although her hands are pretty large for a woman of her height. \n- Can't do either of the hand signs. Not even close on the thumb test. I read that 90% of people with Marfan's can do these, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. \n- High arches and normal rear feet. \n- No family history of Marfan's or of anyone dying early or unexpectedly. \n- No heart issues or episodes that I am aware of. \n- In spite of having scoliosis, I don't deal with any back pain. \n- No stretch marks anywhere on my body. \n- No lung issues, ever. No shortness of breath or being winded by routine tasks. \n- No chronic pain anywhere in my body. \n- I've always been told my doctors that I am in excellent condition for my age, and will regularly go on intense road bike rides at near full exertion for several hours. There has never been any indication that there is a problem, and I can do things like this and recover quickly. I did a Spartan Super (10 mile mud run with obstacles) a few months ago with no issues, and several 100 mile rides over the last few years, just to provide a little more info about my physical conditioning. I hope this doesn't come off as bragging, but I don't know anyone in my circle of friends or acquaintances who is as physically active as I am. \n\nI have an identical twin brother with a similar build who also has scoliosis, but no chest abnormality. He has led a similarly active life, although not quite to the degree that I have, and has had no heart or joint issues either. He had a doctor mention Marfan's to him 10-15 years ago (again because of the tall, thin build and scoliosis), but he went to a cardiologist who performed an echo that showed no abnormalities, and who told him that he didn't have Marfan's. He left it at that, and didn't investigate the matter further. We are mirror twins, and his health history is similar to mine in just about every way. \n\nI am aware that these things can exist on a spectrum, but what are your thoughts? Would it be unusual for both of us to make it this far without any issues, considering how active we both are? I'm a little bit of a worrier, so obviously when the doctor said those words, I was very concerned. I know you guys aren't doctors, but you do have personal experience with this that is relevant, so I'm curious to hear what you think.  \n\nBtw, between the two of us, we have four children, none of whom have any health issues that would raise suspicion of Marfan's. His are 15 and 12. Mine are 9 and 6. \n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Question", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/5hsyta/question/"}, {"author": "Jupytor", "author_created_utc": 1463116464, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_xw9fs", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1480661740, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/5g1xr8/tomorrow_my_husband_is_being_tested_for_marfans/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5g1xr8", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 14, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/5g1xr8/tomorrow_my_husband_is_being_tested_for_marfans/", "retrieved_on": 1484296027, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Tomorrow my husband is going in to be tested for Marfans.

He was 27 at the time.. we have so many plans,  we want to open a restaurant of our own.. travel.. have a family.. but there is such a limited amount of information available on the Internet I'm not sure how to proceed. Don't take me wrong, i have no intention of letting his condition get in the way of us living our lives together.. but we need to plan more carefully than other couples may have to whom aren't living with marfans. I keep reading that early diagnosis and treatment may give chance to living a normal span of years, but he has been diagnosed very late.. he slacks on taking his warfran and beta blockers but excuses it by taking double doses, is ths harmful?? Should he be working as hard as he is? When he lifts 20kg bags of potatoes is he putting himself at risk? Smoking, drinking? He is getting joint pain and bleeding gums every night. Head aches, fatigue.. i understand these are all symptoms but how extreme should they be, how much worse will they get? What can I do to help him? He struggles with weight gain.. I'm so lost as to what to do for him. Any information, insight, suggestions, help would be so very very appreciated.

I have chronic joint pain due to hypermobilty (diagnosed). Will following up a marfans possibility benefit me in any way? \n\n\nMy life seems an awful lot like a series of doctors visits at the moment.  I've been trying to get chronic migraines under control for the last 5 years. I've also *finally* been diagnosed as asthmatic after more than a decade of people assuming I was just faking/exaggerating chest pains and shortness of breath. :/ \n\nI also finally caved and started seeking treatment for joint pain.  I've had some issues for as long as I can remember. As a kid my ankles were always very weak and they and my jaw popped a lot.  As a pre teen I had occasional problems with my ankles and wrists. I had braces. As a teenager (19), I have pain in every joint you can name. Because of a family history of autoimmune disorders on my mom's side, we saw my GP who noticed hypermobility and did some bloodwork. It came back clean and we were then sent to a rheumatologist whose reaction was basically \"you *look* healthy what the fuck are you doing here\". She ordered more bloodwork (clean!) and diagnosed joint hypermobility.\nI've had a bit of PT for the hypermobility and I've just started trying out KT tape in the hopes it might actually help. \n\nSo why do I think Marfans might be in the picture? I have the hand signs - thumb folds past the pinkie, I can reach around my wrist with my pinkie finger and thumb.  I have a slight but noticeable outward curve to the manubrium of the sternum. I've been told I have long fingers but they seem fairly normal to me.  I've always been more or less thin but I grew up with 3 neighborhood kids who were chronically underweight (not starving!) so I've never seen myself as particularly lanky. I'm not exceptionally tall now, although I was the tallest kid through grade school, but not the oldest. I definitely dont look like a textbook example of Marfans. My dad, on the other hand, does.  He was tested and his heart is fine, so that is reassuring.  Unfortunately healthy heart = no marfans, according to that doctor.  so it's now \"impossible\" that I could have inherited it, according to my family.  I'm honestly a bit concerned about going forward without seeing if my heart is also not going to kill me any time soon.\n\nI guess the question is, is fighting my family and spending time and money on more doctors really worth it?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "sick of the diagnostic process, is one more round worth it?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/4khdiw/sick_of_the_diagnostic_process_is_one_more_round/"}, {"author": "HunterHyena", "author_created_utc": 1346902280, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_8x4d6", "created_utc": 1463114716, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/4j4r21/good_workout_routines/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4j4r21", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/4j4r21/good_workout_routines/", "retrieved_on": 1466449192, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I was curious, are there good workout routines for someone with marfans?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Good workout routines?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/4j4r21/good_workout_routines/"}, {"author": "gregoogly", "author_created_utc": 1463096896, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_xw240", "created_utc": 1463097609, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/4j3nh3/should_i_see_a_doctor/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4j3nh3", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/4j3nh3/should_i_see_a_doctor/", "retrieved_on": 1466448669, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hello everyone.

I'll try make this brief and not tire eyes, but will very happily clarify any points or answer any questions to help anyone kind enough to reply.\n\nI'm a 27/M in the UK.\n\nWhen I was around 18, while on an unrelated health checkup, my creepy GP became distracted by my hand resting on the corner of the desk, and began talking about its proportions and stroking my fingers. Creepy as hell, very unpleasant guy, but I'll spare you that story. After a while of quelling my gag reflex he had me stand up, suddenly excited and browsing through his little black book (that kind of GP - didn't like computers, in 2006), measured my arm span, gave me a general checkup, quizzed my mother about family history and excitedly expelled that he thought I had Marfan Syndrome.\n\nThis was very interesting not just due to the health risks it might prepare me for with relatively early detection if it were true, but because I'd had severe difficulties with school as I'd grown older due to debilitating pains in my hands when gripping a pen - something I'd long wondered about given my joint hypermobility (hand and fingers bend backward to create two right-angles, thumbs bend equally far in both directions).\n\nLong story short, I was assessed more professionally over a period of about a year, noting my extremely slim build compared to my arm span exceeding my height by three inches, my lack of weight gain, my very visible stretch marks on the sides of my hips and knees, my low spinal flexibility versus unusual digital/manual flexibility, my large and unusually flat feet, my high cheekbones and pronounced jaw, and the extreme (and mildly painful, at the time) clicking and crunching of most of my joints. Additionally, I experienced occasional but agonising and debilitating multi-hour cramps in my intercostal muscles and hips.\n\nThis added to the fact my maternal grandfather died of a massive heart-attack in his seventies - but his brothers and father all died before 50, suddenly, of same - however we lack medical data, as we're estranged from that family, and he was the youngest and last remaining male member of that unit when he died in the 90s. Additionally, he was extremely pigeon-chested, I'm told - seen without a shirt he was reportedly quite scary looking, with a projecting breastbone. A very proper man, I never saw him without a shirt myself as a child.\n\nNeither of my parents exhibit hypermobility, though my mother exhibits extreme back-pain, shoulder pain, and nerve issues around her spine ever since her teens. My sister is also clear of any signs.\n\nI was told \"you have Marfans\" for a long time, until eventually being told \"You have the signs but you don't have Marfans\", then the final test with the geneticist led her to flatly state I didn't, and would provide no further information or suggestions.\n\nSo it has been around ten years without any NHS provider being willing to look into this any further, and my extreme mobility in some areas and very low flexibility in others remains, while severe pain in my neck, back and shoulders has radically worsened, leading to reliance upon a private chiropractor and an NHS physiotherapist to try to reduce pain and regain or at least retain mobility. I've also had it confirmed that my poor vision is due to an uncorrectable tremor in my eyes - not something anyone but my mother noticed when I was a young child, and denied at the time by opticians, but randomly mentioned to me in my early twenties.\n\nProblem is, I can see triple, particularly in low light - distant points of contrast resolve into an at-times rotating triangle of blurred circles, and this is true even with one or the other eye closed, leading me to wonder what the hell has worked itself loose in there.\n\nI've studied MASS Phenotype, Ehlers Danloss and the rest of the spectrum of connective tissue disorders to the best of my ability (I've recently, finally been diagnosied ADHD as an adult, if you'll forgive that this ability can be limited) and remain fairly convincingly 'marfanoid', but not actually subject to that condition. In the absence of any further support, I'm at a loss for where to go next - I do not 'need' to know this, and am keeping an eye on my cardiac health as best I can regardless (as I also take medication for ADHD that stresses the heart, by necessity), but I'd love to know two things from those who suffer this specific condition, if anyone is able to offer answers;\n\n1) What other conditions should I look into in your opinion, if I am able to get into a dialogue on the subject with the health system again?\n\n2) How does genetic determination of Marfans syndrome work, and did the genetic testing merely tick one scoring criteria, or did it individually and certainly disprove the notion that I have Marfans?\n\nMuch appreciated, thank you =) ", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Marfan diagnosis/other connective tissue disorders", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/46pfv6/marfan_diagnosisother_connective_tissue_disorders/"}, {"author": "ThatFrankChick", "author_created_utc": 1452732202, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_trt0s", "created_utc": 1455755752, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/46c0v1/so_freaky_study_about_marfan_life_expectancy/", "gilded": 0, "id": "46c0v1", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 14, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/46c0v1/so_freaky_study_about_marfan_life_expectancy/", "retrieved_on": 1459194948, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So I was diagnosed at 18, just under a year ago, but haven't actually changed my lifestyle at all.

Which is apparently something people with Marfan's are prone to, but he didn't know that because he's never talked to a specialist about it. \"Oh yeah, I found this fact on the internet so I don't need a doctor since there is no cure\".  When he asked for a referral last week, his doctor was very vague and said he didn't know who would be on his insurance anyway.  \n\nWhich brings us to the present. It might be marfans, it might be one of the similar connective tissue disorders (a close friend growing up had one of the related disorders) but the point is that we're planning our lives together and I'd feel a lot more comfortable if I knew this problem was under observation by the right kind of specialist. I'm having trouble figuring out what that right kind of specialist is. Some google searches indicate a Rheumotologist? Or is the genetic counselor a better bet? We aren't planning to have children so that factor can be ignored. \n\nAny tips for finding the right doctor? This is clearly a stressful topic for both of us so anything that can smooth the way would be helpful.\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What kind of specialist to diagnose/handle Marfan syndrome?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/43okp6/what_kind_of_specialist_to_diagnosehandle_marfan/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1454142949, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/43dc88/anybody_else_have_unnaturally_dark_under_eye/", "gilded": 0, "id": "43dc88", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/43dc88/anybody_else_have_unnaturally_dark_under_eye/", "retrieved_on": 1455042973, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Anybody else have unnaturally dark under eye circles?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/43dc88/anybody_else_have_unnaturally_dark_under_eye/"}, {"author": "undrxpsd", "author_created_utc": 1445918687, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_rhuyu", "created_utc": 1454117169, "domain": "thekindland.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/43bzem/austin_carlile_on_treating_marfan_syndrome/", "gilded": 0, "id": "43bzem", "is_self": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/43bzem/austin_carlile_on_treating_marfan_syndrome/", "retrieved_on": 1455042340, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Austin Carlile on treating Marfan Syndrome symptoms with medical marijuana/CBD", "url": "http://www.thekindland.com/on-pain-and-perseverance-q-a-with-of-mice-men-798"}, {"author": "nobouvin", "author_created_utc": 1282861139, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_4a62w", "created_utc": 1453993922, "domain": "self.marfans", "edited": 1454068260, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/433o7r/hello/", "gilded": 0, "id": "433o7r", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 7, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/433o7r/hello/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "pdCOK65ycYXxnwLiB043kaEPZDRtH3T9AMlyPrCJrxw", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/rIwbZY9B_3M5Cg6tNW88gSnEcgmj-HOLojp4NptDBRs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=0f5be9c6f6bd825644e0c03361eb6bcd", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/rIwbZY9B_3M5Cg6tNW88gSnEcgmj-HOLojp4NptDBRs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=34bf61a742ef24e9f8db187287244bd5", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/rIwbZY9B_3M5Cg6tNW88gSnEcgmj-HOLojp4NptDBRs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=ecd9394bbe2070021611261d6f076b24", "width": 320}, {"height": 640, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/rIwbZY9B_3M5Cg6tNW88gSnEcgmj-HOLojp4NptDBRs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=1c4044f7ecbf2bf196d4ec1b1e5f076b", "width": 640}, {"height": 960, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/rIwbZY9B_3M5Cg6tNW88gSnEcgmj-HOLojp4NptDBRs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=b3876e0393f3317804a05adf49404c5d", "width": 960}], "source": {"height": 1024, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/rIwbZY9B_3M5Cg6tNW88gSnEcgmj-HOLojp4NptDBRs.jpg?s=ba341492fa6e23e4bd5423d00c2ccd88", "width": 1024}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1455038393, "score": 8, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I just discovered this particular subreddit, and thought it pertinent to introduce myself:\n\nI'm 44 years old, 191 cm, 90 kg. [picture](https://flic.kr/p/DpxCkw)\n\nI was diagnosed with Marfan at the age of three \u2013 a mutation, as none of my relatives are afflicted. In the early years, Marfan manifested itself mainly on my eyes, and I underwent eight? eye surgeries during my childhood, the end result being one eye prostheses (eye sight lost to slipped retina, recovery surgery unsuccessful) and one eye functioning (lens removed, slipped retina successfully recovered through surgery). Additionally, I underwent substantial teeth correction (including some surgery), have a high palate, and some pectus excavatum.  In my teens, I developed the classical build with long arms, legs, and hands. I did not participate in sports in my youth.\nI have participated in a fair number of scientific studies of Marfan in Denmark, and I am thankful that I have done so, as I, during the very first one in my mid twenties, was asked the crucial question \"how often is your heart scanned?\" My doctors had been specialists concerned with my sight, so none had thought to have my heart checked. That was soon rectified, and in 2001 my aorta had reached a diameter of 55 mm (the threshold at the time, though I believe it has been lowered since), and I underwent surgery getting a composite graft (and a neat ticking noise when my titanium heart valve closes). Since then I have been on medication with Marevan and Metoprolol. I am checked annually with ultrasound and MRI \u2013 everything is now rocksteady. I'm happy and relieved to live in a country with free, socialised medicine.\n\nFive years ago, I had a brush with death, as I developed [Endocarditis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis) \u2013 something to look out for, if you have an artificial heart valve. I spent six weeks in hospital getting in total around 25 liters of IV antibiotics. Now I know to contact my doctor, if I should developed a fever in excess of 40\u2103, and I have developed a hearty, if resigned, dislike for [venflons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula). \n\nTwo years ago, I participated in another study, this time focusing on the bones of Marfan people using high resolution CAT scanning. Turns out that our bones are not as strong as they might be, so I am now also on osteoporosis medicine.\n\nIn daily life, I suffer no major ill effects \u2013 my field of vision is too narrow for me to have a drivers' license, but I do not suffer from joint pain or similar, which I know can afflict others. I thought for quite a few years in my teens and my twenties that my life expectancy was 35ish (in hindsight, had I not begun having my heart/aorta checked, I most certainly would have been dead by 35), a fact that, while it may seem strange, did not affect me overly \u2013 I suppose I have a sardonic nature. Now, of course, my life expectancy is normal, which doesn't change my refrain at every birthday: Still Not Dead. I decided early on that I did not wish to sire children and remain single, which suits me just fine.\n\nIn my professional life, I hold a PhD in Computer Science and work as an associate professor at the largest Danish university. In order to keep in shape (and to strengthen my bones per doctor's orders) I run and lift every week.

I have been told on several occasions during dr checkups that I have an audible heart murmur. Last time I had an XRay for a digestive issue, I was told that I have scoliosis. Ive had persistent episodes of tachycardia since adolescence that have always been chalked up to anxiety (I wore a holter monitor that showed up palpitations but didnt seem to be of concern). I cant squat down or extend my shoulders without them loudly cracking and popping. I wear glasses, im not sure exactly what is wrong with my vision but I have multifocal lenses because my long and short distance vision are slightly screwy.

My grandfather had an aortic aneurysm while in his early 50's I believe. \n\nThe thing I hear most from doctors is \"You don't look like you have Marfan's\". Genetics are a strange thing lol. My mother and I both have the condition but it's manifested itself into very different way between the two of us. I'm tall but at 5'8\" I'm really just above average for a female and 'short' for someone with Marfan's while my mother is just shy of 6'. I have the long arms, legs and fingers however I've never been underweight or appeared bony; much the opposite I'm overweight with a very curvy, short torso. My mother was incredibly thin up until her mid twenties when hypothyroidism set in. \nMy heart seems to be stronger than my mother's, however I have asthma and her lungs are fine. We both had the lenses removed from our eyes when we were 15. In my case one of them was partially detached (there's a story about that if anyone is interested). I have a high, narrow palate that required surgical expansion when I had braces and deal with TMJ issues. \n\nWhile I was not allowed to play contact sports my parents encouraged me to be active in cheerleading and dance. I suffered quite a few injuries thanks to those loosey-goose ligaments but I'm a tough cookie. I'm grateful that my parents taught me that while I have restrictions there are still things that I can do. \n\nI have no idea if there's a connection but I also have fibromyalgia.

I went to a cardiologist, had an ECG(Echocardiogram) and a stress test performed. Both tests came back \"stone cold perfect\". I am a 22yo male. Just about 30mins ago I was in Dr. Paldeep Atwal's office where we discussed the features of a Marfan's patient among other related topics.\n\n   We did a few tests and I was found positive for about 6-8 of the physical features. However, because my ECG was normal months prior, and my eye sight is 20/20(as far as I can tell), he wouldn't diagnose me with Marfan's. I have a High palate, slightly sucken eyes, slightly recessed jaw and chin, the wrist and thumb test were positive (meaning I have longer than normal fingers), and my lower body to height ratio was .87 where as a normal ratio is 1. However, the lower body ratio was .6 - .7 points away from being positive, so technically I was in the clear on that specific test.\n\n   He agreed that I appear to have Marfan's on the surface, but obviously do not have any of the health side effects associated with Marfan's Syndrome. We talked about his studies -\n\n( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/?term=Atwal%20PS%5BAuthor%5D&amp;sort=ac&amp;from=/29700987/ac )\n\n - as well as some intricacies surrounding diagnosis of Marfan's Syndrome. Given my age(22), no aortic dialation, and no eye sight problems, he strongly believes that I do not have Marfan's. He alluded to the fact that I may be on the spectrum, but to no severe or life threatening degree. He mentioned that if I wanted to, I could have the Fibrillin1 Gene tested, but stated that it was just an option for clarity, and by no means a necessity. I declined.\n\n   I want people to know that roughly 2/3rds of patients with Marfan's Syndrome exihbit aortic dialation by the time they are 19 years of age. If you are a bit older, as in your 20s or 30s+, and you have no eyesight issues(near sightedness or other), no aortic dialation, but have obvious signs of Marfan's(regarding bone structure), you may not be in too much trouble. However, I must add that it is still possible to develop Marfan related health issues later in life, and that seeing a Dr is important to verify your condition. Nothing I've read explains this online, which is more than likely due to information being misconstrued, potentially producing false hope.\n\n   People must understand that it is possible to have the exact appearance of a person with Marfan's Syndrome, but not have it to a degree that would necessitate annual ECGs and other Dr visits. If you believe you may have Marfan's Syndrome, in my personal opinion, you should find a cardiologist near you that has experience with Marfan's patients, but if not, a regular cardiologist will suffice. You should ask to get an ECG done alongside a stress test. Marfan's Syndrome is one hell of a scary disorder, and my heart goes out to the lives affected by it. As far as looks go, I'm right there with you guys! Hell, I'm not 100% in the clear myself, as far as aortic aneurysms and eye issues go. \n\n   There's no telling what the future holds, but as of now I'll try to forget about Marfan's Syndrome and move on with life as usual. For those fighting Marfan's, or those helping family members through their fight with it, stay strong. There is a lot of ground breaking work being done by professionals like Dr. Paldeep Atwal(whom tested me earlier), and others alike. There is hope for the future of Marfan's patients and one day, it will be curable. \n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 473, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just Got Back From The Medical Geneticist / What I Wish I Would Have Known Prior To Visit", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/8g0mur/just_got_back_from_the_medical_geneticist_what_i/"}, {"author": "probablyparanoidmarf", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1524155784, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/8dg0uo/should_i_visit_a_doctor_or_am_i_paranoid_think_i/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8dg0uo", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/8dg0uo/should_i_visit_a_doctor_or_am_i_paranoid_think_i/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1524158131, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 0, "selftext": "Hey guys, I\u2019m 16/M. 60kg and 6\u20190.\nAfter a while of having different issues surround joints and bones, I think I might possibly have it.

I am thin but not extremely thin, in my opinion. I was always chubby as a child and teen till I changed my crazy eating habits and thinned out around 17/18 years old.

Nor is there a history of Marfans. \nI can do the wrist sign, but my the fist/thumbsign do not overlap unless I really force it, which hurts. I have long, thin fingers and a small wrist. \n\nI am very nearsighted and have been my whole life. I go to the eye doctor yearly and recently saw an ophthalmologist. Both have  never said anything was wrong with my eyes other than my poor eyesight and astigmatism. They just said I have an increased chance for retinal detachment because of high myopia. Do I have to mention to them to look for the lens problem? or would they just tell by doing eye exams? \n\nI have no heart problems I know of and have always had normal blood pressure, slightly on the lower side. I dont believe I have ever experienced heart palpitations. I mean, my heart beats really fast when I do cardio...but I feel like that\u2019s normal! \nNormal lungs, as far as I know. \nI think I had a slight scoliosis as a child, but nothing ever came up with it.

It doesn\u2019t bother me. I don\u2019t know if i have a high palate or not. My top teeth have always been straight. \n\nHowever, because of my long fingers/limbs, small wrists, and nearsightedness this is always in the back of my mind. \nI think my body looks proportional, but I never measured my wingspan or anything.  \nI can\u2019t afford to get a echo right now.

I just discovered this syndrome, and I've gotta say, it's pretty scary how much it reminds me of myself.\n\nThe shape of my hands is pretty weird, I've never seen anyone with similar looking hands ... until I discovered the Marfan Syndrome a few days ago.\n\nMe and a friend who works in a circus once compared just how flexible we both are, and I was actually doing more impressive stuff than her. I have never done anything that could explain why I'm so flexible, while she obviously trained a lot to be able to perform as she does.\n\nI don't know if it matters or not, but I can crack my fingers very easily, I can crack the area around my neck by accident, just by leaning my head to the right and to the left, and it makes a ton of noise. I can crack my legs by lifting it from the back with my hand, to the point where I could almost kiss my feet if I wanted to. \n\nMy skin is SO elastic it's not even funny, I can't count the number of times I've been nicknamed Luffy in conventions.\n\nFinally, my hands are ... not pretty, to say the least. All my fingers are sort of bigger in the middle. It's not really noticeable, except for the pinky of my left hand, which has gotten pretty huge. No one ever notices it, but when I put it next to the pinky of my right hand, it's insane how much bigger it is. I also realized that I don't feel much sensation at the tip of that finger. And at times, my fingers may hurt a bit. And my wrist is very, very thin. It's literally just skin over the bone. \n\nI pass extremely easily the whole \"wrist and thumb\" thing.\n\nOn the bright side, I'm only 5'7, which is a below average height for a man. I am thin though. My chest does kinda sink but it doesn't look especially weird as I've never worked out in my life, I don't have much of a chest so I can't really say.\nI did have a crowded teeth issue I had to care of with a dentist.\nAnd finally, I have stretch marks on my back, in the middle of it actually. It's been that way for years (I'm 21).\n\nI don't have any of the other symptoms (such as myopia, if anything my vision has always been diagnosed as perfect), but I suppose that I should still get checked.\n\nThing is, I'm kinda afraid to go to a doctor, and say \"Hi, do you think I have Marfan syndrome ? \".\n\nI don't want to be that guy that self-diagnoses himself conditions and then assume it just has to be the truth.

Thought I'd share the cardiovascular one since it's critical info. \n\nMarFact #6: We\u2019re going to spend the next few days discussing the ways that Marfan syndrome affects the body. Today we\u2019ll talk about the cardiovascular system. About 90% of people with Marfan syndrome have cardiovascular problems.\n\nMarfan syndrome causes aortic enlargement, and this is the most dangerous aspect of Marfan because it rarely has symptoms. The aorta is the main blood vessel coming from your heart. When it enlarges (aortic dilation), the walls of the aorta can bulge (an aneurysm), which puts you at risk for the aorta tearing (aortic dissection). That can be deadly (and dissection DOES have symptoms, but by then you\u2019re in an emergency situation). Again, there are rarely symptoms of aortic enlargement, so it\u2019s vital that a person who suspects Marfan syndrome have one of the following tests to assess their heart and aorta: an echocardiogram, a CT scan, an MRI, or a TEE. X-rays and EKGs will NOT diagnose an aortic aneurysm! \ufffd\ufffd\n\nLeaky/floppy valves, particularly the mitral valve (mitral valve prolapse), are another cardiovascular complication of Marfan syndrome. 60% of people with Marfan have mitral valve prolapse. Symptoms can include a murmur, palpitations, and shortness of breath. Severely leaking valves can lead to heart failure. Symptoms of heart failure can include a new cough, sweating, loss of appetite, shortness of breath (especially when laying down), and fatigue. Depending on the stage and cause of heart failure, it might be treated with medications or surgery. Rarely, Marfan patients may need a heart transplant. #KnowFightWin", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "MarFact posts", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/7w20hz/marfact_posts/"}, {"author": "Empire_of_light", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1517935932, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/7vonsm/happy_moments_topic/", "id": "7vonsm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/7vonsm/happy_moments_topic/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1517985172, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 3, "selftext": "Wouldn't it be nice to have a pinned topic with happy moments? \n\nLike the pics i saw in this sub of Marfan redditors playing music in a band, or the girl that went hiking after the operation.\n\nFrom my side i just slept like a baby for two hours at the hospital sofa.

So basically, my systemic score were 7+ which was a positive sign of Marfan syndrome. See systemic score calculation here: http://www.marfan.org/dx/score\n\nHowever, every time I tested for echo-cardiogram my heart has always been normal. I tested once or twice a year, and my doctor cleared me to lift heavy weights since my first echo. I had no family of Marfan syndrome as well, and no ectopia lentis (eventhough my eyesight is really bad). So I am not even sure if I have it or not since the doctor wasn't sure too, he just advised me to check up with my heart at least once every year. Another possibility I might have a mild form of Marfan.\n\nI am very active I have been lifting weighs regularly for almost 2 years, 2-3 times every week, and I have been consuming around 3500 calories per day on average. By lifting weighs, I mean really lifting heavy like 100+lbs bench press and such, not the Marfan definition of heavy like anything over 10 lbs. However I still weigh 160 lbs at 6'0, and my muscle tone is not that well defined for someone who has been working out for quite a while; and of course eating that absurd amount of calories.

I don\u2019t actually know if this is something I have but am feeling genuine concern over the amount of symptoms I have. I\u2019m sure you guys hear posts like this often, and I\u2019m not looking for anyone to diagnose me. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for, peace of mind I guess? Maybe I just need to get it off my chest. I can\u2019t actually see a Dr. until my insurance kicks in.  \n\nHere are the reasons I\u2019m worrying if anyone cares to know: \n- I have large hands for a female, my husband is 6\u20190 and while I\u2019m only 5\u20198 my hands/fingers are longer than his. Long very thin legs and short torso. \n- I have every wrist/thumb sign. Skinny wrists, can cover pinky finger with thumb. Can bend thumb downwards to touch wrist. Thumb extends past palm when making a fist/covering with fingers. All fingers seem double jointed. My hand/finger bones are like rubber in most places. I never thought too much of this until researching MFS and realizing I\u2019ve never actually met anyone else that can do these things. \n- I\u2019m underweight and can\u2019t gain no matter how hard I try. I\u2019m usually around 85-95 lbs but I\u2019m 5\u20198. My parents are thin people but were never close to this thin or boney looking like me. My siblings aren\u2019t either. \n- I have scoliosis (last checked 4 years ago was told it was mild) I have almost constant every day back pain, more so than would be normal for just mild scoliosis in my opinion. I can\u2019t stand up for long periods of time without pain that occasionally shoots to my legs. My back is in tons of pain just from quick grocery shopping. I also always feel fatigued. \n- I have a high narrow palette and long thin face. I breathe through my mouth only because my tongue cannot sit comfortably on the roof of my mouth to keep my mouth closed and breathe through my nose. Had speech problems as a child. \n- I have bad vision, am nearsighted. \n- I have downslanting palpebral fissures. \n- I have what I believe might be PE, have never paid much attention to it because boobs, but there\u2019s definitely a small indentation on my chest can push my thumb into it. \n- I get winded very easily, since I was a child, had a hard time running or doing anything too strenuous. More so now (but I figure it\u2019s worse now that I\u2019ve smoked since age 12 .. I\u2019m 25 now). \n- Hands and feet are always cold due to poor circulation (maybe also from smoking?)\n- I have stretch marks on my thighs and hips/butt and never gained weight rapidly to my knowledge. \n- I have never had my heart checked.  \n\nI\u2019m just extremely worried and frustrated that all my life I\u2019ve felt like I had a handful of issues/ things most people didn\u2019t have at my age or in general and never put any of it together like this. Sorry for such a lengthy post but it felt really good to write it all out instead of just going over it all again and again in my head.

I got an echocardiogram over the summer that revealed tricuspid and mitral valve prolapses/leakages, but no aortic growth *yet*. My primary care physician at the time was not at all knowledgeable in this disorder (he was clueless about it during our meeting, and then took out an outdated medical reference with the most extreme possible cases and went based off that) and merely dismissed the whole thing as me being a hypochondriac, despite both the prolapses and my *clearly* evident physical characteristics that would otherwise score sufficiently high on the Ghent criteria. Coming to graduate school, I met with a cardiologist on campus who specializes in aortic surgery, and has had at least some experience with Marfan syndrome. He looked at my physical characteristics and is pretty convinced I have it, saying it was a good thing I was resistant and continued searching for help lest I suffered the worst. He wanted me to have a CAT scan last week in order to get a more detailed look and to establish a future reference, but my insurance, provided by my university, is denying any claim due to bullshit policies so I can't afford it. I have to wait for further guidance and a plan of action from this doctor, but it seems like I won't have much access to health care lately due to the villainous insurance company (known among students here to be dangerously stingy).\n\nMy physical health isn't exactly the best. While I am blessed to not *currently* be stricken with ailments like arthritis and the like, my cardiovascular system isn't feeling very well. I used to be a distance runner, and while I was certainly no top-class athlete, I was still fairly good at it. Over the last year I made it a goal to start strength training (I wasn't aware of the whole Marfan syndrome thing at the time) to gain weight and look less weird. For the past couple of years, I suffered from orthostatic hypotension, which I had always attributed to anemia, which I had only a minor case of. Now, this whole thing makes more sense in the context of this disorder. It's making life very difficult. I'm almost afraid of getting up now because my heart beats so damn strong through my chest. Early morning when my alarm goes off and I get up to turn it off, even if I take my goddamn time, my vision goes out and my heart beats **incredibly** hard and it's scary. Often times, I just don't want to get up out of a sitting position. To make things worse, even changing sitting position from slouched to upright will cause this to happen, albeit not nearly as bad (but definitely noticeable and uncomfortable).  This alone is highly affecting me. Sometimes when I am studying, I like to go and write things on a whiteboard, but the transition from sitting to standing is enough to stop me from doing so. It's absolutely devastating watching myself go from someone who was so confident in their ability to be healthy through exercise, to someone who is so physically incapable of even basic tasks. Having absolutely no mass in some areas is also incredibly difficult. For example, my ass hurts so much from sitting *anywhere* because it's all skin and bone. Though I am scrawny as can be, I have ever only really been able to put on fat which never helps those areas. Sometimes it's gotten to the point where I can't even sit down because I have so many sores down there. Yeah, during those tough finals weeks where you can't sit down because the pain is excruciating (sometimes laying down hurt my back), but standing up is cardiovascularly a challenge can really bring you to tears sometimes. The little things in day to day life just pile on too. My height is 6'0/6'1 and my wingspan is around 6'6/6'7, and I have really long legs with a short torso. Things like desks and all were not meant to match these proportions. Busses, airplanes, office chairs, everything, just feels more difficult to be in because of it. No leg room, arms to long for certain desks, the list is endless; it sounds petty but it just piles on. Finding clothes that not only fit, but that don't make me look creepy, is a damn **nightmare**.\n\nAs awful as those things are, that isn't even the main point of this post. What's really getting to me is my mental health, which has seen a steep decline. I always had body image issues. I always saw myself as a bit awkward, and couldn't exactly pin down what it was. I was scrawny and had scrawny friends, but I didn't know why exactly I felt so weird when I looked in a mirror. Actually getting measurements of my wingspan/ and extremities, it all makes sense now, but it doesn't make me feel any better. In fact, before I always just scoffed it off as it all being in my head. Of course my mom would say that too (not very helpful considering that she is still in denial over me having marfan syndrome, that's her usual coping method), but now it's objectively disproportionate. It's frustrating that even others who I've seen with marfan syndrome don't have such a disparity between arm and torso length. Even when others have a big difference between *height* and wingspan, their torsos are at least a little longer and closer to the appropriate arm length and makes it at least a little less noticeable. Mine, however, is fairly easy to see. Instead of my hands/wrists reaching the crotch/butt area or just a little further, my goddamn *upper forearm* (part closer to elbow) passes that. It's such a fucking weird look, and I have grown to hate it to the point that I just can't bear to look at myself in the mirror. I get so anxious, and it could really ruin a huge section of the day when I catch a glimpse. My room has a giant mirror on the closet door, and I have to be extra careful to avoid looking at it when I need to get something from there. This isn't just exclusive to me. Other's have noted and commented on how weirdly lanky I am, including people like those I've had crushes on, to it hurt **extra** bad. I stay mostly on a large college campus now, but until just a few months ago, I was even afraid to go out places because random people would always fucking comment on me or say something. Also I have pectus excavatum, and to make things worse, I have horrific stretch marks all over me. I have more than my obese friend. I can't go to the beach, to the pool, or *anything* like that that. Outside of self image issues, having to stop the exercise I have been doing is absolutely killer. I have a sentimental value towards running. It helped through depression and was a huge symbol to me that I could accomplish things that seemed impossible at the time. I had always been the weak out-of-shape kid until I started running and became invested in health. I wanted to do the same with strength training but that is now all gone. My depression has become gargantuan and not a day has gone by since seeing the first doctor that I haven't sobbed heavily at least one point of the day. Some are going to recommend seeing a therapist, and I am working my damned hardest to make that happen, but I am **severely** limited in terms of transportation and finances. I am living literally paycheck to paycheck and things like debt mean my leftover funds after nonnegotiable bills and expenses is pocket change. I'm stuck and don't know what to do. It's been months since this whole thing started, and it's only gotten worse. I don't have many supportive friends. All the people I talk to on an intimate level are far, far away, and have been shockingly unsupportive and apathetic through this whole thing. My family is not very helpful either. My mother is in huge denial, is extremely controlling, and quite frankly does and says the most unhelpful things. I feel extremely alone during all of this, and my relationships have declined vastly. I'm sad all the time and mean/impatient to those around me. I have considered on multiple occasions taking my own life because I can't even get basic health care anyways. Part of me wishes I never came across this disorder, and that I stayed in the bliss of ignorance, that I stayed in a state where I could tell myself my distorted image is all in my head, that I'm getting out of breath easily because I just need to eat healthier or because I'm getting out of shape. I would much rather just have been ignorant, even if it means having my aorta burst one day, an excruciating sure, but quick death preceded by at least a better time. It's a raw deal that I'm 22 years old and already watching myself deteriorate.

I switched to yoga and green tea that helped some but as a med student there are days when a run and/or coffee are very necessary. I get anxious a lot and my primary care doctor recommended propanalol to help keep my heart rate down and it worked great. \n\nI used propanalol for the past year but I stopped using it a month ago after I took boards and hearing about how it\u2019s not good for long term use.

If I remember correctly, the doctor told my mom that I had small mitral valve prolapse.. now I could be wrong about the terminology but it was something about a small pin sized hole in a part of my heart (sorry about the lack of detail).

A couple years ago, I'd say when I was about 16-17 (I don't exactly remember), I went to have a checkup on my heart due to some issues I had with an eating disorder, and we wanted to of course check if anything went wrong. Despite already being thin due to crap nutrition, my pediatrician and cardiologists at the time brought up the possibility of coincidental Marfan Syndrome. It was quite confusing at the time because I displayed some, but not all signs. What I have:\n* Generally quite lanky. It isn't *too* bad, I could get away with just being a tall and thin guy with maybe a haunch of long arms, maybe a basketball player build, but you'd still think at least something was wrong because of thinness proportions (again, tricky because of past ed). My height is 6'1-6'2 and my winspan is around 6'4-6'6. My forearms and tibia just kind of seem to go a *tad bit* longer than you would expect\n* Somewhat hyper-mobile finger joints. I can do the finger swan, wrap my fingers around my forearms, bend some back, but not all and not to the text-book case degree. I have the long fingers.\n\n* Mild pectus excavatum\n\n* Stretch Marks. I was also a little chubby, more pudgy really, as a kid, and I think a few came from that, but most of it is height related from a really quick growth spurt. I was always one of the taller ones at school throughout the years, though some periods I would stall and then later catch up. I was a late bloomer in puberty, and the other pubertal changes also hit like a bus.\n\nThe specialists, however, said not to worry at the time because I didn't display all the features, and what I did display wasn't as extreme as many others that they knew had it. What I don't have:\n* Any eye issues whatsoever. \n* Heart issues from what they could tell years ago. No blood pressure issues either, though due to my current bad anxiety I measured today and got a reading of 134/69 which I think is higher than normal, but I don't check it regularly. At least no doctors brought something up when I went to a checkup. I do have othostatic hypotention (aka \"getting up to fast\"), but I usually attributed it to anemia and I honestly don't know how orthostatic hypotension plays into this.\n* Flexibility everywhere. Fingers and parts of my arm are basically where the lame party tricks end, everywhere else I am quite stiff. Can't touch toes, certainly no leg behind back of head, etc.\n* Marfan feet. I have big feet (size 13), but I have a high arch (which I liked for running of course) and my toes seem pretty proportionate and no issues whatsoever. No hammer toes etc.\n* Low stamina or energy. I can outlast anyone in terms of distance running, and I only suck at types of sports that involve things things I never trained for, like soccer with quick bursts of omni directional motion, but even then I'm not bad. I also recognize this isn't much help though because even athletes have died from this disease.\n* Scoliosis nor kyphosis. I apparently have a damn straight spine.\n*Any miscellaneous physical issues or aches like joints etc. I only have had tendinitis from over striding when running, but that's completely expected, and was greatly reduced when I recently fixed my stride.\n\nNow, none of what I just mentioned is in any attempt to deny anything. This is just why I was told to not worry about it back then. Furthermore, I saw some of these features in other people. For example, when I went to college I met two people with pectus excavatum (who were about my height), one with pectus carnatum, some with hyper-mobile fingers, some with similar height related stretch marks, and of course, some with crowded teeth. Hence, marfan syndrome completely went over my head and I didn't even think it was a possibility. I was fairly athletic (in a casual sense), and did distance running for years. I got in and out of strength training, trying to put on mass (I got stronger at times but I am a kept dropping and starting again due to lack of commitment and ~excuses~ school of course, I also felt like a hardgainer but that was also in part my constant hesitance to increase calories). In other words, I tried to be physically active, and more important to me, had the hope of being physically active and getting stronger/healthier, especially due to past ed. I just recently graduated college, and will be attending graduate school in 2-3 weeks.\nA couple of days ago, however, I came across many things about Marfan Syndrome, and it caught my attention again. While many cases where indeed visually extreme, there were a few I've now seen that look like me. I believe whole-heartedly that I do have the Marfan habitus/body shape, with worrying associated characteristics like mild spider fingers, general hand-signs, thin torso, pectus exc., etc. I have also seen about people who thought they were clear early on with insufficient testing, but they later suffered something like spontaneous aortic dissection. I have an appointment with a doctor this week, and will also be undergoing genetic testing. I am absolutely horrified at not only the results, but how this is going to affect my life. I won't be able to run (a major stress relief for me), I won't be able to strength train, and I won't be able to enjoy things like amusement park rides etc. I am terrified at the thought of an eventual heart surgery, terrified at the fact that my parents might outlive me, and terrified that if I do have it, I could have been susceptible to the aortic dissection this entire time, and there where times I physically pushed myself *hard*. Worse yet is the tease that I thought this was behind me, but apparently it isn't. I had a skin cancer scare (skin mark that turned out to be benign) earlier this summer, and it was really tough, but this just overshadows it. This whole episode is also confirming my body dismorphia, and I *know* I'm physically weird, and may not be able to do anything to improve it weight-wise. My anxiety has been so bad that I have to force food down and try not to vomit from nausea. I've been having constant panic attacks and don't know what to do. I'm sorry for the long post, but this is one of the toughest weeks of my life. I hate to sound like I've given up hope, but I think I should start trying to cope with the very plausible reality. If anyone can answer, what is the heart surgery like? It would be great if anyone can offer any general advice.

From there, healing has been FANTASTIC. All my nurses and doctors were very impressed with my recovery. \n\nThen this past Sunday, I had to return to the hospital due to chest pains. They found some fluid in my lungs and around my heart. Suddenly my great recovery was not so great.\n\nI was all cleared to go back for the fall semester, starting August 27. But now it seems it's better for me to hold off. I suppose it is better- my campus is a lot of uphill, a lot of walking. Walking around Walmart is even too much for me. \n\nBut my college is my home, my sorority is my family. It's a safe place for me, one I was counting on being in for the last 4-6 weeks of my recovery. \n\nMy dad just completely confirmed I won't be returning for the fall semester, and I'm heartbroken. I'm angry that this is happening to me, that I'm sick in the first place, that I needed this stupid surgery. I'm angry and upset and I just needed to rant/need some support. Also, maybe some other good reasons why staying home this semester will be good for healing, so I can reason this in my head. \n\ntl;dr: Surgery complications mean that my plans to return for the fall semester are now cancelled.

My Dad also has marfan and had to go through two surgeries as the first one didn't go well and it worsened his health... He almost died and this completely changed my family life as a kid. My Mum went through a serious depression and I was traumatized by the whole experience. My Dad's health is stable but not the best and he's getting older.\n\nI guess my case of Marfan is not too bad, I have a leak at my mitrale valve which apparently doesn't need surgery. However I often experience palpitations. I talked about it to my cardiologist a month ago and didn't seem concerned... It can really worry me though, it prevents me from sleeping as I keep worrying that there's something wrong with my heart and get really anxious. Sometimes I'm not sure if there are palpitations or I'm just feeling my pulse and my breast is fluttering. \n\nMy eyesight is pretty bad and I had to get laser done in one of my eye because of cracks in my retina if I recall correctly.\n\nIn general, I get tired easily and feel most of the time really lethargic. I'm also obviously really tall. \n\nMy chest is not symmetrical and I have a mild scoliosis, one side of my chest is out, the other one in, it's noticeable if I'm topless but it's not a huge deformity. However it causes me random uncomfortable chest pains.\n\nSo, adding to Marfan syndrome, I have PCOS, which is a condition affecting my ovaries. It causes hormonal issues, really painful periods, mood swings, difficulty to conceive a child, depression, weight gain and hirsutism.\n\nHaving marfan and pcos can really make me feel depressed. As a female I hope to one day have my own family. However, conceiving seems to be a real struggle. First due to Marfan, I've been warned that being pregnant puts your heart at risks. Adding pcos to that, the difficulty to conceive makes it seem a real battle with so many risks.\n\nI was wondering if any of you had these two conditions? \n\nOr if anyone wanted to talk about their pregnancy experience ? \n\nOr just anxiety associated with Marfan or other conditions. \n\nSorry if there's a lot in my post, I never talk about my conditions to anyone and vented a bit too.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 808, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Marfan and other health conditions (PCOS )", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565747786, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/conr4a/marfan_and_other_health_conditions_pcos/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "babbyhere", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2wsovsrs", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565336138, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/cnz1s1/face_fullness_in_marfans/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cnz1s1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/cnz1s1/face_fullness_in_marfans/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565336140, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hey there, general question about faces.

He was literally having sex after taking viagra, and collapsed for the first time. He was taken to the hospital but sadly the medical efforts weren't enough... he passed a couple of days after the incident. Heart failure.\n\nAfter the event, it was discovered that he had Marfans syndrome. Never diagnosed before. The follow-up to that was that earlier this year my mother finally took the dna exam. Today I learned that it was confirmed this past week that she also has the mutation. Which brings my brother (18yo) and I (26yo) to a 50% chance of having it (I believe that's how it works, right?).\n\nWell in my case symptons are the following: my severe myopia (that I have addressed with lasik surgery), countless cartilage and joint pain episodes (wrist, shoulders, knee, slight scoliosis). Dental structure problems growing up. My little brother, on the other hand, had only mild myopia, but is much taller and thinner than myself. He also suffers joint problems and also had his dental corrections at a young age (but then again, nowadays it seems like every kid had braces at one point). We have long limbs, long fingers. I have a big nose and big ears, just like my uncle had.\n\nWhat is killing me is that I have passions and my lil brother also has passions, that may have to be interrupted because of this potential diagnosis. We like to work out, I have recently picked up rock climbing and fell in love with it. I like running and hiking and swimming. The possibity of having marfans is giving me crippling anxiety, I have had 2 panic attack episodes (unrelated stuff) in the past and I'm scared that knowing about my mom's exam might spiral into another one. I fear for my brothers health, I fear about my future children which may also have a 50% chance of having the mutation.\n\nI'm trying to stay grounded until we both do our genetic exams and find out once and for all.\n\ntldr: uncle died from undiagnosed marfan. mom has confirmed marfan.

I DON'T have a deep voice for a 24 year old male, I have soft feminine facial features, I lack body hair, I have a curvy waist and wide hips, some people think I'm transgender or intersex. I'm just naturally like this. Trust me. Lifting weights isn't worth it. I was at a point to where I thought it could benefit me, now, I think, \"If people are not into my body, they can find someone else\". Because looks aren't everything, you don't need to impress people with muscles, but if you must, I think clothing is the best option to impress girls or whatever. Also don't let society force you to workout when you don't want to, because I was peer pressured a lot in my life to lift weights and be someone I was not. I think, as long as you eat healthy, that's all that matters. I think eating a healthy amount of food to survive is the best option. I remember just trying to lift weights just to see what it could do for me, all it did was give me a fast heart rate, pain in my chest, and one time there was an abdominal pulse, I never found out if it affected my aorta or not, I never bothered to check, but I guess it was a warning sign to just \"Quit it\". I know this will either get a lot of likes, or a lot of dislikes, not sure, it depends on people's personalities and their opinions, I'm not saying totally give up being masculine, unless you want to, but for me it's like, that stuff, that society alpha male stuff, never really interested me. I think, don't worry about how your skinny body looks, just as long as you eat healthy and your organs are all fine. You can still be attractive or strong in other ways. According to my doctor, when she tested my strength and pushed against my body and I had to push back, I was, according to her \"Very strong\", at least, with pushing stuff. You can be WHOEVER you want, you can have WHATEVER dream you want, just, if it costs your health, don't risk it, please. Sometimes I just get so mad and I throw stuff and sometimes I fear that might not be good for my health either, so please, take it easy.

At 23 my thoracic aorta spontaneously dissected (there was no dilation, no sign or symptoms that it could dilate or dissect.

So the remaining aortic tissue is dilating. And they're about 3cm (when they should be like 3 mm). My doctor is currently shopping around my case with different surgeons. He says this is a rare issue and may not find a surgeon willing to take on such a case. In the meantime I'm told to take as much beta blockers as I can handle.

Went on to Metoprolo for some time, and it managed to bring my heart to the much lower end of resting tachycardia and pretty much eliminated palpitations. Suddenly became \"intolerant\" of this medication and would up with a heart rate tanking into the low 30's. got off the meds and was at a comfortable 90 bpm at rest, however, any increase in activity would set it up into the 170's or higher.\n\nMost recently I have noticed that my heart rate is falling lower and lower over the last few months, now it is usually below 60 and I physically can not handle the side effects of this. I am currently wearing a heart bug to try and get some EKG's that may discover something. After 10 minutes of light cycling (not even out of breath, barely sweating), my heart broke past 195.\n\nHas any one else had some other issues similar to this? assuming IST is pretty common though.

Growing up I had concern with my penis being too skinny, as a kid I was very insecure and worried that it wouldn't be enough, or whatever 13 year olds think.  It eventually filled out and I have no problems with size.  I think it's average but my 5\"4 girlfriend usually says that it's \"plenty big and wouldn't be able to handle anything bigger.\". I think the skinny and long effect does make sex difficult at times when it hits her cervix.  So does anyone else have a similar experience?  I've never been able to talk about sex for Marfan syndrome people before, I've never even met another marf.  So I just wanted to find out if anyone else has a skinny dick like me.

I also have back pain The leg pain used to be only like once a month for just ONE day. This time it's been more than a day.\n\n-My shoulders go forward .\n\n-I am double jointed everywhere, no really I am. \n\n-My arms look kind of long. My toes are long too and I've been told my fingers are long.\n\n- I am very thin (I'm 95 lbs). ****important note, I am NOT tall. Actually I'm shorter than average I'm 5'3) but you don't HAVE to be tall to have Marfans, just a lot with it are.\n\n- I have flat feet.\n\n-My wrist are realllllly small.\n\nThe only thing I've had trouble with my heart is a benign arrithyma when I was younger.

I've been trying to find ways to cope, since I can't gain that much weight. I tried working out in the past but it wasn't a common thing, I only did it here and there, I think working out would be bad anyways due to the sensitivity of the aorta, plus, I'm not into working out hardcore anyways, I never really was, but I tried it out in the past on very rare occasions. I'm mostly into cardio. Also, I was always effeminate as a male, so I'm not into getting muscles anyways. I learned that's not important, eating healthy and eating enough is important, even though I can't gain that much, so, what I do is, I try to cover up my body with long sleeve shirts, even in the summer. Also, because I'm effeminate, I crossdress, in fact, it's the #1 reason WHY I crossdress, because society teaches you a man isn't suppose to be skinny and frail.\n\nSo I reject my gender role as a male or at least, as a masculine male.\n\nI think society forces men to be a certain way and if YOU wanna follow that role, go ahead, but I just don't BELIEVE \\*I\\* have to, but at the same time, I still try to be healthy with food. Again, I only care about food, NOT toughness.\n\nAlso I've made a few songs about Marfan Syndrome and issues relating to it, such as the aorta.\n\nI've been having heart complications in my young adulthood, however, no aortic dissection or rupture yet, just, other stuff like irregular heartbeats and palpitations.\n\nMy body made me not wanna gain muscle, however, I WANT to get more meat on my bones if that makes sense?\n\nLike, being muscle-less made me HATE the idea of getting buff, however, I'm not CAUSING my body to be like this, I just want more fat on me, not muscle.  \nI'm 108 pounds, and my dream goal is 150.\n\nI eat 3 to 4 meals a day, sometimes I eat 3 to 4 MEATS a day.\n\nSo, a quick recap: \n\n \u2022 I wear multiple layers of clothing to cover my body.  \n \u2022 I crossdress to cope with my weight. (I only crossdress at home and take photos online, kinda like an E-fashion model.)\n\n \u2022 I've made music relating to Marfan Syndrome and issues relating to it.\n\nNow I wanna know, what do YOU guys do to cope?\n\nIs it similar?\n\nOr different?\n\nMaybe I could try out your coping mechanisms, or you could try out mine.\n\nTake care.  \n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 677, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How I cope with Marfan Syndrome &amp; how do YOU cope.", "updated_utc": 1554497101, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/b89an3/how_i_cope_with_marfan_syndrome_how_do_you_cope/"}, {"author": "stimpy808808", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6ta01d1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1553999556, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/b7izwl/is_the_systemic_score_accurate/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "b7izwl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/b7izwl/is_the_systemic_score_accurate/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1553999557, "score": 5, "selftext": "hello. in the process of getting diagnosed with a connective tissue disorder and was wondering the accuracy of systemic score for marfans.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 672, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "is the systemic score accurate?", "updated_utc": 1554468781, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/b7izwl/is_the_systemic_score_accurate/"}, {"author": "rosami1234", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bk5gdb8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1553914510, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/b76ade/careers/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "b76ade", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/b76ade/careers/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1553914511, "score": 3, "selftext": "To my fellow Marfs- Just out of curiosity, what types of careers did you end up pursuing?

Please consult your cardiologist and/or family Doctor before beginning any new medication or supplement.\n\nPlease feel free to list what supplements you take but do not give recommendations on what someone *should* take.\n\nI am 30 year old Male with confirmed Marfan Syndrome with mild aortic root aneurysm.

Trans-Resveratrol - 1g every 2 days (I do one day on, one day off) dissolved in high fat yogurt.  \n*What is it? \"* Resveratrol is a stilbenoid, a type of natural phenol, and a phytoalexin produced by several plants in response to injury or when the plant is under attack by pathogens, such as bacteria or fungi. Sources of resveratrol in food include the skin of grapes, blueberries, raspberries, mulberries, and peanuts. \"  \n*Why do I take it?* Studies in Marfans **Mice** have shown that \"Resveratrol inhibits aortic root dilatation in MFS mice by promoting elastin integrity and smooth muscle cell survival\" Source:  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27283746/#:\\~:text=Conclusions%3A%20Resveratrol%20inhibits%20aortic%20root,strategy%20for%20patients%20with%20MFS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27283746/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20Resveratrol%20inhibits%20aortic%20root,strategy%20for%20patients%20with%20MFS).  \nIf you are curious about trans-resveratrol, watch videos of David Sinclair explaining its effects: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vcF0C2cZI8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vcF0C2cZI8)   \nIt is important to note that I only take trans-resveratrol, as cis-resveratrol is not easily absorbed. Most supplements are cis-resveratrol. I take the DoNotAge pure resveratrol brand. Trans-resveratrol should be taken with fat such as yogurt.  \n\n2. Ashwagandha - 600mg/day  \n*What is it?*  Ashwagandha is an ancient medicinal herb which seems to reduce cortisol levels and provides and anti-anxiety effect.  \n*Why do I take it?* I take this to mainly help with my anxiety and depression. I have found it to personally be more effective than taking an SSRI and it has improved my sleep quality.  \nIf you are curious about Ashwaganda, check for brands that are KSM-66.   \nStudy: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-research-shows-high-concentration-ashwagandha-root-extract-can-be-an-effective-sleep-and-anxiety-aid-300934783.html#:\\~:text=Those%20who%20consumed%20KSM%2D66,a%20greater%20feeling%20of%20ease](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-research-shows-high-concentration-ashwagandha-root-extract-can-be-an-effective-sleep-and-anxiety-aid-300934783.html#:~:text=Those%20who%20consumed%20KSM%2D66,a%20greater%20feeling%20of%20ease).  \nAshwagandha has been shown to be safe for short term use, although long term safety is unknown.  \n\n3. Coenzyme Q10 - 200mg/day  \n*What is it?* Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) is an antioxidant that your body produces naturally.  \n*Why do I take it?* CoQ10 has been shown to improve symptoms of congestive heart failure.   \nPeople with cardiac disorders have been shown to have significantly lower levels of CoQ10.  \nStudy: [https://www.jtcvs.org/article/S0022-5223(94)70477-5/fulltext](https://www.jtcvs.org/article/S0022-5223(94)70477-5/fulltext)  \nCoQ10 has additionally been proven to be generally safe.  \n\n4. Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) \u2013 1g/day in mornings.  \n*What is it?*  NMN is made from B vitamins in the body, and is a molecule naturally occurring in all life forms.  NMN elevates levels of NAD+, which declines with age.  NMN may aid in rejuvenating our mitochondria.  \n*Why do I take it?* NMN has been studied extensively in animals and has shown incredible anti-aging effects, but it has not yet been studied as much in humans. I believe NMN could have a anti-aging effect on the heart and blood vessels.    \nWatch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0tEQyVDsAc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0tEQyVDsAc)  \n\n5. Vitamin D3 - 125mcg.  \nBetween 70%-97% of Canadians may have some vitamin D insufficiency, studies are beginning to show that Vitamin D may be crucial to protecting against COVID-19. Vitamin D is actually a hormone and we only get about 10% of what we need from our food, the rest the body creates from when sunlight hits our skin.  \n*Why do I take it?* Some studies have shown that Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for heart disease.\n\nThis is my main supplement routine. I also try and get plenty of light exercise and 7-9 hours of sleep.

Anyway, the problem is that I really have serious anxiety about doctors. Even just ringing up to book the appointment makes me feel physically sick. This also isn't helped by a very bad experience I had a while ago where one particular doctor made me feel so awful about making an appointment for some cardio issues I was having, refused to book me in for tests and then actually told me that I was too young to have anything wrong with me.

I felt like I was already missing out on many things I'd love to do because of my Marfans. So why not try to go and start something I was always recommended to do but never did out of fear?\n\nI'm still trying to embrace and accept my body as it is. It's tough, but I'm trying to accept the fact that a radical change would be only possible if I was born again...\n\nSo I went and bought myself some training swimsuit. Kinda tight, but that's okay.

You basically shorten the span of your ulnar border as the little finger is pushed over more and more over the thumb. The thumb is still in the same position (maximally pushed into the palm).

marfan syndrome.\n\nThought I'd check back and give you guys an update. I really appreciate how supportive and reassuring you were before. I know you all get a bunch of these posts and they must drive you up the wall by now but it's a good source of comfort.\n\nI went to my general care doctor the other day and explained my worries. I said I wanted to get screened for Marfan and we did a quick examination. My fingers are hyper mobile and I easily pass the wrist test. I have long fingers and thin wrists. I'm also pretty skinny. I've always had trouble gaining weight.\n\nOr well at least until last year. I'm 5'10 and bulked up to about 140 after having weighed 115ish most of my life but I'm back down to 121. Which is probably because I haven't been eating as much as usual in quarantine and not exercising like I should.\n\nAnother thing we took note of was my severe myopia and astigmatism. Although I've never had a dislocated lens and bad eyes run in the family. As do crowded teeth coincidentally, which I also have.\n\nSee what gets me is I fit the bill for the stereotypical marfan diagnosis. Bad eyes, long fingers, super skinny; but I scored pretty low on the Ghent criteria.\n\nLast time I posted I mentioned I have flat feet, which isn't true come to find out. My feet are normal. My fingers are long but I can't pass the thumb test (but I heard most marfans can't pass the test while reading something online?) My arms are longer than my height but the ratio comes out to only 1.02- 1.03ish if I remember correctly. My lower segment is longer but not enough to meet criteria. No scoliosis.\n\nI don't have any rib cage deformities aside from a lone protruding rib on my right side. It's fairly subtle and doesn't effect my breastbone aside from a slight bump where it connects. We weren't 100% sure if that would count as a point towards chest asymmetry or not since the criteria states \"extends beyond normal variation\"\n\nWe couldn't do any of the criteria that required X-rays but I've never had any pain suggestive of Dural Ectasia or Protucio Acetabulae. I used to be an avid golfer and never had any problems with my hips and occasionally I'll get a really dull pain in the bottom of my back but only after sitting for quite a long time or something similar. Not a common occurence.\n\nI don't have skin striae. She listened for a murmur but didn't hear one.\n\nWhen it came down to it, my Ghent score was a 2 or 3 depending on whether you counted chest asymmetry.\n\nBut she scheduled me for an echocardiogram and an EKG this week. She said she didn't think the insurance would cover it on just the basis of a test for marfan but because I'd had palpitations in the past, they would cover it for that.\n\nI believe my palpitations have just been from stress though. They always coincide with stressful events in my life and I rarely have them when I'm stress free. Never been diagnosed with a murmur.\n\nI've had an EKG a few years ago that came back normal. I've had a chest xray in 2018 that's come back normal too. I'm not sure if Aortic dilation would show on a chest xray but it's my understanding that a lot of marfan cases are picked up with routine chest xrays?\n\nAnd I know this sounds like another diagnosis post but I promise its not that. I'm just looking to vent I guess? I've probably read 1000 posts like this one on your sub this past week because I can't stop stressing about it. Waiting for the echocardiogram has me so scared. I can't shake the feeling I'm only a few days away before being faced with the fact I'll need heart surgery. A few days away from my life changing forever.\n\nAnd I just don't know what to think? One minute I'm thinking \"Bad eyes and teeth run in the family, you score pretty low on the Ghent score, you can't do the thumb test, your chest xray came back fine; you're just overreacting\" and then the next \"How can I not have it? I have severe myopia, I've always been skinny, my ankles used to hurt when I ran track, I fit the bill for the stereotypical Marfan case, I definitely have it.\"\n\nAnd I know I can't find that out until my echocardiogram on Wednesday but man this sucks. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about it. Even if I try, no one understands.\n\nMy family keeps trying to be encouraging and reassuring me I don't have it but I don't know what to think. It's so overwhelming and it makes a person feel so alone.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1196, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hello Again", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/ibnz95/hello_again/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "seeeeeeeeeeeeeeen", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5cqg2hxl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597672384, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/ibejam/physicaloutdoor_jobs_for_person_with_mild_heart/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ibejam", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/ibejam/physicaloutdoor_jobs_for_person_with_mild_heart/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597672394, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm just wondering what my options are for doing a physical job as the idea of being stuck behind a desk doesn't apeal to me.

Just scared and wanted \nopinions.\n\nShould say both of my parents are pretty skinny and bad eyesight runs on my moms side. My mom is short but I\u2019d say my dad is about 6 foot or a little taller. He\u2019s 48 so I guess if he had marfans he\u2019d most likely know. Forgive my ignorance if I\u2019m incorrect on that. \n\n19 YO Male \n\nNot sure exactly on height but around 5\u201910-6\u20190\n\n125 lbs- weighed 135 a few months ago but quit soda and have been going through a lot of stress.\n\nPoor posture (Not sure if that matters)\n\nBad Eyesight I wear Contacts - Runs in my family and not sure if my lenses are dislocated.\n\nVery skinny arms and legs. Bird legs and the top of my wrist is only about 2 inches wide. I\u2019d say I have long limbs (the tip of my middle finger is about 5.5 inches above my knee, that may be common idk) but my body doesn\u2019t look disproportionate (atleast not obviously)\n\nCrowded molars - Flossing is very tight. Not sure if that\u2019s common for back teeth  in the general population though. \n\nHave stretch marks on upper thigh/hip area. \n\nFlat footed. \n\nMight have high palate not sure how that is determined. \n\nI actually went to my GP the other day and got a echocardiogram that I am awaiting the results for. ECG was normal. I went due to anxiety related chest pains (atleast I think) as I have bad health anxiety and have had a host of somatic symptoms since the start of quarantine. My GP was familiar with Marfans but he wasn\u2019t entirely too concerned. He said if the echo comes back normal I don\u2019t need testing, and he said he knows what to look for on the echo. I\u2019m not sure if he looks at it or if it is sent to a cardiologist or something. But with all of my symptoms and reading how heart related issues can show up later and very fast I was wondering if I should push for the test. For those who have done the test is it very expensive? Is it accurate? Does it test for other connective tissue issues as well? \n\nSorry for rambling guys I\u2019m just pretty nervous about this. Any feedback would be appreciated.

Unfortunately, and I really stress the *unfortunately* my parents decided not to correct it when I was a kid after a dr. pointed out that it could and should be corrected. My parents figured that since I'm a female that eventually breast development would cover it all up, so no point in surgery. Although being a female deff aids with covering it up, which I can attest to; it's still a mess cause so much of half my chest is higher than the other. This goes beyond my sternums unevenness as most of my ribs are higher on 1 side. \n\nTo get to the point, I'm back in my home city after being away for 3 years at Uni and I'm going to see my GP this week. So ofc, now is the time to bring up any surgery queries. In seeing her I may just ask to have a referral sent ovr so that I can see a surgeon abt this in the near future - no rush cause of covid ofc. \n\nAnyway, I wanna hear about any of your experiences and if you rlly think surgery for pectus is worth it? Since I have pectus carinatum and not pectus excavatum (which is when the chest is shaped inward*) its not interfering with my breathing and general health. \n\nI really dont mean to come off as superficial seeing as this is not a detriment to my current health, but for those of you who have had, or still have severe pectus you kno where I'm coming from, and likely know how I feel.\n\n*this final point is more for the ladies, - I've figured the only other option to achieve an even chest would be getting a breast implant on the right side where there's not as much volume. If any of you ladies had done something like that, I'm curious to know how that went and if you would recommend it?

I was abroad in a country without great medical facilities and thought about coming back to the UK because it was weighing on my mind and I wrote on this forum about it. Anyways, long story short, I did come back. Went a&amp;e and the doctor said 1. You have gerd (someone actually suggested this on the post I wrote, so you were right!), and 2. That I did have a lot of the signs. I went to my gp who checked me and said I had all the minor signs but I needed to be checked for the major ones, so he sent me for a heart scan and a transthoracic echocardiogram. I went to the latter today and I\u2019m so stupid I never asked the sonographer any questions. They mentioned at the beginning that I\u2019d have to wait for the results so I assumed only a doctor would be able to check it or something? Anyways when I left, I got this weird vibe like he knew there was something wrong. I wanted to ask, how have scans gone for people, did you ask questions from people who weren\u2019t doctors and have they confirmed or denied anything off the record.

I've been closely monitored since I was 12 and a problem I have is mitral valve prolapse causing mitral valve regurgitation. \n\nIn the last week ive been feeling a bit unwell, like it's been extra effort to get dressed and have a shower in the morning and I've just started a new office job with 2 really lovely team members. But going into the office this week I've been feeling nauseous and had cold sweats. I've also noticed a slight discomfort in my chest. Anyway I'm not asking for medical advice because I've already been in touch with my cardiologist and we have a plan of action. \n\nMe being me however I've been catastrophising, looking at survival rates for mitral valve repair/replacement and aortic root replacement. And from what I've understood, after primary operation the expected survival rate is around 10 years. With me being 24, I'm thinking that's obviously not great.. But then I've also read that people with Marfans have a normal life expectancy so I don't know what to think but I'm leaning towards thinking negatively.\n\nIn previous chats with my cardiologist he said that if I need surgery on either my mitral valve or an aortic root replacement he will do both surgeries at the same time which in my eyes reduces my expected survival rate further. And I also have a sunken chest so I'm guessing that would complicate things further?\n\nI'm due an echo soon anyways, but I'm also a bit unclear on whether my echo tells us anything anyway. Because when I was under the childrens department, my mitral valve prolapse was classed as mild. But as soon as I transitioned to the adult department the reference measurements changed and it was then classed as moderate. And then the next scan, the technicians report said it was severe. But my cardiologist after reviewing every scan says there's little change. So I don't know how bad my mitral valve even is from the echo.\n\nAnyways, that's kind of a summary of my situation and if I'm honest my mental health isn't that great right now thinking about all this.. So I was just seeing if anyone can give me any good news, or a better perspective. Like have I misunderstood survival rates? Or, I can't see how, but maybe open heart surgery isn't that bad? \n\nTLDR: Worried that I might need open heart surgery soon in my mid 20s, feeling like I'm going to die young, does anyone have any words of wisdom?\n\nThanks for listening anyway! It's been nice to write down my worries at least, even if nobody reads this.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o",

Mostly because I'm worried the same will happen to me.\n\nI want advice from this community. So please bear with me. \n\nI recently learned about Marfan syndrome and began thinking what if that's what my dad had. And so I know people here are not doctors but I thought of asking if it's worth seeing a doctor anyway.\n\nSome facts about my father: he was tall, hypertensive, had heart palpitations. But he was also obese, a smoker, and not very active. And so I wonder if it was undiagnosed Marfan or an unhealthy lifestyle. Otherwise I don't know that he had any other signs of Marfan.\n\nMe: I'm a tall somewhat thin dude, 27 years old. I'm 6'4\", 230 lb, but most of my fat deposits in my lower half. My arms are skinny. But I have a belly, big butt, and thicker thighs. \n\nI'm pretty sure I do not have either the wrist or thumb sign. \n\nI'm nearsighted, but only slightly, with astigmatism in one eye. \n\nAnd most recently I learned that my overbite is due to a small lower jaw. That's what ticked me off and that's why I'm here to see if yall have any advice.\n\nI'm not aware of other issues so far.\n\nDay to day I feel fine. I run a couple times a week. I have some back pain from bad posture but nothing that can't be mitigated with some core workouts.\n\nSo... is it worth going to the doctor for a check?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false,

Let me start off by saying this is not a \"do i have this??\" question but I'm asking this mostly out of curiosity than anything, and also because I want to get some things straight from those who know more than I do.\n\nI have never once heard of this syndrome before a couple of months ago when my coworker mentioned I look like her son who has marfan's. After doing a bit of research my heart goes out to all of you who have been officially diagnosed with it :(\n\nI've always been of above average height and low weight pretty much until my late teens. I'm 5'9 and 160lb currently but before that I used to be constantly around 115-120lb, pretty much looked like a stick figure. I can easily pass the wrist test. I've had stretch marks all over my lower back for years and years but I never thought much of it.  My wingspan is 1:1. I'm nearsighted to a fault and my joints pop and ache constantly. But those things aren't really my concern. The thing that most concerns me is I've always had mild heart problems since I was a kid. On my last exam (2 years ago @ 18yr) they noted that I am starting to develop MVP. I haven't had any tests done since. My aortic root was 24mm at that time for reference though, as opposed to 21mm a couple years before. I guess what I'm questioning is whether or not I should consider my heart issues being related to this?  I'd like to bring up this topic to my PCP but they are booked out until May because of the pandemic :( Sorry I'm not trying to look for a diagnosis or medical advice, moreso just curious if I might want to consider a future echo until I can see an actual professional and ask them.

Because of those scars anytime we are in a car he has a lot of discomfort especially on rough road and when we hit bumps. I try my best to keep it as smooth as possible but our city has god awful roads. Has anyone else experienced this after surgeries and have any recommendations? We try to have him hold a pillow and it helps a little bit but not much.

I\u2019m 32, and for all intents and purposes, I thought I was fine, just extremely unfit and lazy. Then someone took a photo of me and I looked so narrow and my arms looked so long, that I just googled \u2018long arms\u2019 and the first thing that popped up was Marfan syndrome. I had a lot of the symptoms: bad eyesight, stretch marks, small jaw, crowded teeth, flat feet, the ability to do those hand tests, a not straight back (can\u2019t say what it is for sure, so won\u2019t label it). Then not even two weeks later, my chest hurts so bad it feels like it\u2019s going to explode, every time I got up I felt like I was going to faint and die, my throat felt like it so sore for some bizarre reason. I never went to the doctor because I was abroad in a country without good medical facilities. The pain eventually went away and I sort of forgot about it (I have some life stresses so I have other things on my mind). Now my chest pain is back and it\u2019s not as severe as the last time, but it\u2019s worrying and I keep hearing a burping/bubbling/whooping(?) sound in my chest. It\u2019s like if I had a bottle of cola, and I tipped it upside down, all the bubble that start to go up is what what my chest feels like. My ticket back to the uk is in a months time, but I\u2019m thinking of pushing it forward to go to the doctor, I would love to know for people who felt weird, what signs scared them enough to seek help. I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m being paranoid but I hear that my age is crucial point if you haven\u2019t been diagnosed yet. Any info on any internal signs that others have had would be greatly appreciated. Thank you :) \n\nPs: I\u2019m 5\u20195 but people think I look taller, my weight has fluctuated my whole life, I\u2019ve been rail thin and overweight. No matter my weight I have excess fat on my arms.

I first learned about it 10 years ago when reading about my chest deformity. As you can imagine, it scared the hell out of me. Went to my primary doctor and they ordered an echo which came back clear. I had another echo at 24-years old for an unrelated issue. All that was found was mild mitral valve regurgitation or something like that. Nothing crazy.\n\nNow here I am 6 years later, and the thoughts have been popping up again. A Google search turned up that heart issues may not show up until much later in life, and now I'm freaking out again.

Sternum sticks out and the sides cave in.\n* Positive wrist AND thumb sign\n* Mild scoliosis\n* Stretchy skin\n* I had some stretch marks on my lower back when I was a teen. They've faded.\n* Pretty loose joints, but mostly in my left arm. Dislocated my elbows a few times as a kid. Joint pain as well.\n* Skinny.\n* High palate. Though, my teeth aren't crowded because I'm missing a tooth and that created space.\n* Map Dot Fingerprint Dystrophy. Not associated with Marfan's, but it's an eye issue that popped up.\n* deep set eyes\n* Regular low back pain.\n* small/recessed jaw\n\n**What I don't have:**\n\n* Flat feet\n* no dislocated lens as far as I'm aware\n* I don't have reduced extension of the elbows. If anything, they hyperextend.\n* My arm span doesn't exceed my height, if I measured correctly. I believe the ratio is .97.\n* I'm not taller than most people in my family.

As scary as it sounds, it does have a lot of research behind it, and seems to be the optimal way of gaining muscle mass for people with a heart condition. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this type of workout? Would love to hear some opinions or experiences.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1656,

Also I do not have a 100% diagnosis like genetic analysis\n\nI have had a lot of issues with exercise and would love to hear other people's thoughts\n\nI am 21, tall (5'11) and skinny. Like many here I wanted to gain weight. I started going to the gym 3x times a week and eating a caloric surplus \\~3000 while carefully recording.  This is actually a lot of food and much more than many dudes eat.  I managed to go from 135-&gt;150lb in a couple of months at about +1lb/wk. I felt great and felt better about my appearance too.\n\nI never really noticed much change in muscle.  I noticed lots of knee clicking during squats, collarbone slipping during bench press, and back pain while doing curls.  I always tried to be super safe, used proper form and even switched to alternative exercises.\n\nStill things didn't work out too well. A few months in, I started getting bad pain near the stomach. This was bad enough to wake me up in the morning and keep me up at night. It turned out I had developed a duodenal ulcer.  I went on triple therapy (very strong medications) to get rid of h.pylori and then for a few months used proton pump inhibitors. Felt terrible the whole time with pain and the meds led to gas and nausea. Nonetheless, I managed to get through exams and classes and do fine.\n\nMy ulcer soon healed and things were looking better.  I think even though its needed for weight gain, eating a lot caused the ulcer. Perhaps there was more acid produced or maybe the sphincter leaving to stomach was weak. This kind of puts my dream of gaining weight  to an end. I lost all the weight I gained over the due to the whole ordeal (back to 130) and wont be bulking again. \n\nA couple months later I started experiencing pain above the stomach. After an endoscopy, it was confirmed that i had now had a hiatal hernia. This is when the connective tissue of the diaphragm weakens and the stomach bulges through.  Now i have some acid reflux pain randomly (minor compared to the ulcer) but need to sleep on 20cm elevated bed and greatly change my lifestyle. Fatty and spicy foods are uncomfortable but I cant eat large portions nor stay hungry as both are painful. I also need to eat dinner 3hrs before sleeping and drink no more liquid after that time. Hernias are not really solvable without surgery and I need to learn to live with these stomach issues.\n\nLife isn't terrible, but I definitely get jealous/angry seeing all the muscular dudes out there. But you learn to accept it. I would recommend finding friends who are supportive and having supportive family also helps. For me the worst part of was that my mom would still bring up being skinny on a regular basis and keep telling me that most of my issues are \"non issues\".\n\nThanks in advance for any advice and I would urge everyone to be really safe about exercise.

I wanted to share my full story with you since I have had a lot of people asking me.\n\nA few years ago I posted a GIF of my eyes on Reddit that went viral - I still see the GIF floating around on social media:  [https://redditblog.com/2015/11/03/redditor-with-marfans-syndrome-shares-a-gif-of-his-quivering-iris-and-everyone-freaks-out/](https://redditblog.com/2015/11/03/redditor-with-marfans-syndrome-shares-a-gif-of-his-quivering-iris-and-everyone-freaks-out/) \n\nI was born premature at 31 weeks (just a little over 2 months early). I was a very long baby and only weighed 4lbs. At 3 years old my parents were told I had dislocated lenses in my eyes which caused me to be severely nearsighted and that I probably had Marfan Syndrome. Though through childhood echos on my heart didn't show any major abnormalities, I was never able to fit the clinical criteria until recently. I was always told that I had \"Suspected Marfan Syndrome\", but now finally the clinical diagnosis is there. I've taken a genetic test for Marfan Syndrome and related disorder, but am still waiting to hear back from CHEO Genetics Clinic in Ottawa. \n\nNobody in my family besides me, is exceptionally tall or has had Marfan Syndrome or Aortic disease or any connective tissue disorder. I was tested and do not have Homocystinuria.\n\nI did not previously fit the clinical diagnosis because I did not have enough of the signs according to the geneticists that I've seen to have a high enough systemic score according to the Ghent criteria, which is one of the ways how Marfan Syndrome can be diagnosed.\n\nI am tall (6'8\") and was always lanky as a kid and teenager, but now have put on a good amount of muscle and weight and weigh around 230lbs. I do have a little bit of a high arched palate in my mouth. I have disproportionately long arms (about 7ft span). I have stretch marks all over my body, especially shoulders, belly and back. I was just this year diagnosed with a very mild obstructive sleep Apnea because of poor nose breathing (due to Nasal Valve Collapse and Deviated Septum). My family doctor had a hard time believing me that I thought I had Sleep Apnea, but they did not know that tall people or those with Marfan Syndrome are at a much higher risk for this. I finally went to a Sleep Apnea clinic in Winnipeg and it was confirmed.\n\nI never really showed having the thumb or wrist sign of Marfan Syndrome (maybe if I push really hard my thumb can stick out just barely). I don't have flat feet, no chest deformities. No obvious facial features. No overcrowded teeth. I only found out in my mid 20s that I had very mild scoliosis, so we aren't sure if it was present at birth. My elbows do have slightly reduced extension. I don't have joint dislocation problems (hyper-mobility) or stretchy skin. I've never had chronic back or joint pain.\n\nI do have some Eustachian Tube Dysfunction, especially in my left ear, it is impossible for me to pop my ears and has always been this way, and it results in occasional Tinnitus and pressure/full feeling in my ear. This is one of those things that is common in Marfan Syndrome but is not well known.\n\nIn 2011, an echo of my heart showed that my Aortic root was still within the upper normal range. An official diagnosis could still not be given, though I was treated as though I had Marfan Syndrome and had an echo mostly every year, though I did go some periods with not having one for 2 or 3 years.\n\nGrowing up for me was especially difficult, not physically, but emotionally, as some of my earliest memories are how I had flown to Toronto to see Cardiologists and Geneticists. At this time in the early 1990s, the outlook for Marfan patients was not nearly as good as it is today, and I had mistakenly believed as a child that I would not live past 30 years old. This was of course, an incorrect belief on my behalf, because the data around that time had shown that if Marfan Syndrome was left untreated, patients would have a shorter life span. As a young child, I was always aware of the horrifying reality that I could possibly die at a young age.\n\nI was always the tallest person, not just in my class but in my entire schools (except for maybe my first few elementary school years), and it was always demanded of me that I played sports. But I didn't. I was never on a single team in high school, although I did bowling as a kid. This was partly because of a mistaken belief that I had that people with Marfan Syndrome could not play any sports, which is really not true, though it varies on patient by patient basis and generally high risk full contact sports should be avoided, and partly because I just didn't really have an interest in many sports. I still meet people nearly every day who ask me why I am not a pro basketball or volleyball player. \n\nDuring my teens I started to randomly develop strange panic attacks. They would begin with me feeling very cold, and then my entire body would start to vibrate and then shake uncontrollably. I was hospitalized multiple times and given Benadryl and Oxygen to calm me down. I had never heard of panic attacks and had no idea what they were. I became quite depressed, and was prescribed SSRIs (Celexa), they seemed to help a bit and I was on them for years.\n\nI've read a book on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy called *Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy*, which has definitely helped with depression and anxiety. I highly recommend CBT if there are people struggling with depression, anxiety or unrealistic thought patterns.\n\nI seem to have mostly outgrown my panic attacks, though still occasionally can get one. I did eventually notice a semi-pattern with them, they would always start with me feeling cold, even if I was having a very good day and had absolutely no anxious or depressive thoughts. I would notice my veins on my hands and arms would always disappear and I would test my blood pressure in these times, my blood pressure would be higher than normal. Moderate intake of caffeine or other stimulants seem to have a stronger vaso-constricting effect on me than in other people. Avoiding high amounts of caffeine and eating healthy foods and engaging in light aerobic exercise such as jogging or riding a bicycle seem to combat this and combat my anxiety effectively. I always feel my best after some light exercise and notice that the veins on my hands and arms appear much larger and my anxiety and depression seemingly non-existent in these times after some exercise.\n\nThough I never had any obvious intellectual disabilities, growing up I always struggled in social situations. I struggled to maintain eye contact and small talk was a bit difficult and annoying. I was always overly shy in elementary school. In high school I excelled at several subjects (anything to do with computers or technology), even more so than my teachers. I was also musically talented, but if there was one subject I was terrible at, it was math. I failed math multiple times throughout high school and ended up graduating a year late. Though I don't think this was because of any learning disability, but a lack of motivation and having low self-esteem. I also completely failed my first two years of college, but this was because I had not gone into something that interested me. I finally ended up going to college for Information Technology (IT), and today I am working successfully as a Web Developer and can code expertly in multiple programming languages. My anxiety and depression are finally under control without the need of SSRIs and I am finally more comfortable in social settings. \n\nI include this because Neurodevelopmental delay is very commonly overlooked in Marfan Syndrome, in one study of 30 children with Marfan Syndrome, 50% had some sort of minor Neurologic Deficit such as learning disability, attention deficit disorder or neuromaturational immaturity. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3232699/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3232699/) \n\nI have seem to have finally outgrown most of my neuromaturational immaturity, though I still sometimes say the wrong thing at the wrong time, and my sense of humor can get me in trouble. In college I won a student council award that said \"Oops did I say that out loud\", and although I had often had top grades in most of my classes, looking back, I see how socially immature I was at times and how I've continued to mature, even now that I enter my 30s.\n\nI always wore glasses a child, and then moved to contact lenses when I was about 12. In my late teens, my vision was barely good enough with contact lenses to drive a car.\n\nBut then suddenly, something interesting happened to my right eye. One day while working at a summer camp when I was 20 years old, my vision in my right eye became blurry. I noticed when I tilted my head, I could get a bit of the vision back for a short time, but then it stayed blurry. So I went to the nearest optometrist and told her that I had dislocated lenses in my eyes due to likely Marfan Syndrome. She looked into my eye and exclaimed \"I do not see your lens.\" There was no lens. My eyes natural lens had completely dislocated and fallen into the bottom of my eye. She immediately rushed me to the ophthalmologist, who was absolutely amazed. He looked at my eye, there was no inflammation and my retina and corneas were perfect. I then directly went back to the optometrist, and she happened to have some sample contact lenses, which was very unusual because she had one in such a high power that I needed. She had me put a plain +15 contact lens in my right eye and had me read the charts. \"Have you ever been able to read 20/20 before for distance?\" She asked. I told her no I had not. \"Well guess what, you just read 20/20. I was shocked, as my vision with contact lenses previously was barely good enough for me to hold a drivers' license.\n\nI walked out of the doctors office and I looked around and looked at the sky. I started to cry. I could see birds flying high up in the sky, I had never been able to see things at such a distance before. I will remember this day for the rest of my life.\n\nI eventually had eye surgery (Lensectomy + Vitrectomy) a few months later to remove the lens that was sitting in the bottom of my eye. It worked so well that I asked the doctor to please also schedule a second surgery, to remove the dislocated lens in my other eye. I have been aphakic (without lens) ever since. My first time glow-bowling after this was quite the experience... Why was everything so bright? It was brighter than the noon day sun in there. Peoples faces glowed. My hands seemed to be a different color, and the lights which used to be dark purple were now a blindingly bright violet light. Even some flowers seemed to have different colors. I would later find out that this was because your eyes natural lens effectively filters out UV light, and since I did not have my eyes natural lens, I could see UV light. To this day this has not seemed to have damaged my eyes at all, although I must take extra care in wearing sunglasses on bright days.\n\nBut I had one problem with my vision. Since my contact lenses were plain, and though I had perfect distance vision, I had now had *horrible* near vision. I was told that for this, I had to wear reading glasses. But I *knew* there had to be another option. I hated glasses and still do. They gave me headaches. I researched every brand of contact lens available and I found one online myself called *Proclear Multifocal XR*. But, my eye doctor had never heard the word *Multifocal* before, let alone *Multifocal XR contact lenses*.\n\nI knew my base contact lens prescription, and knew what power of reading glasses I needed, so I ordered Proclear Multifocal XR online myself and guessed for the add power. Almost miraculously, the exact prescription I ordered was what I needed and would later be prescribed. I wear Proclear Multifocal XR with a power of +15 and an add power of +2.5N in both eyes. (Generally you should wear a D in one eye and an N in the other eye, but my optometrist ordered dozens of samples and for some reason the D never would work).\n\nI found it absolutely amazing that even though I had previously worn completely different prescription contact lenses in each eye, after having the lenses removed from both my eyes, my prescription for both eyes is about the same.\n\nI've met Opthamologists over the years who are absolutely amazed. They've told me that they would never recommend implanting lenses in my eyes at this stage because they could not guarantee I would have the same vision that I have now with my contact lenses. The only downfall is that I cannot wear prescription glasses because the prescription is simply too magnifying, and if I for some reason can't wear my contact lenses, I barely would have enough vision to walk around and not walk into things. To this day I have never had any issues that have prevented me from wearing contact lenses, and I wear them 16 hours a day, and my eye doctor recently remarked \"your corneas are immaculate\".\n\nIn 2011, my Aortic root was 38mm, not high enough to have a Z score of &gt;2 (for a Marfan Diagnosis), but in 2016 that changed, when my Aortic root was 43mm. Though my cardiologist never informed me of this and I didn't know until last week.\n\nI became fed up with the system in Canada, I was told that I had to wait 1-2 *years* for my next echo, and it was already over a year since my last one. This was giving me major anxiety. I felt like my doctors had abandoned on following up with me.\n\nAfter my diagnosis of Sleep Apnea, I finally convinced my family physician to refer me to an ENT. I went to the ENT and told him \"I think I have Nasal Valve Collapse due to Marfan Syndrome, is there anything we can do\". The short answer he gave was *not really.* But I began looking online, I thought maybe if I fix my nose breathing it would improve my sleep apnea, and I found a solution! LATERA nasal valve implants. But the only problem? *They do not exist in Canada*. My ENT said he has a waiting list for people who want them to fix nasal valve collapse, and he was trained on LATERA implants but the company had actually *gave up* on getting Health Canada to approve them. What were my options? The ENT said I could have a major surgery on my nose that moved cartilage around and would make my nose wider, now obviously I didn't want this. He said that LATERA implants wouldn't cost more than 3500 USD in the USA.\n\nSo, in the middle of a pandemic, the next week, I flew to Minnesota and had the procedure done.    \nWhat I didn't know, was that I also had a deviated septum, but she had only scheduled me for the LATERA implants, so I could not be put to sleep (which is normal for most Septoplasty procedures to fix deviated septums), so she performed the Septoplasty, reduction of inferior turbinates in my nose, and the LATERA implants all at once with me awake the whole time. The process gave me some anxiety but I handled it no problem. The most nerve-wracking part is when she injected my nose with Lidocaine numbing solution that was mixed with Epinephrine (which is a vasoconstrictor), she used such a small amount of Epinephrine because my heart was racing so fast, in fact one of the smallest amounts of Epinephrine she had ever used while doing the surgery - and to her surprise, my nose barely bled at all during the procedure. \"You are not a bleeder\" she said.\n\nSo while I was in Minneapolis to get my nose breathing fixed, I thought, well why don't I see a doctor who is knowledgeable on Marfan Syndrome? I felt like my doctors in Canada were basically ignoring me. I scheduled an appointment at one of the top clinics in the country. Mayo Clinic. All within the matter of 2-3 days I had COVID-19 testing and antibody testing, full blood lab, echo-cardiogram, ECG and X-ray, and met with a Cardiologist and Geneticist. They were able to find my records from 2016 as well from the cardiologist in Canada. But all of these tests and appointments came at a high price tag, of about $5000 - which was all of my savings, and then some.\n\n*Finally*, a confirmed diagnosis. My Aortic Root was 43-44mm, (which it was 43mm in 2016 but I was never told this), so this alone with the feature of being tall and having had dislocated lenses satisfies one of the ways that Marfan Syndrome is officially clinically diagnosed.\n\nI now have a plan with my doctors moving forward. I feel like I am now taking control of my life. My anxiety and stress have been reduced substantially. I am going to be followed up with a geneticist and cardiologist in Canada. I expect to ask them about going on Losartan, or low dose of Beta Blockers with Losartan. I have a ENT doctor for any follow up on breathing issues, and a Sleep Apnea Doctor who will help me if my Sleep Apnea has not improved (though I suspect it will improve, because I already feel that I am sleeping better).\n\nI should get my genetic results back in a few weeks, and if they find something, my brother, mother and father will be tested for the same genes and have echos to check on their hearts.\n\nI finally have a more clear idea of what exercise I should be doing, how I can get involved with the Marfan community, how I will be able to ensure that I get my yearly echos, and ensure on-going follow ups from doctors from various specialties who are knowledgeable about Marfan Syndrome. \n\nMy 5 pieces of non-medical advice for patients with Marfan Syndrome are:\n\n1. Find your **doctors**. Insist your family doctor refers you to appropriate ones. You probably do not have to travel to the USA like I did in order to find a good doctor, you just have to find ones that know Marfan Syndrome and have Marfan patients. You need to have a cardiologist and geneticist and family doctor at minimum, with regular follow ups.\n2. Be aware of ***all*** of the signs and symptoms of Marfan Syndrome. The Ghent criteria does *not* contain a full list. See  [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14779072.2019.1704625](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14779072.2019.1704625) for additional proven features.\n3. Keep a history of your records, especially reports of Aortic Root dilation from echos. This will come in handy if you ever have to see a different doctor.\n4. **Don't worry.** Most patients today with Marfan Syndrome are living longer and healthier lives and there are more and more treatments for various things that can come from having Marfan Syndrome.\n5. Try and educate yourself as much as possible about Marfan Syndrome and why it happens. Be eager to learn about it. Research the new advances in medicine and new studies into Marfan Syndrome in humans and mice - but always consult your doctor before  starting a new treatment, medication or supplement.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1176, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I finally meet the clinical diagnosis for Marfan Syndrome - even though I've known I've had it all my life.

I used to play basketball and that's what I was known for.\n\nWhich coincidentally is how I learned about marfans. During a routine physical, my doctor took notice of my long limbs and digits and did a cursory exploration for marfans. My hands were flexible enough to pass the criteria, I have pretty bad myopia and flat feet. However, eye problems and a skinny childhood isn't unusual in my family and due to the fact I didnt have any dislocated lenses, my spine was straight and my skin wasn't stretchy, she decided I didn't need further testing.\n\nHowever lately, I've become quite concerned about it.

I usually hike or walk 3 miles a day for thr exercise, I try to eat healthy, I stay away from excessively unhealthy food and drugs; its killing me to think I've tried to do everything right to take care of my body and I still might have a heart condition out of my control.\n\nI've taken some solace in the fact the majority of enlarged aortas occur before the age of 19 in marfan patients because (due to a period of health anxiety, I thought I was having a heart attack and got evaluated at the hospital)  I got a chest x ray when I was 19 it came back normal, aside from having \"long lungs.\" I don't even know if I should take comfort in that but it's all I got.\n\nI once had low blood pressure during a routine checkup but every measurement since has been fine.\n\nIt's just so overwhelming to think that a week ago, I was completely content with where my health was and now I could be a week away from learning I have a heart condition that will change my life forever. I might be a week from learning I need to wait for this pandemic to subside so I can have open heart surgery.\n\nI'm a landscape photographer and travel writer, I might be a week away from learning my heart won't allow me to be in my current field of work anymore. I might be a week away from learning I shouldn't pursue grad school for anthropology due to health reasons.\n\nI'm not sure what I'm hoping to accomplish with all of this rambling. Its just so overwhelming and I think I'm just hoping the world isnt going to end", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1172, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A little reassurance", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/hvfxhu/a_little_reassurance/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "4311_4311", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3xbvfuua", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595070913, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/hteyv7/instead_of_the_negatives_of_marfans_what_are_some/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hteyv7", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/hteyv7/instead_of_the_negatives_of_marfans_what_are_some/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "moderator", "retrieved_on": 1595070924, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1166, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Instead of the negatives of Marfans, What are some of the positives?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/hteyv7/instead_of_the_negatives_of_marfans_what_are_some/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "EvilSchwin", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_43lrm", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595008370, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/ht0dal/chat_room_now_available/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ht0dal", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/ht0dal/chat_room_now_available/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1595008382, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello, /r/marfans \\-  I suddenly realized there were chat rooms available to us, so I decided to make one.

Skeletal signs and joint hypermobility have been referred to as \"soft signs\" that do not carry as much weight. \n\nMy question is, aren't both those findings age dependent? And therefore, isn't it risky to rule out Marfan's from an adult marfanoid patient without family history based on their absence? What if these patients develop those signs later on and are oblivious about it because they think they've been \"cleared\" from having the disorder and do not have regular monitoring?\n\nI'm curious about your opinions on this. \n\n(Background about me: I'm a 24 yo female, I was evaluated for Marfan's due to arachnodactyly, thin build, flat feet, joint hypermobility, mildly hyperelastic skin, sinus tachycardia and striae.

I know this is a personal topic so I don't expect anyone to post anything publicly (unless you want to), but if anyone is interested in chatting please feel free to hit me up.\n\nBack story about me:  I'm a 35 year old male and I've been with my girlfriend for 4+ years.  Our sex life has always been a rocky road due to the fact that before her I had no sexual experience and she had a much more lengthy history. She has been very patient with me but naturally there have been frustrations due to our different levels of experience. The more often these frustrations come up the less I believe them to be related to my lack of experience and more due to the fact that I am physically limited because of my Marfans.  I also feel as though it is a combination of both. I certainly know that with any physical activity I am limited, but I'm trying to gauge the extent to which I should expect to be limited.  I realize that Marfans affects people to varying degrees as far as their quality of life goes and it's difficult to compare my situation to others.  Recently I began wondering if the beta blocker I take could be adversely affecting me in this department and if switching to an alternative medicine would benefit me.  \n\nIn conclusion any advice, resources or personal experience sharing would be greatly appreciated.  Again, not expecting anyone to share publicly.  My mind is a bit all over the place with this concern right now, but I had to start somewhere.

What is the front line test which screens for Marfan's heart problems -- an echocardiogram? Can he just walk into his GP's office and ask for an echocardiogram, or will they need \"signs\" that something's wrong before they give him one? Would a simple EKG show it if something was wrong?\n\nAnd -- I guess my biggest question is -- should he/do you think he will have to first get tested for Marfans before he can get screened for the heart stuff? I know getting the Marfans diagnosis can be complicated and lots of docs don't know what they're talking about. I worry that pursuing that diagnosis will just be exhausting and for this reason it seems easier to just skip to checking out the heart to see if anything's wrong there.

proceed from where I'm now and thought I might find it here :)\n\nI had a second follow up appointment with a rheumatologist earlier today, who thinks I have Marfan.\n \nThe first time I saw him 3 weeks ago was because of some tendon injuries in different parts of my body, which have been caused by repetitive movements and have been going on for a couple of months now with only minor improvement and many setbacks.\n\nAfter examining me on the first visit, he ordered me to get a few tests done including a CT of the torso and some blood test (FBN1 and lupus, arthritis, etc.).\n\nHowever, I didn't do the genetic test as it would have  cost me 2000 AUD and I wanted to see the results of the CT scan first, because I had read that without eye issues or aneurysm Marfan can be ruled out anyway.\n\nSo, today we discussed the test results and he said that I have many features of the disease, but he can't diagnose me with Marfan because I'm not having any aneurysms (CT scan confirmed it) or eye problems.\n\nHowever, he also said that even though my eyes and aorta don't show any damage, I'm still what they call a \"marfanoid type\", because of the many body features that indicate it (e.g. wrist sign, thumb sign just makes it, long and slender, crowded teeth, high arched palate, hindfoot deformity, hernias, arm span a bit longer than body height, ....)\n\n\n\nI still can't get peace of mind after that conversation because it neither confirms it, nor does it rule out any progression in the future.\n\nIs or was anyone in the same situation or has some advice as to what to do?\n\nShould I do the genetic testing?\n\nLooking forward to some ideas :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id":

My husband was joking that he had all the symptoms and I looked it up and realized he did have a lot. Caved in chest, tall thin build, very flexible joints, history of tendon injuries. My son, now 14, has the same build &amp; chest. Their dimensions aren't exaggerated enough to quite pass the Marfan \"tests\" they show online, but only just short of it. We brought it up with their doctors and were brushed off.\n\nFast forward to this week. My husband (age 46) starts having chest pain. Saw the doc, slightly elevated BP (140/90 I think) and elevated troponin sends him by ambulance to the hospital. Cardiac catheterization finds several scad tears in his arteries (everything else is fine, no plaque or evidence of heart disease). Cardiologist says what he saw indicates a connective tissue disorder, that it looks like Marfans, but \"not the typical case\" (likely because his dimensions are not quite over that line). It's possible he has a different connective tissue disorder, but Marfans is the best fit to my untrained eye.\n\nI read the post about no one here being able to dx, I completely understand that. What I'm wondering about is the process. We live in the Boston area and there is a Marfans clinic at the Brigham. We will seek a referral there. But I want to know how do they diagnose? What kinds of tests do they run? Do you see a cardiologist? Did you see a geneticist? Those who are Marfan dxed what kind of doctors do you see regularly for ongoing care? And how regularly?\n\nI'm also wondering about what to do for my son. My husband already having a serious heart issue I know they will take it seriously now. But I want to figure out how to get my son diagnosed if he has it and how to handle getting my son the proper care he needs to prevent issues from developing later in life.

years old and for the past couple years I've been struggling with chest pain , its varies in intensity and has gotten worse over the years \nI've got pain in the left side of my chest , in the upper part of my back and recently I have this tearing sensation in my abdomen,  I've been to the A&amp;E countless times \nWhere they do a tracing of my heart,  that is apparently slightly abnormal with high waves and is because of me being tall, they do an xray and send me home \n\nI use to work as a porter in Heathrow helping  passengers with reduce mobility getting off and on to airplanes, I really enjoyed job  until my chest pain was so bad and this thumping pain in my abdomen that I had to lie about a knee injury to my colleagues saying I couldn't come back \n\nI googled up chest pain in young people and came across marfan syndrome, I could do all the hand signs , high arched palate , stretch marks in the middle of back , scoliosis \nI went to go and see my gp who referred me to St barts hospital where I was given an echocardiogram \nI was told my aorta is within normal limits and nothings wrong with my heart\n\nI told her the pain isn't in my head and there's something your missing \nExplained my marfan syndrome concerns me  and told her to give me a genetic test\n\nI was given the genetic test and it was revealed that I had a fbn1 mutation of uncertain significance,  got a letter saying it could be pathogenic and is known to cause Aortic issues so would have to be monitored every 2 years \n\nSo my chest pain was so bad and the doctor at barts really did not seem to care at all in tackling my symptoms \nI found it hard to believe my mutation along with he chest pain was a coincidence  and was still not given a diagnosis \nI contacted the marfan organisation and was offered to see a Doctor child who is a specialist in marfan \nShe took an echocardiogram and told me she heard murmur , I  have a mitral valve  prolapse and regurgitation,  that I have bfid-p wave and my left ventricul is slightly enlarged \n\nShe said that she believes that Iberstan should help with my pain  and should refrain from doing heavy work , and that if it doesn't help I may need surgery \n\nShe wrote to Dr pandya at St barts hospital \n\nAnd I've never felt so defeated in my life in what happened \ndoctor pandya called me yelling about it not being ideal that i went to see another doctor, I asked why she never mentioned any of these things and felt as if I were attacking her reputation \nBut I just wanted help with my pain and finding a diagnosis \n\nshe held an emergency jsa meeting to dismiss Dr annes findings \nThe got a team of cardiologist basically to cover there ass for not mentioning anything to me \nCalling all the findings trivial and not related to the pain I feel \nShe wrote claiming im on universal credit \nWhich I'm not and even if I was has nothing to do with my health \n\nAnd now I'm stuck with my chest pain which is being untreated , and

Just sharing my experience for others to follow along!\n\nI have suspected Marfan for awhile now. But since it is such a rare disease, and I already have a lot of other conditions (I get poked fun at and called a \"hypochondriac\" even though I'm formally diagnosed), I decided not to pursue seeing specialists. It is SO HARD to get doctors to listen to you, take you seriously, and put in the legwork to get you formally diagnosed. I thought, maybe I'd better just let this one go...too much hassle and it likely won't amount to any closure. \n\nBUT THEN! My dad casually told me that my cousin was diagnosed with a rare disease, but that he forgot the name of it. I said, oh, what are the symptoms? I went cold as he described what I knew to be Marfan. When I asked if it was that, he said yep that's it! My parents - and nobody in my family - knows I have any illness whatsoever or that I suspect Marfan. I don't tell relatives about my health. \n\nNow that my cousin has it - confirmed - I decided to look into it, too. I have an appointment scheduled with a new primary care on 11/19. She is a nurse, I feel that nurses listen better than MDs. Wish me luck. I hope I can get to the bottom of this. \n\nI am 27, female, was born \"long and lanky\" and have continued to be long and lanky my whole life, never gained weight (I stopped growing at age 13 and still wear those same clothes to this day), have odd flexibilities (like being able to bend my thumb across my palm), flat feet, tall, out of proportion, some curvature to my spine although not extreme, weak joints, almost all of my baby teeth had to be extracted instead of losing them naturally and my teeth are super tight, my heart \"doesn't behave\" (I get a lot of uncomfortable heart symptoms but they are hard to catalogue). I do not have vision problems and my sternum is not visibly disformed that I can tell. \n\nWish me luck everyone, I hope I can get to the bottom of what is all going on with me!

He is still in the hospital and feeling miserable. He is continuing to have cold sweats but his levels are looking good. He is occasionally coughing up blood as well.

I have severe scoliosis (S-curve, both 45\u00b0), I am tall (193cm, 18M, 76kg), my arms and legs are long and my wrists and ankles are thin. My hands and feet are also big. I also have some ligament problems with one of my clavicles, but that's the only place where I have a connective tissue problem (maybe caused by imbalances from scoliosis?). I can wrap my fingers around my wrist but I cannot do the thumb test. I have not measured my wingspan to height ratio but from what I can tell by eyeballing is that it's pretty close to 1:1. \n\nOther than that, I don't think I have any other noticable symptoms. No one in my close family has been diagnosed with either Marfan or scoliosis, however, my siblings are also tall with quite long and thin limbs (mine are the longest and the thinnest in relation to height in my family). On the systemic score scale I would estimate 3-4 points, but don't know for sure.\n\nI don't think I'm particularly hypermobile anywhere (as the thumb test failed). What makes me worried in particular is how I'm built. As mentioned, most of my physique fits in with the typical marfan in terms of limbs etc. I looked at professional basketball players and noticed a fair bit of them have thin wrists with very big hands and long arms and they don't have Marfans, which gave me a little hope.\n\nI am very worried that I might have Marfans, and I don't know if I could mentally handle being diagnosed with it, along with my severe scoliosis. Is it possible that my physique just happens to resemble Marfans and my scoliosis and stuff is unrelated?

Like, uh, the fat guy that does mukbang videos (whose name i forgot.) It pays them for actions that could kill them. I very much prefer to ignore them. \n\nBut this woman (i have no other descriptor of her)... i googled her weight out of intrigue. She is either overrating herself massively or is roughly the same weight I was (40kgs at 175cm) around 2015 to late 2018, back when I had the utter hell that was my back-rods sucking the fuck out of me (im now 48kg after their removal, which is still scrawny as hell.) Its not something im proud of - it left me sedantary and unable to move for hours on end without bed-support.\n\nIts... uncanny, looking at this. I dont know who this woman is, or she has mental issues leading to the state she's in. But Ive never felt a fraction of physical insecurity - ones that would warrant regulation of food-intake, other insecurities aplenty - my entire life (besides the pressure to *gain* weight). I dont have aneroxia or bulimia. I dislike most foods, their taste, and the process of eating them..... but damn. Its weird seeing a reflection of myself in her.\n\nAnd its even more frightening to read a vitriol shes getting. Did people think i was crazy, back then? Did they fetishize me? Did they wish to be me? Did they see i was sick and reckoned it was my fault (ie my own personality disorder) desire to be stark-thin? Did they hold me in contempt or pity or fetishization?its just weird looking at people discuss her so thoroughly and thinking - \"I *was* her.'' It feels like theyre analyzing a reflection of me. Ive just been made familiar with just how *different\u2022 I looked back then and now im just thinking about how that affected my social life. \n\nAnyone else?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1574, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[Vent]Eugenia clooney", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/pj6j4x/venteugenia_clooney/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "__yggdrasil__", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_xaj01", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1630874718, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/pikzk2/lens_replacement_surgery/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pikzk2", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/pikzk2/lens_replacement_surgery/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1630874729, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello, I am about to have eye surgery due to my lens dislocating and is causing reduced vision.

Anyhow; we meassured my wingspan (it was 3' longer than i was tall i believe), and he also concluded i was hyperflexiable (But so is my dad and both grandparents on that side). I got a time to check eyes and my heart. Nothing wrong with my lenses or eyes in general and also was told i had one of the better hearts she'd seen. I had no weird spine, nothing wrong with my ribcage and only very slightly flatfooted. At this point my doctor was almost certain there was nothing wrong with me but to be sure he ordered a genetics test and that also showed nothing, so he concluded there was no way i had marfans since the only requirement i fulfilled was longer arms, hyperflexiablity and flatfootedness. I quickly forgot about it, but a couple of weeks ago someone commented on my wingspan when we compared and it got me worried again, should I be worried?

I take Whey protein and take supplements (fish oil, calcium, Vitamin C to be exact)\n\nCan someone recommend me an effective workout for weights, or even an alternate form of exercise? And if anyone knows the effects of Marfan's on protein synthesis/muscle building that would be great.

Sorry for the late notice, but I have a first appointment with a thoracic surgeon tomorrow afternoon. I'd love to get suggestions, especially from people who are post-op, for questions I should be asking. Any help would be appreciated. \n\nFor background, I've know I have marfans for... over 20 years now. This past summer, a CT came up with an aortic measurement of 4.5cm :( My cardiologist said if it'd been any larger, he would have pulled the trigger already. \n\nThis visit was facilitated by my cardiologist, so that I am a face and a person to the surgeon, not just some random name with a chest to crack when it comes time. The surgeon had me go for an echo and CT last week, to get an update before the appointment. \n\nSo, yeah... wish me luck on the recent tests - not sure I'm ready yet for this surgery :/ And I could really use advice on anything important I should ask.\n\nThanks in advance, everyone!!\n\n**UPDATE:** Well, done with the appointment. The surgeon has lots of experience with Marfans patients, thank goodness (even though his cute nurse had never heard of it), and he was actually very positive about things. I learned (referencing one of the comments) that it is indeed considered an aneurysm at this point, not a dilation. I learned that he's not putting a lot of restrictions on me, as long as there's not an abrupt rise in blood pressure (which probably means I shouldn't look at his cute nurse too long XD). I learned the procedure he's looking at is an aneurysmectomy. \n\nAnd I learned that he has a very positive outlook on things, so I'm good until I need to do another CT and follow-up next year (no cute nurse for a year?? maybe better that way XD)\n\nVery relieved!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Advice for thoracic surgeon appointment?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/67egtc/advice_for_thoracic_surgeon_appointment/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1492969099, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/673j06/i_played_a_amateurish_squash_game_what_do_you/", "gilded": 0, "id": "673j06", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/673j06/i_played_a_amateurish_squash_game_what_do_you/", "retrieved_on": 1494626512, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "default", "title": "I played a amateurish squash game.

I'm 19 years old, 6' (183cm), 150 lbs (68kgs) with a 6'5.5 arm span, and my inseam is about half my height. My hands are 20cm and my feet are 27cm long.

I was a relatively short child until I was about 14 where I shot up pretty quickly and I had some growing pains in my knees back then but that's all gone.\n\nI can wrap my pinky and thumb around my wrist easily and do the steinberg sign but I don't have any super flexible finger or wrist joints. My elbows extends slightly beyond 180 degrees however (I believe a marfans symptom is your elbow not fully extendning however). I haven't had any scoliosis (although I have a slight rounding in my upper back), my chest isn't indented and doesn't protrude and my vision is really good (although everyone else in my family has glasses). I had flat feet as a kid but orthotics fixed that and I haven't had it since. I also had an overbite and crowded teeth as a kid but I got braces and they're fine now. I had an ECG and chest x ray done because I was feeling a bit short of breath, but both came back fine and my resting bpm was 79. My oxygen saturation was also 98% and my BP is fine. I haven't had any palpitations and played a fair bit of sport back in high school.\n\nMy parents aren't super tall, Mom is about 5'8 and Dad is about 5'10, but my sister is tall and skinny for her age as well. My dad's dad is tall (probably over 6 foot) and he's lived till old age despite a lot of drinking and my mom's parents are both above average height but that's it.

He declined and it hadn\u2019t affected him until now. \n\nBetween the inward bowing and a LOT of scar tissue they were unable to do the replacement that day.

Myself, my mom, my mom's twin sister, my brother, and a couple of my cousins have it as well. We are pretty sure it was passed down by my mother's biological father who is not in the picture. I have had the lens implants, scoliosis metal rods, a tarlov cyst, an IVC filter, 2 aortic dissections repaired the second with valve replacement, and both of my boys were c sections to avoid labor stress.  My symptoms thus far have been the back, heart, and eyes. I am tall and skinny, would've been over 6 ft easily if they hadn't put the rods in at 13. My 18 year old son that has marfans has very slight aortic dialation, has had lens implants, and his retina detached in one eye but other than that nothing this far. He has been 6 ft 4 inches since he was 16. This is just what I can think of at this moment. If anyone has any questions for me I'd be happy to answer.

The idea of having any illness affecting the heart terrifies me.\n\nI recently went to A&amp;e for an attack of sorts, one of many I've had for 6 years. To my surprise, the consultant did all sorts of unorthodox checks like my arm length, body type, previous tests and so on. At first I was relieved because all other doctors simply wrote me off with anxiety. Others diagnosed things like LPR Reflux and Asthma, but we never found anything to control my symptoms. \n\nAs soon as I heard the words Marfan Syndrome, I had to look it up for my own sanity. Turns out it did more harm than good. I'm 27 years old, and one if the first things I read was how people left untreated don't make it past 35.\n\nI did my best to have a CT Scan but I was so symptomatic and anxious the test didn't have concrete results. A Chest XRay showed nothing, however 5 years ago I had Echocardiagram proving mild Mitral Valve Prolapse.\n\nSome of my symptoms match Marfan's. I'm extremely tall, unusually skinny with long arms, crowded teeth and have poor eyes, trouble sleeping and a weird ribcage suggesting scoliosis. Other things do not match. I have nornal sized legs, no deformity in chest shape otherwise, poor flexibility, normal sized fingers and toes and from what we've seen so far, no damage internally. I also have Raynauds which is not associated with Marfan's but strikes with my symptoms.\n\nI'll be honest. At this stage I pray for a miracle. Anxiety is plastered all over my records for years, so even if I prove I have Marfan's, it will be near impossible for me to get surgery for it. My only hope is that my consultant was wrong and that, despite so many matching symptoms, I don't have Marfan's at all.\n\nFor the sake of helping me hold onto what little hope I have left, please let me know if anyone here has had many symptoms of the disease, but did not end up having the Syndrome.

A couple months ago I accompanied my grandmother (who also has MVP) to the hospital for circulatory abnormalities in her arms and legs, and after the doctors saw how hypermobile she and I both are they recommended we get checked out by cardiologists for connective tissue disorders. I also kept being told by my professor to see a cardiologist, because I'm in training to be a healthcare technician and whenever my classmates do EKGs on me they always come out saying \"1st degree AV block, rightward axis, borderline EKG.\"   \n\n\nMy family thinks that there's probably nothing wrong beyond the MVP, because my grandmother was a world-class gymnast as a teen and young adult, and has lived into her 70s without serious heart problems. Plus, my mom has no symptoms of anything unusual except the hypermobility (which literally everyone in my family has). My aunt and cousins are all very tall and thin, and 3/4 of them have the bad circulation too, and one of them has the sunken sternum, but since my cousins' dad was also very tall and thin that might just be how they're built? I guess I should add that I can do the thumb sign easily, it's harder to tell if I can do the wrist sign because I have cubital tunnel and a right wrist brace, but I'm pretty sure I can do it, but *barely.* Like they don't overlap, they just touch. (Nearsightedness and tooth crowding do also run in my family, but it's not like those are rare.)  \n\n\nI'm simultaneously nervous and excited to be screened. I've been dealing with feeling like my body is 85 years old since I was ten, with migraines, fibromyalgia, and bad circulation causing all kinds of cold and dizziness. If they can figure out a defined diagnosis that there's treatments for, and it helps me feel better, that'd be SO amazing. But also, I don't want my family to be affected by a disease that will limit their lives at all going forward, one of my cousins is only 7 and she loves sports :(   \n\n\nI guess I'm asking how I should prepare? Both for the appointment when it happens, and also for receiving the news, whether I have it or not. What was being screened for Marfan like for you, and learning that you had it? Other than an echocardiogram and EKG, what tests will they do? How long will it take? And since the wait time is so long, does a positive result seem likely enough that I should be encouraging my cousins to get appointments now, instead of waiting for my results, and then they could just cancel if I'm negative?

However I'm at an age now where osteoarthritis has set into all my joints and I can no longer pass the Beighton test except for my knees (which are severely unstable, along with my SI joints) and pinky fingers. I was 6 out of 9 on Beighton \\~20 years ago when diagnosed as \"hypermobile,\" now in middle age I'm a 3. I do however still have the Walker-Murdoch wrist sign and Steinberg thumb sign for Marfan, as well as easily doing the \"reverse namaste,\" so the rheumatologist I saw for hEDS diagnosis is thinking I actually have a form of Marfan. I am relatively tall for a woman (a little over 5'9\"), thin with fairly long fingers and toes (though  definitely not as long as some of y'all, people comment on them), and although I look like I have long arms enough for people comment on it, they don't quit reach the wingspan ratio required for a Marfan diagnosis. I have an extremely long torso for some reason, which runs in my family and makes it impossible to wear pants or one-piece swimsuits, but I have never seen that listed as a Marfan symptom. I have myopia (near-sighted). I had severe scoliosis as a child, which is now less severe thanks to a chiropractor and traction chair. I still have cervical kyphosis. I have many tall, thin family members with long fingers - that seems to come from my mother's side of the family.\n\nBecause of the mitral valve prolapse and my wingspan ratio not quite being right for Marfan, he thinks I have a related collagen disorder called \"MASS phenotype\" (which stands for Mitral valve, Myopia, Aorta, Skin and Skeletal features, according to google). The thing is, I am IN SO MUCH EXCRUCIATING PAIN. All. The. Time. I can't concentrate, I can't walk without a severe limp, I can only take baby steps to avoid the tearing sensation in my hip joints that comes from taking a normal stride. I can't sleep because of the pain in all of my joints, I can't sit for too long because of my unstable SI joints. And I partially dislocate my joints just from lightly stretching, and sometimes in my sleep. I also have dysautonomia (POTS) and I've only seen that associated with Ehlers-Danlos. My initial research into Marfan and MASS isn't saying anything about severe pain as a symptom, and I've been having these painful partial dislocations in all my joints since I was 11 years old. Is this something people with Marfan experience that just isn't widely known? Does anyone else have MASS form of Marfan? It doesn't sound like something that should cause such severe pain I guess?

Loneliness is a depressing combination with Marfans.\n\nBeen suffering from Marfans since I was young and never really let it get in the way. It started to get in the way during high school, but I focused mostly on relationships of which I had two, one with a really nice girl 'S' and spent 2 1/2 years or 3, not really sure anymore, together and I loved her to death. We got along so gosh darn well, it's ridiculous. I always went over to her house, even though it wasn't exactly \"clean\" but that'd be her parents fault, not so much hers. I spent every day of my life talking to her, and discussing so much together. I'll never have that back and it really hurts. Around the end of the relationship a LOT was going on. Her father ended up breaking us up because we were messing around in a public park because her father was being overbearing even though we'd been dating for over 2 years, and apparently her fathers friend saw us, and told him, and told her to come home. Kicked me out, and forced her to break up with me and move on. She ended up dating the one guy that I had always been cautious about her being friends with cause he clearly had feelings for her. Few of those kinda guys.. Annoying. Anyways she ended up \"moving on\" but hoping we'd get back together, so did I, but she wasn't really.. trying to fix it?\n\nSkipping a bunch of teen drama..\n\nI started dating a new girl who I got along with and joked around with a lot in my math class, I'll call her \"K\". We'd sit on the floor in class, and the teacher was really cool about it, honestly he helped push our relationship into an actual relationship.. Love ya forever even though I cannot remember his name.. We started spending a lot of time together at my place, walking around the city together, and just being a solid couple. I wasn't exactly the best boyfriend especially with my emotional situation, I really missed S, she was a good person, and just wanted the best for herself and me. Me and K seemed to get along much better than S as K was more.. Mature and responsible, though she herself wasn't exactly the best at cleaning her room, which kept me away from her house - so we spent most of our time at my house.\n\nCouple situations that really negatively effected S opinion of me, like \"flaunting\" the relationship in front of her, because she hurt me and I guess my teenbrain decided that was a good idea.\n\nAnyways, I started being a bit of an asshole near the end of the relationship because of depression and emotional issues, Not treating K right, putting sex above the relationship even though I'd tell myself how much she means to me, and she really did, Sex just really helped get my mind out of the gutter.\n\nEnded up breaking up with me over my behavior and the way I was treating her, totally understand and respect her decision. Now she's moved on and happy, and I'm glad for her.\n\nAt the end of the day though, I miss them both, and the loneliness is killing me for years, I've been alone for at least 4-5 years, probably longer, and never really known what to do. Dating in our modern society is so hard, especially when dealing with physical pain on a daily basis.\n\nI've tried to kill myself a lot in the past, but I want to live, and I want to be happy, and I've always tried to be as happy as I can with what I have, because it could always be worse.\n\nI ended up getting back to talking to S like a year ago, she broke up with a guy, and I had been talking to her for quite some time, being there for her and talking to her about life issues, I really wanted to get back together and work it out.\n\nI ended up paying her around 4,200 total for supporting her in various ways, in return, we spent a lot of time together and always talked when she could and I loved spending time with her so gosh damn much just being around her made me so happy, we had sex a few times, I haven't been happy in years, until I was around her. Nothing made me happier than giving her a big fucking hug.\n\nBut she had changed. She's a drug user now, she makes bad decisions, and in the end didn't truly want to be with me or care about me, and yet again my heart was broken for a third time. A lot of lies and backstabbing towards me when I never deserved it. I was there for her always.\n\nAll I can think is how much her father ruined her own daughters life simply because we chose to do sexual things and how lonely I am because of him. I've contemplated so much negative things and obviously never acted on them because at the end of the day I don't know what to do when it comes to anything, raised by a single mother with issues of her own, never taught how to treat a woman until I learned myself how to be responsible and mature.\n\nI live on my own now with a roommate, but daily I want to hang myself from the neck until dead. Though I know I'll never do it. I'm just lonely to the point where it causes me panic attacks. Please don't recommend a therapist or anything, I've talked to everyone in my life about this, and there's not much anyone can do, or say, to change these feelings, they're just how I feel and our society is so hard to live in.\n\nI've always wanted to be in a relationship, and always wanted to start a family, and have that life. I see so many people with that ruining their opportunity and it hurts so much.\n\nNowadays I'm just happy with what I have, but I have no clue how to further myself in life, how to meet someone like myself. I've gotten a call center job which isn't that great and finding a job itself has been the worse and most depressing experience ever.\n\nOur society is not built for people like me.\n\nI haven't been taking my medication properly for my mechanical aorta valve stuff until recently simply because I haven't cared and been heartbroken.\n\nI've even tried to commit death by cop and lost an airsoft pistol that I highly valued due to confiscation, and from someone who only makes $1169/mo it's frustrating.\n\nI have 12 reptiles, and a collection of airsoft guns, I love animals and gun-building, but I cannot even afford it.\n\nI spend most of my time programming a bunch of Paradox Interactive Games modifications, basically just historical games. Europa Universalis IV, Hearts of Iron IV. They're somewhat popular. It's kinda sad because for a 20 year old, they're all I have to show for my life. They are not something to be proud of as I gain nothing from them.\n\nI have some kinda learning disability, I TRIED to upgrade my math to go to collage or something, but I could not do the math properly. I've never been good at math, numbers, and any major thing like that. I got by our poor education system by playing games and getting C's and doing non-education courses like cooking.\n\nBeen trying to find a relationship lately, but it's not going well, and I don't know HOW to meet people aside from Facebook dating, and I haven't even met anyone yet.\n\nSpent 5 years of my life in relationships, and 5 years single. I hate not having someone in my life who cares like during the relationships.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore.\n\nA LOT of this story is missing, but I've smoked so much weed in the past to numb the physical and emotional pain, that I just cannot even recall anymore. I quit smoking recently and the emotions are really coming out.\n\nThanks for reading.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 985, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My life with Marfans", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/f4og95/my_life_with_marfans/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Bekah679872", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_xfwk6ki", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1581800112, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/f4fk4k/anyone_here_have_success_with_contacts/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f4fk4k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/f4fk4k/anyone_here_have_success_with_contacts/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1581800115, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve been told since I was younger that I can\u2019t have contacts because my astigmatism is too bad for a contact lens to stay in place.

During this time, I took no cardiac medications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Purpose of this thread**  \nNow, here's the purpose of this thread, I wanted to ask about how your aorta changed according to your age. I can't seem to find any information online regarding this. Normal aortic growth (according to a paper on NCBI) is supposed to be 0.1 per decade of life after the 20's,  which is basically when you stop growing.  \n\n\nI'm very interested in knowing, especially those of you who developed aortic dilation later in life as opposed to in your teen years. I'm really interested in going to the gym to improve my self image.

I'll start off by just listing off the symptoms that lead me to believe this:\n\n* Positive wrist/thumb sign, although my hands are definitely much wider than the marfan hands i've seen\n* very slender figure, difficulty putting on weight\n* slight chest indentation\n* overly flexible joins in fingers and arms\n* extremely stretchy skin\n\nI am probably forgetting some, but you probably get the idea. I don't have any vision problems, and as far as I'm aware no heart problems - but this could just as easily be due to my very relaxed lifestyle. I had an echo cardiogram done in 2018 because of concerns about fatigue during exertion, although I feel fine now. The test showed no abnormalities.\n\nRecently my doctor referred me to a dna test because she was also concerned by my odd physique, and put me down for EDS and marfan. However, I could not go through with the test because they wanted me to meet a whole bunch of unreasonable criteria (basically, they won't test you unless your heart has already ruptured at some point or some other life threatening complication).\n\nSo, I ended up just having my DNA sequenced by 23andMe so I could see the genes associated with these illnesses. I checked my COL3A1 and COL1A1 genes for EDS, and they are both basically normal. What I did find though, are two poorly documented mutations in my FBN1 gene, which is responsible for marfan. \n\nFirst is rs397515835 which should be CT;CT, while mean it T;T.\n\nSecond is rs397515834, which is supposed to be TT;TT, while mine is T;T again. \n\nOn [this site](https://instem.res.in/cardiodatabase/gene/FBN1/clinvar) they are both listed as potential markers for marfan, but specifically when an insertion or deletion is present, hence corrupting the rest of the FBN1 gene by putting it out of sync (or at least, this is my understanding). However, in my DNA, these positions are equally replaced on both sides, so the rest of the FBN1 gene checks out normally. I am just confused as to what this means, since I seem to have an unusual variant here which is not documented anywhere.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 968, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Difficulty Diagnosing, DNA results inconclusive", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/ewny3i/difficulty_diagnosing_dna_results_inconclusive/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Zaxter877", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3vogbp4b", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1580403725, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/ew8j5h/loose_hood_with_zipperslip_on_shoes_with/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ew8j5h", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/ew8j5h/loose_hood_with_zipperslip_on_shoes_with/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "tTBt0XEys9Xzyn8Z-30EBv0FGTmA79Yo30PDMSZkg8c", "resolutions": [{"height": 216, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/q14ijk656yd41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=641a7c0d4c9debaeb175ea8815fe9fbc1f1c239e", "width": 108}, {"height": 432, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/q14ijk656yd41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8302694304c0d7c907adcef79d9f0c3a9ab1d8cf", "width": 216}, {"height": 640, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/q14ijk656yd41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c6d68b2973613686064c7b19e9c91c75710be2a", "width": 320}, {"height": 1280, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/q14ijk656yd41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9a6ba3edcbdfeb0f76b428212debcbbee53958d", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 2160, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/q14ijk656yd41.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=096a1b87397e942c79aa8e25645dfd4d00cb5d91", "width": 934}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1580403732, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 968, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xba6iadqofjMrq9__GkbwTUUglh5MKBOR8ClarOGY3c.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Loose hood with zipper,Slip on shoes with eyelets,rolled up jeans", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/q14ijk656yd41.jpg"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hoipok", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_yf6t0sj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1580369673, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/ew1rwk/contacts/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ew1rwk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/ew1rwk/contacts/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1580369675, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello, was wondering if anyone have contacts that suit their prescriptions.

I can get enough decent reads to eventually set my cell phone scanners, but they then almost never subsequently work.\n\nWhen I eyeball what is different about my prints, I assume it's because they have lots of \"cracks\" in them - I can see lots of small broken lines through my whorls.\n\nI think, if I committed a crime, a prints expert could easily identify my prints bc they don't really look like those of other people, but when computers try to compare my prints, I think all the cracks confuse the machines - the shapes mine make aren't readable by the pattern matches bc the machines are based on expected normal patterns - and mine don't comply.\n\nI've assumed this is because I'm a marf - but I actually can't find any research about it anywhere.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 952, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Fingerprints don't work?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/ephngj/fingerprints_dont_work/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "xjosephzStyxx", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4sb45a4n", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1579020477, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/eonsfc/possible_marfans_case_not_looking_for_a_diagnosis/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eonsfc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/eonsfc/possible_marfans_case_not_looking_for_a_diagnosis/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1579020479, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey guys, just wanted to make this post to get some insight into my situation.  \n\n\nSo, I'm a 22 year old male who is 6'1 and weighs 134lb. I've certain typical Marfan body traits (my ghent nosology according to the marfan foundation is 6 without taking into consideration things that cannot be seen without testing, such as potrucio acetabuli, dural ectasia, etc). However, I lack every described facial characteristics.   \n\n\nNow here's the interesting part, I had an echo done when I was 17 (august 2014) and my aortic root was at 2.9. Fast forward to last week (2020), I had another echo done, my aortic root is at 3.0cm (5.4 year gap w/o medication for possible marfan's) however, with this second echo, it is worth noting that my BSA increased by a \\~0.10 margin (from 1.66 -&gt; 1.76) this is due to increase in weight \\~126lb (2014) -&gt; \\~134lb (2020) and height \\~5'10 (2014) -&gt; \\~6'1 (2020). Everything on the echo seemed clear. I also had a CT angiography (w/ constrast) done with extra focus on the rest of my aorta: Ascending aorta 2.1cm and descending was below 2.0. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize that none of us here are doctors, but I'm just wondering about you guy's idea on the matter regarding my aorta. Physically I'm very skinny, tons of stretch marks in my back which I got as a grew taller in puberty, arachnodactyly, mild pectus carinatum, finger hypermobility, wrist sign only, and finally slouchy posture.  \n\n\nI've a second appointment with my cardiologist soon, but he stated that even if my aorta was below 3.7cm hypothetically speaking, I could engage in activities such as isometric exercises.

As many of you know, whats you do it once then you know what to expect. Pain isnt the problem.\nBut now I just feel like I have no drive. I rather sit and do nothing. Things just dont produce the same excitement and I feel I get caught up more and more thinking about how marfans is going to affect me more down the line. \nI guess im just wondering if anyone has felt the same?

I recovered from all of it pretty quickly and got back on track with exercising and swimming, but everytime I was at a peak I had some major medical thing. Also, because I missed so much school I decided to redo the year on my own terms. My school was not really a big help, but they were kind enough to copy some grades to my current year so I don't have to do everything over.\n\nThen, this fall, I had a retinal detachment on my best eye and I went through surgery for that as well. To make it even worse, it was in the middle of a test week. Again, I was behind on school and I had to make the tests over the past couple weeks. I got pretty good grades so I was pleased to be able to focus on this term instead of the last. On top of that, I got a new swimming record which I am quite proud of.\n\nThen, I went to the back specialist(? I don't know if this is the right English term) and the results were pretty fucking dissapointing. My escoliosis is now critically bad and I am now scheduled to get surgery to put it in place with metal rods. I am a emotionally stable guy but it hurt to hear it nontheless. I don't wanna have to go through all the bullshit with school again. I don't wanna have to start from scratch with swimming again. And, I don't want my back to be permanently stuck in place. But these are all just things me and probably a lot of you have to deal with. It sucks, but it's also just \"shit happens\".\n\nAnyhoo, I am not looking forward to it.

And this does not mean you should make a post asking whether you should see a doctor. You should. Specifically, see a cardiologist.\n\nIf you need help in this endeavor (it's scary and intimidating, we know) please visit the Marfan Foundation (link above).

About 2 months ago I started to seriously suspect I had Marfans (I have many of the features of it). When I started to suspect it I stopped all cardio and started only going 2-3 times a week (before I was going 3-4) but 4 weeks ago I started getting chest pains (right where my heart is, very isolated pain, brief but painful) in the gym, so I stopped going after a week, and since then I haven't been going but I've been getting the pains seemingly randomly throughout the day, sometimes they are quite severe, and about a week or 2 ago I had it where straining on the toilet was causing pain on my heart and the harder I strained the more it hurt (I have chronic constipation) and the next day it hurt almost constantly for about 4 hours. I ended up going to a doctors clinic but the receptionist sent me to an emergency room where they did ecg/bp/oxygen% but that was all normal. After that episode I've been so tired I've been sleeping up to about 80% of the time but in the last week I think I've been getting less pain and am able to be awake a bit more.\n\nYesterday I was finally able to see a doctor (due to moving recently I hadn't been able to), and he seemed to think it was definitely worth following up and has now referred me to a genetic clinic for testing. So I guess it's just a wait now until I find out.\n\nHowever... I really don't want to lose the (admittedly small) amounts of muscle I have gained over the last few months, so I really would like to go to the gym. I have read that doing large sets of small-weight reps is nearly as effective as the standard of doing smaller sets of heavier weights for building muscles, and that this may be less-unsafe with Marfans, so that's what I would be doing.

I have visited my GP before and have been assessed and they returned with \u2018you\u2019re hypermobile, but you don\u2019t have anything to worry about.\u2019 I\u2019ve had an EKG (ECG here in the UK) and all came back normal having been reviewed by three separate doctors.

I\u2019m also taller than my parents. We don\u2019t really have any history of significant heart disease in the family (grandparents / dads uncles have had triple bypass surgery at 80+ years old after being lifetime smokers, but nothing too out of the ordinary.)\n\nMy question is: is there anyone else on here who exhibited the Marfan skeletal features only to be assessed and confirmed they don\u2019t have Marfans? I.e. diagnosed with some form of EDS I.e. hEDS or Joint Hypermobility Syndrome without cardiac / ocular feature?\n\nNow I know I cannot get a diagnosis online without seeing a healthcare professional and I\u2019m not expecting / asking for one. I will be following up with my GP and potentially asking for a referral to alleviate my fears but I just want to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation where they\u2019ve exhibited skeletal features but not ended up having Marfans. \n\nThanks all x", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 890, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Marfanoid Habitus and not having Marfans?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/dz5qdd/marfanoid_habitus_and_not_having_marfans/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Dark-Lunch-Studio", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4fxbjk4h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574271248, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/dz5b55/research_to_accurately_portray_character_with/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dz5b55", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/dz5b55/research_to_accurately_portray_character_with/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574271249, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a story in my head that I'm getting ready to put onto paper or into pixels.

He spent his youth in a back brace, a sternum brace, and in and out of the hospital. He's had a few surgeries to fix  some heart complications and spine issues. The story covers his early 20s through late 30s. he lives in the US.

I've heard from a friend with ehlers-danlos that they feel daily body aches similar to the kind one gets with the flu and that its effected by barometric pressure. I know the syndromes are related, but not if this is a shared similarity. \n* What struggles do you have that someone without Marfans would not? \n* Does having Marfans affect your diet? Do you struggle with gaining weight? \n* If you're on the thin side of Marfans, are you frequently cold because lack of body fat and blood circulation issues?\n* If you get sick with a cold or anything involving a lot of coughing, would worry about a lung collapsing be realistic? Could it effect your heart if you have aortic problems?\n* What discrimination/bullying have you faced because of Marfans? What privileges do people without it have that they assume you have? \n* Are there medications, prescribed or over the counter, or supplements you're unable to take? Are there any you find yourself taking frequently?\n* What are your exercise limits? Would a walk to the store in very hot, very cold, or generally inclement weather be out of the question?\n* What daily mundane things do you find yourself requiring assistance with?\n* Are hyper-flexible joints a big issue? What kind of issues do they cause?\n* (you definitely don't have to answer this one. if you don't want to publicly feel free to message me. I'll keep your secrets \ud83e\udd2b\ud83d\ude09) How does Marfans effect your sex life?\n* Is there anything you do daily to help alleviate Marfans related symptoms or symptoms of the medications? \n* Do you receive government assistance or disability?

This is horrible for anybody but especially for my mom, the sweetest, funniest women who has always had good health before this Loeys Dietz bombshell was dropped on our lives\n\nToday, on the same day we learned that her kidneys were finally healing and she will probably be able to come off dialysis, we learned that the dissection has caused an additional overgrown aneurysm in her descending aorta which is also inlarged and they think she will have to do another open-heart surgery.

Here is my story:\n\nI have worked 2 years as a metal sheet worker, where I used a grinder above my head to grind down welds. I did not notice any problem with my collarbones then.\n\nThen, I started with weight lifting. I started doing the military press where you lift the bar above the head. After some time, I noticed my collarbones did pop in and out (subluxation), when I did this excersice. I went to the doctor, and she suspected Marfans Syndrome or Ehler Danlos. I underwent eckocardiogram, physical exam of my body etc. and wanted to send me to a genetic test. The genetics declined the appointment because there wasn't enough basis to complete a genetic test because its expensive. And I haven't got any real answer of why my collarbones are popping like they do. I haven't had any injuries as far as I can tell, other than the one time I landed with my whole body weight on my arm, cause I slipped and broke a bone in my hand, but thats it.\n\nDoes anyone here have any thoughts they will share on my case? Like, why is my collarbones like this and who should I talk to? Im still afraid I could have Marfans or EDS.

I took contact with my doctor, that sent me to a specialist within connective tissue disorders like EDS, Marfans etc. She said my collar bones were popping out because of subluxation (joint hypermobility). She then took tests of me and this is what she found and wrote down about me:\n\n\\- 190 cm tall and 71 kg\n\n\\- My skin doesnt bleed easy and doesnt get bruises either\n\n\\- I have piezogenic papules on both feets\n\n\\- I have hyper ext. elbows\n\n\\- Beigtens score: 2/9\n\n\\- I have retrognathia\n\n\\- Doesnt feel more tired than anyone else\n\n\\- Nearsigthness with astigmatism. I'm not very nearsighted, just -0,75 and -1,00\n\n\\- Never had dislocated lenses or any other eye issues\n\n\\- No one in my family have had connective tissue disorders or died before 50\n\n\\- Pectus excavatum\n\n\\- Wrist sign positive, thumb sign negative\n\n\\- I do not have flat feets\n\n\\- Not crowded teeths\n\n\\- Never had punctured lungs\n\n\\- I haven't had any heart issues\n\n\\- Arm span ratio normal (0,99/189cm)\n\n\\- Mild scoliosis\n\n\\- Some hypermobility on the tip of my fingers\n\n\\- Stretch marks on lower back, stomach and inner thighs (I grew so fast in 9th grade, weren't rly tall before.. so I think my stretch marks are rom the rapid growth and my stretch marks on the inner thighs are from weight liftings as I grew good muscles in my legs the last 3 years)\n\n\\- Been playing football and did weight lifting last years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe doctor then sendt me for a check to echo cardio, and he didnt find anything. My aorta and all my valves were normal. I then asked the doctor if I could get a genetic test but I couldnt. She said it wasn't any basis to make a genetic test, as she thinks I just have hypermobile joints in my collar bones, and that I dont need a check up for my heart every year. Conclusion: I do not have marfans or any other disorder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on my case? Personaly, I dont feel safe.

My take home however, was that my Cardiologist wanted me to try cutting my dosage of Nadolol in half (from 40 - 20 mg once daily). My resting was 42BPM at its lowest. \n\nI suggested to dose down over two weeks from 40 to 30 then 20mg as I had tried cutting it in half before as she had advised and went back up to 40 after a while because I was getting heart palpitations through the day. This was quite a while ago though, close to 10 years.  Anyway- she agreed I could dose down gradually and said that I\u2019m pretty low energy and it\u2019s probably just what I\u2019m used to so I don\u2019t notice it. I do like to think I\u2019m pretty calm most of the time.\ud83d\ude1b I do a lot of conciliation breath work too so that may also be a factor. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with their resting heart rate being as low as 42BPM? Have you changed medication (with the advice of your doctor) to bump your heart rate up closer to 50 or 60 and did you notice a difference in your energy levels after?\n\n I also get fluid retention in my feet a lot and wonder if it might help to reduce that. No doctors I mention that to seem concerned about it. They think it could be because of my hear function but no one has taken a second glance at that. \n\nAnyway- thanks for reading.

I might've begged for a surgery I didn't even need 5 years ago because of what those other doctors said.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1378, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I think I have flat back syndrome from Harrington Rods.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/lxf7i0/i_think_i_have_flat_back_syndrome_from_harrington/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Neat_Nature9179", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_aocu51fx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1614747769, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/lwls3b/suicidal_thoughts_because_of_marfan_syndrome/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lwls3b", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/lwls3b/suicidal_thoughts_because_of_marfan_syndrome/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1614902621, "score": 17, "selftext": "Hello everyone. I'm 22 and yesterday I recieved my positive genetic testing for Marfans. I had several physical symptoms but just wanted to confirm. The thing is that since I got my result I became extremely depressed because I am affected by my body dysmporphia of being so tall and underweight accompained by the facial features. Added to this, my heart isn't in the best conditions, nor is my spine. \n\nThe thing is that I am not longer excited for a life in which I am condemned to a body that I hate and to health issues that will make me suffer and eventually kill me in the future. Because of this I have become suicidal, which is new and shocking to me, I never despised my life before. \n\nThe reason for this post is to ask you guys whats your take on the syndrome regarding the life quality vs someone without the syndrome. I know I'm exaggerating by being suicidal but it is just my initial reaction, I think it is a blessing that I have family, can walk, see, hear, taste, have all my limps and many other cool things. But still, I'm in emotional pain like never before and I would really appreciate the insight of people who have already accepted the medical condition. Thank you and if you felt offended by this post I apologize, my intention is not to disparage marfans, but to understand to cope with it myself.

I am a 20f who was tested a couple of years ago for Marfan Syndrome. I had some physical features but not enough to conclusively diagnose me, so I also got an echocardiogram (which came back normal) and a genetic test (which was negative). I have mild myopia but no other eye problems. It was recommended that I follow up in a few years to make sure nothing had changed with my health. Last week, I followed up with a genetic doctor to receive more information about the test and its accuracy, but the doctor decided to redo the physical examination and concluded that I have Marfan or another connective tissue disorder.\n\nWhile I appreciate the second opinion and am open to further testing, I think the doctor went about it in the wrong way. First of all, what was supposed to be an informative session about genetic testing turned into to 2+ hours of him examining my body and continually using words such as \"deformed\" and \"abnormal\" to describe my physical features. He also constantly compared my features to his own describing mine as \"abnormal\" and his own as \"normal\". When explaining certain characteristics to me, he used internet pictures of people with pretty severe skeletal features of Marfan and essentially implied that all people with Marfan look like that. Finally, after concluding that I have Marfan or another connective tissue disorder he recommended an echocardiogram but did not give me any further information about what that means for my health and my future. There is lots of information online, but, left to my own devices, I tend to spiral into worst case scenarios about my health. \n\nDo others think I am overreacting about how the doctor handled this situation? I felt like he was not very kind nor supportive throughout the process, and I left feeling infinitely worse about my body and my health than I had before the appointment.

This is why I need to be able to justify bugging her and her parents to do so. Is it necessary? l know this is against the rules and if a moderator takes me down, i totally understand. But this isn\u2019t where she can just go to the doctor. She\u2019s gonna have to jump through hoops to get her abusive parents to take her. Is it worth the backlash she might face, or should we wait until after college to pursue this?\nMy cousin has Marfan\u2019s and I\u2019ve learned more about it during nursing school. For privacy reasons, I\u2019m not going to post her face her, but it does look marfanoid. Sort of longish, flattish, downward sloping eyes- I\u2019m not really sure how to describe it. \nThe other day I noticed her tallness, but more so just the length of her extremities. She\u2019s 6\u20190 and she has long arms and legs and even longer fingers. So i asked her to tuck her thumb under and she showed positive for the Steinberg sign.

She has crowded teeth and is nearsighted. Her back seems a bit crooked, like scoliosis. Not too much of a curvature, it seems (I have scoliosis and it\u2019s bent and looks similar to mine)\nI don\u2019t want medical advice.

I've had a myriad of symptoms I've suffered from for most my life but in the last 3 years, these symptoms have worsened and my health has seen a general decline. In the last year and a half or so it has seen a pretty massive decline and I can hardly function as a normal human being anymore. I live a relatively healthy lifestyle, eat mostly FODMAP, GF and vegetarian diet, do light exercise, stretching and walking, and don't do any drugs or alchohol, just cannabis for helping with appetite, pain and nausea. \n\nI am 28 yrs old, transsexual woman, 5'10, and 112 lbs. I take estrogen, spironolactone, escitalopram, dronabinol and was on propranolol for a few weeks but just stopped due to severe side effects. I've been diagnosed with gastroparesis, gastritis, scoliosis, POTS and waiting on MCAS diagnoses which the doc is pretty certain I have. Recently my cardiologist (who I'm seeing for the POTS diagnosis) asked if I had EDS of Marfans due to my appearance. I'd never heard of those before, but being tall, skinny and my arms, legs and fingers being so long, he was suspicious. He measured my arm span and it was longer than my height. I can  wrap my thumbs around my wrist to overlap with my pinky and ring fingers, I can touch the ground with the palms of my hands and can make the prayer hands sign behind my back. He was thinking I could very well have eds or marfans. I would pursue testing for both these things from my primary doc, but am moving across country in a week so have to wait to get a new doctor in Pennsylvania. \n\nMy symptoms include - general malaise and soreness, severe underweight and unintended weight loss, always tired, sore joints, nausea and stomach upset, lack of appetite, Low BP (usually in the 80s/40s), very easily triggered motion sickness, slight tremors in hands, light headedness and dizziness, weakness, pain and difficulty walking upright due to my knees and back feeling too weak/hurting and feeling dizzy from blood rushing outta my head, much shortness of breath from even talking too fast or walking across the house (not like asthma/throat closing up, just cant seem to get enough oxygen), sometimes my knees and fingers get \"stuck\" and I have to \"unstick\" them or they wont move out of that position. For the past 3 or 4 months, Ive had the most insane night sweats, I will wake up 2 or 3 times totally drenched and have to sleep with towels in the bed. I also sweat pretty much constantly now, whether its hot or cold. My hands and feet can be like frozen ice, but sweat like crazy. I can also be freezing and shaking in the middle of the oregon winter, but sweating profusely. This was shocking as my whole life I've never sweated as much as I do now, even after living in the hot and humid south. I'm completely and totally miserable. \n\nI am keeping hydrated and trying to eat more smaller meals, trying to keep up exercise and moving even though everything is hurting and I'm pooped all the time. I've increased the salt in my cooking by quite a bit and also take salt tablets. I wear the tight stockings and get up slower after being seated or lying down. I'm really trying everything the docs are recommending but I just seem to be getting worse and worse and loosing more weight. \n\nSo far, the docs have ruled out MS, Fibromyalgia, CFS, TB, anemia, diabetes and thyroid issues. I don't know what else to do or where else to turn other than eds or perhaps marfans at this point. Does any of this sound familiar to you? I just don't know why I'm getting treated, following docs orders, but still continue to get worse to the point where i'm seriously starting to ask myself if I'm dying (of course we're all dying, but maybe I'm just now on an accelerated path?). I can't work, I can hardly eat or take care of myself, the dog or the house anymore. I'm not even 30 yet and don't know why I'm deteriorating so quickly :( Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated, thanks.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false,

I\u2019ve set up an appointment with my pcp and am currently waiting an appointment time. \n\nAlong with the chest pains, I was also born with an indented chest, I am tall and skinny, always been flexible and can pull my thumb behind my hand, I\u2019m nearsighted, I have stretch marks on my back, along with a few other things that I\u2019d found through research are common signs of an individual having marfans. \n\nI\u2019m by no means self diagnosing myself, but I\u2019m a worry-some person with a history of mental health issues and I\u2019m prone to existential crisis. I understand people can lead happy and healthy lives living with marfans.

Having read the guidlines and such, I feel like clarifying this is a question on personal experience and not about diagnosis. I'm currently in college and have quite the pedestrian commute compared to what I used to and came across this subreddit. Since I don't know anyone else who has Marfan Syndrome, I figured I'd ask about something I have had a problem with in the past.\n\nFor context, my university is built on a large hill, and as such there is a lot of steep uphill/downhill commuting. My first semester here, my gen-ed credit classes were spread all over the campus, so I'd start at the bottom of the hill in the morning and make my way uphill throughout the day. This led to me having a collapsed lung, but it was treated fairly quickly and I got back into my routine just fine. Currently, now that I'm onto my major courses, my commute is not nearly as severe, but I still struggle with it sometimes.\n\nSo, as for my question, how do you all decide if you're just feeling the discomforts that can be fairly normal (in my case, being out of breath, pain in my lower legs and back, elevated pulse), and serious signs of danger (my primary concern being heart issues, even though I've never shown abnormal aortic growth, but my anxiety makes me dwell on the possibility)? So far, my rule of thumb has been \"discomfort means stop and rest, pain means something is wrong,\" and it has worked well so far, i.e, the collapsed lung. But since I've never meet anyone, aside from my family and cardiologist, who are aware of Marfans, much less have it, I figured I'd ask here what people who have it look for when they think something might be an emergency.

I'm currently going through the diagnostic process for Marfan's, however in my country if you have a genetic disorder it either takes a lot of money and/or years to get a solid diagnosis. My GP is fairly sure I have it and has confirmed the features in my younger brother too. Having had some past spinal injuries, I'm no stranger to chronic pain, however I've been experiencing widespread moderate to severe joint pain during my first year of university. I've had to quit my job due to pain and fatigue, getting through labs and lectures is really hard, and overall I've been slipping into hopelessness and despair. All of my specialist appointments are months away and my psych won't help as it's a physical issue. My joints ache, and my muscles feel like taut knots around painful areas. I can't sleep and I've lost my appetite. I've had to depend more on my family than I've ever had to before since moving out, seeing friends and making plans takes so much energy, and it seems like all I ever talk about to people is the pain I'm experiencing. Having experienced severe depression in the past (with no related physical pain), I know these feelings of hopelessness and guilt are a slippery slope but I can't seem to help myself. I've had so many side effects from pain medications this year that my doctor is reluctant to find something that helps without a specialist's opinion. Is this kind of pain normal for Marfan's, and do any of you have any advice on how to cope/treat it?

The surgeries were successful and I was recovering rather well. But recently I\u2019ll been plagued by this fog like feeling with lightheadedness that has been just terrible. I had a dizzy spell about two weeks ago and laid down to prevent passing out. I thought it was the high doe of metoprolol I was on. 75 mg 3 times a day. I kept calling the clinic telling them I\u2019m still suffering and they claimed that it can happen after this sort of trauma. My problem with that is I was really good for most of September. Only in October had I started having a constant feeling of something not quite right and funny in the head. So I got switched off metoprolol and started on atenolol. \nThat was last Thursday when I went to the ER. I had an ekg, ct scan of aorta, labs and an X-ray. Everything was good. So me and the doctor both kind of thought it\u2019s probably the meds let\u2019s switch it. So we did and I started on atenolol. For about two days I felt much better and got better each morning then the feeling came back but not as severe. But still noticeable where I wasn\u2019t myself at all and was pretty worried. So I talk to my cardiologist and she says to stop taking it and we will figure it out Friday during my appointment. My blood pressure is amazing through all of this but historically I have an electrical issue so I do need some kind of medicine for that. I haven\u2019t been without a beta blocker for 10 years. \nSo today at 11am was 48 hours since my last dose of atenolol to try to rid beta blockers out of my body to see if that was the problem. But while I was feeling better thinking it\u2019s definitely the beta blockers I was a little more active and moved around more. But it wasn\u2019t much because I have been way more active in my time of recovery. But I started to get a neck pain and then I felt myself get really dizzy and had to sit down before passing out. \nMy neck has been hurting threw all of this and some have suggested c1c2 sublaxtion. \nMy head has a little pressure on it but not really a headache. And it isn\u2019t constant. \nI\u2019m pretty fatigued more than usual. \nI yawn a lot during the day. \nWhen I wake up I feel the fog but still slept my usual amount of 8 hours. \nI feel a little shaky in my legs and arms at times. \nMy appetite is down but idk if that is the anxiety or a symptom. \nFeels like the flu or something like that but I don\u2019t have a fever. \nDid anyone have a similar experience ever at any time or after a surgery especially a double? It may be related or it may be something different even environmental. I really need help I\u2019m at my wits end. Nothing is worse than this thing I\u2019m experiencing.

Many of you feel discouraged about finding a partner, typically because of how Marfan Syndrome makes you look. So let's talk about that.\n\nFor my part, I'm older. I have a beautiful wife, and two equally beautiful children. But like many of you, I was also frustrated by how difficult it was to date people. Most were not attracted to me. I looked different. I get it. But what I also discovered is that this phase only happened when I was young. Young people are superficial. It's nothing against young people, I was one myself once, but it's just a typical (but not always true) fact. It's the hormones, it's the incredibly competitive culture that school can be, it's lots of things. Once you move beyond all that, people start maturing. People start looking at you for who you are, and not how you look compared to all the others. This is the stage where you will see an uptick in people who are interested in you. But here's the thing: you need to love yourself first. If you do not, they won't either. People love other people who are confident, kind, and respect themselves and others. That can be harder for us because we just went through this entire stage where no one was interested in us, so if they aren't interested, maybe we're not worth the love? Codwallup. Fiddlefaddle. Enough of that chicanery. Other old-timey phrases.\n\nSo my salient points are these:\n\n1. Be patient. As you get older, so too you'll find that people will be more interested in you.\n2. Love yourself. If you aren't happy with you, no one else will be. \n\nAlso, be funny. That also really helps.

Not asking for a diagnosis just advice \n\nI\u2019ve been dating a guy for almost 2 years and the first time I saw him I thought he looked like he had marfans. Over 6 ft tall but under 120 lb, which makes his BMI less than 16, he has depression but not an eating disorder, he also has mild scoliosis, a swayback posture that can\u2019t be corrected with muscular tension, and there seems to be a depression in his breastbone (I\u2019m not a doctor and have never seen an x ray of it but I can feel there is a concavity in his chest.) He is very lanky with long fingers and toes and seems to have a fast heart rate (again I\u2019ve never actually counted but it sounds fast to me). However, his eyesight is pretty good and he isn\u2019t very flexible.\n\nOne time I went with him to the doctor, who insisted on checking his thyroid (even though it apparently gets checked every year.) Nothing wrong with his thyroid, as usual. I wanted to ask if he\u2019d been checked for marfans but I figured the doctors would have thought of that and didn\u2019t want to hear from a nerdy dumbass with no formal medical training. So I kept my mouth shut.\n\nAfter the appointment however, I started thinking about myself and how doctors never realized I had Asperger\u2019s until I asked them about it, doctors misdiagnosed pain from my nighttime bruxism as an ear infection and doctors had refused to test me for Lyme disease (which I had) until I explained what it was to them, so just from my experience I\u2019ve met several medical professionals with tunnel vision. I\u2019m not even sure if the doctor would heed my worry if I was to voice it, but I kinda wish I\u2019d said something anyway.\n\nHe was 20 at the time of that appointment and is now 21. Is it possible for a lifelong genetic condition to go unnoticed and undiagnosed for over 2 decades? I know the only definitive way to check for a genetic disorder is through genetic testing, but how many criteria must be fulfilled and which is the most important criterion to identifying it? And what precautions (like regular EKGs) must be taken until/unless he can be genetically tested?\n\nTLDR NOT ASKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS, just if it is possible for someone with some but not all criteria to be diagnosed later in life and how important it is to get medical treatment for it. He does not like going to the doctor so I\u2019d have to convince him if I think getting him tested is worth his time.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied":

First time posting here. I got referred to genetics for suspected ehlers danlos but the geneticist thinks I may have marfans rather.

My arms are longer than my body and my hands are long and I am thin and I can do the finger/fist test thing. I have hypermobile and unstable joints,  brain aneurysms, cavernomas, arterial ecasia, fusion of some of my vertebrae, other vascular defects, mild scoliosis, moderate sponyolisthesis and retrolisthesis in my spine, cervical cranial crowding, flat feet, navicular syndrome, mild Pectus carinatum. But like it\u2019s all really mild-looking. Like I\u2019m just in a lot of pain but you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell. And then the aneurysms are a problem obviously so I\u2019m getting brain surgery but they just think there\u2019s some underlying issue. \n\nSo i have a brother who does look like he has marfans though but he doesn\u2019t have the hypermobility. He hasn\u2019t had any imaging done so he doesn\u2019t know if he has other issues. But the geneticist wants to test him also.

I weighed the least I ever did at that time and little did I know my pain was just beginning. it was a hellish year \u2014 I would develop body-dysmorphic disorder and hardly ever left my house or room for fear of how people saw me and their judgements of how I looked. Every day I was miserable because I so badly wanted to look \u201cnormal\u201d and the intense realization that I would never be able to \u201cfix\u201d it was too much for me to handle which left me suicidal. In retrospect I am grateful I hadn\u2019t the tools to take my own life, and god knows I would have if I had the resources to.  \n\nIn June of 2020 my continual, intense pain inspired me to look deeply into the world of fitness, our condition, and how I could reconcile the two together to safely achieve an aesthetic that made me comfortable in my own skin. It wasn\u2019t easy. Our limitations are very, *very* restrictive in terms of muscle building because the vast majority of muscle building exercises or methods raises blood pressure, which as you know, is very bad for us.  But guess what? I didn\u2019t care. I thought \u201ci\u2019m going to hate myself forever, I should just lift, because even if I die it would be better than living like this.\u201d but yet in the back of my mind a fear of aortic growth and dissection was always there, so I would still attempt to pursue a safe routine, however the pain and the strong desire to look aesthetic was too powerful so I ultimately didn\u2019t care. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnce I was read up on bulking and how to lift weights safely with our condition thanks to the many awesome members of this subreddit that chimed in, I began to lift. Now, I will say this, I did achieve my goals. 3 months in and I was fit which over the next few months crushed my BDD as well as insecurity. For the first time in what felt like an eternity I felt happy, healthy, and confident. People in public and in general respected me more and were friendlier, I could finally wear shirts in public, everything was great, **but I still had that thought at the back of my mind that my aorta could be growing**. \n\nAs I kept lifting and lifting, getting bigger and bigger, I would frequent the popular marfan facebook group which had its share of members that felt the same shame, misery, and hate that I felt about myself for so long. A lot of these members would go on to lift as well with the same worry that growth might be happening, but like me, this didn\u2019t dissuade them from powering on. I remember a picture of a teen lifting a barbell that looked like it weighed a lot and people were trying to tell him to put it down. I scoffed at these people - \u201che\u2019s killing it, he\u2019s muscular and happy, how could these people tell him to stop?\u201d and jumped in the comments to show my support towards him. I was all for lifting with marfans, and I would even get in arguments in the group about how it\u2019s really important to lift. \n\nAs you know, I was being an ignorant jerk at that time, egging on a young man to risk his life over something silly that he didn\u2019t need to do. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTonight, a powerful realization came to me after a day of anxiety about my aorta growing: **I don\u2019t need to do this. I don\u2019t need to put my life on the line anymore to please others. I\u2019m happy with myself. I have marfan syndrome, i\u2019m exempt from these activities, I don\u2019t need to put pressure on myself to look a certain way, I don\u2019t need any of it.** and then I made the decision. to retire from lifting. My health and well-being is more important than being muscular. It wasn\u2019t worth it for me, and when it comes to our health and safety, it likely isn\u2019t for you, either. \n\nMany people here often post up asking for advice on how to build muscle and a lot of the replies are just downright dangerous in the long run. I also know how many people here struggle with insecurities and depression about how they look, but i\u2019ve been to the other side, and let me tell you: **You\u2019re a beautiful person, and a syndrome does NOT determine your worth or value.** NEVER let anybody tell you or convince you otherwise.\n\nI know this is a lengthy write up, but I think its  important for at least someone here on a similar path to see this.

I feel so out of line over-analyzing this, but I can't help it.\n\nSome background, or why I started thinking along these lines (not for medical advice reasons, just context): his physique always struck me as extraordinary. Nothing extreme, just that there is a cohesiveness to his attributes if that makes sense. Then I got familiar with Marfans, and something just clicked. He meets some of the criteria, some not. Haven't 'examined' it closely, would be over the line, but it's impossible to not notice certain things, and it would make sense if it was Marfans. His family on one side follows a pattern of some attributes not present in everyone, but a majority. So it's  vague, and way too easy for someone with a mind like mine to run away with, but I wouldn't call it ungrounded.\n\nI have talked about it with him once, and was planning on leaving it there. I addressed my concerns so that he had a possibility to take a stance in regards to his own health. Good, I thought, now I can leave it up to him and support him however he choses to deal with it. We haven't talked about it since. But then I recently learned one of his relatives suffered one of the more extreme symtoms of the disease, and it all flared up again. I feel so bad that my mind went there and made something else out of what he told me in confidence, something that can be explained for many other medical reasons, something thatI should be able to trust health care professionals to screen for in these instances. *But I just can't stop worrying.*\n\nI would be so grateful for some perspective on how you would like someone in my position to handle this.

Im always feeling hopeless, depress, unmotivated, and hope that the world will end ASAP cause I\u2019m tired and done with this life. That was the biggest mistake I\u2019ve made and I\u2019ve wasted the last 20 years of my life doing nothing, but having depression everyday. I failed my studies and achieve nothing impressive out of my career.  I have all the major hallmark of marfan syndrome. Tall and lanky, thick eye glasses, cant gain muscles, pectus, etc . I\u2019ve completed countless of surgeries. I\u2019ve done open heart surgery with a mechanical valve to fix my bulging aorta (On-x heart valve) and undertook 4 surgeries to fix both my eyes. 1 time on left eye, 3 times on the right eye. The reason for 3 times surgery to my right eye was because of the lousy and inexperience doctor. I was lucky it was finally fix back by a more qualified doctor. Before eye surgery, I\u2019m not much different to a blindman. I can\u2019t see distance object clearly, i cant drive at night.....my glasses was thick as hell and still doesnt help much. But after the surgery, boy.......was i in for a big surprise....I never thought i\u2019ll have a chance to see with such clarity in my lifetime(even without wearing glasses!!) the first thing i noticed, after my eye surgery, was when looking at the sky and noticing how the clouds was so much different and beautiful this time......with all the detail, colour and contrast as the sun light bouncing off it......before this.... clouds look just like a few lump of wool to me. I wish I\u2019ve done this surgery earlier, if i know how much of a big difference it can make....... if you can see clearly, even after wearing thick glasses, I recommend everyone to do eye surgery. I\u2019m on 2 medication daily. Warfarin for my mechanical valve, and irbesartan to lower my blood pressure. I recommended everyone to take \u201c arb\u201d medication because it did help me to gain weight. This is not a medical advice, but i do hope you guys can explore this and try it out and see whether it help u guys to gain weight or not.\nThats all for now, if you guys have any question, feel free to ask away and i will try to answer them", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1337, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My life story so far.....", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/km0a6b/my_life_story_so_far/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "vor_tex03", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6jdwdz8t", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1609175404, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/kludgx/i_need_a_bit_of_help/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kludgx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/kludgx/i_need_a_bit_of_help/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1609175415, "score": 1, "selftext": " I just found out about mardan syndrome.

The lens in my eye is detaching. When my PCP learned this, he started doing Marfan\u2019s physical test. I do have scoliosis, but it is not severe. I am 6\u20195\u2019\u2019, 7\u2019 wingspan. I also have flat feet. As of last week, I learned that my aorta is dilated, also learned that I have congestive heart failure. The mitral valve is not prolapsed, but it is regurgitating, and the aortic valve is regurgitating. The PCP and cardiologist both believe that I have Marfan\u2019s, but I have to wait for the next month's genetic testing. I have an MRI scheduled to get a better view of the heart to compare with the echocardiogram. I know each person's presentation is different. How do you all manage this long term, and is it stressful or forget about it over time? Thanks for any response.

I had some spectacular developments concerning extreme pain associated with my Marfan's suddenly disappearing, however I could be an \"outlier\". But I figured starting here might help me identify who I should pass this information onto at the foundation, and where I could go to find out if others experienced the same phenomenon as myself. Again, take your meds as directed by your doctors, I could be a 100% unique outlier.\n\nSo to give a quick, blunt characterization of my pain: after standing for 1-3 hours, the next 3 three days the pain in my ankles would like clockwork be so excruciatingly bad that if felt (sorry for the graphic nature of the description, but it really felt this bad) like my ankles were being held on by mere strands of tendons and felt like they could break off at any moment with every step. While holding a phone to my head for only a mere 5 minutes, my arm would lock into place, particularly around the elbow (the tendons or ligaments or joints inside that is, just like my ankles). It would take nearly 5 minutes to relax my arm back to normal for regular movements again and any attempt of forcing it down sooner, again, felt like it would literally snap off. Extremely, extremely, debilitating pain. Sorry if that all sounds dark, it just was what it was for me and I'd wish it upon no one. This type of pain was full body, and those are relatively small or light activities I described doing. It only got horribly worse the larger or longer the activities. It would literally stop you in your tracks and take your breath away... BUT it was so normal I got used to it and used to hiding it because it was my daily life since about 12 years old (may not be a coincidence). I'm 32 now. Saying that life felt like daily torture, would not be an exaggeration, and I couldn't possibly understand how true that was until it went away.\n\nAll that pain went away nearly overnight. It seemed almost like a miracle, an answer to prayers that I didn't even pray for anymore. I thanked and praised God for it. I took atenelol since 12 years old when I was diagnosed with marfans and added in losartan around 20 yrs old when those research trials began showing promising results. Extraordinary pain remained until about 29 years old. It went away, almost miraculously, seemingly overnight. I could breathe better even, energy was higher than I ever remember experiencing in my life. So what changed? Standing for mere hours causing horrific pain for days to then suddenly be able to start Hiking 10 miles a day, carrying at least 100 pounds of equipment, something I wouldn't have even dreamed being possible in my life. So what changed?\n\nAt the time, I couldn't pinpoint it. But I was overjoyed. It wasn't until around Christmas time last year that I took atenelol again (this was the factor I wasn't able to pinpoint and was a blindspot for me). I took only half a 25mg dose &amp; all that horrific pain I described flooded back almost instantaneously (witin 24hrs). I found my trigger. It was the atenelol, the beta blocker. I tested this many times to discover that it was in fact the catalyst for MY horrific pain. How it works, and why it works to cause such pain in me, I do not know. But it seemed like a godsend when my pain first went away at about 29, but could not pinpoint what it was until 31. DO NOT SUDDENLY STOP YOUR MEDS based on what I'm saying. Atenelol itself has an extremely nasty rebound effect on the pulse when suddenly stopping it, regardless if you're a marfans patient or not - it's dangerous for anybody to do that, SO DON'T. I tapered myself down and off of it around the age of 29 for reasons I won't mention here. But I stayed on my full prescibed dose of Cozaar/losartan (25mg b.i.d.).\n\nSince it was such an amazing answer to the worst side effects of my marfans (extremely, extremely horrible pain, exhaustion, low energy levels, etc.), I wanted to share it in case others suffered their most extreme pain like myself, due to the atenelol. Again, I might be 100% unique on this. This might only be me who's suffered so much only to find out the cause was the beta blocker I was taking. It could be unique to my genes only. But in case it's not unique to just me, I felt it was my duty to share it, and also ask for help about who I should pass this onto at the foundation in case they might find this useful.\n\nLast PSA - if this turns out to be true for anyone else, it's only cause for celebration. No one could have known this, and the doctors have done extraordinary work for us and aiding us in our battle with marfans. Essentially I'm saying, don't blame anyone if this turns out to be the cause of all your most horrific pain as it did mine, because no one is to blame. No one asked for marfans. It's none of our faults. And every doctor I've known since finding out I had this syndrome have gone above and beyond and deserve our thanks only for that.\n\nThank you for listening, and may God bless all of you and your family's. \n\nSincerely,\nJustin Jones\n(623)810-2128\nText first if you plan on calling so I can know who to expect - lot's of automated calls (most likely political) as of late as you can imagine.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1293, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Marfans Patient w/extreme Pain Gone (almost) Overnight", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/k44nqi/marfans_patient_wextreme_pain_gone_almost/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Pepper1135", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3gwvkn8o", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606758202, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/k40s18/how_attainable_is_a_normal_life/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k40s18", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/k40s18/how_attainable_is_a_normal_life/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1606758213, "score": 1, "selftext": "Currently undiagnosed, but doctors suspect I have Marfans.

My doctors dismissed this and said that it couldn't be caused by the contraceptives and instead I was tested for early onset arthritis (negative). After much self-experimentation and some research I've found out that progesterone (the active hormone in mirena / Jaydess and the mini-pill) is very bad for those with hyper-mobility. It seems the same is true for Marfan's.The progesterone released during pregnancy enables the mothers body to adapt to the pregnancy and birth by loosening the ligaments. **For those with connective tissue disorders this can cause extreme discomfort.**\n\nI just wanted to post this here in case any other women have the same symptoms and are disregarded by their doctors. Fortunately for me, I eventually found a nurse who believed me and am now using the copper coli instead of the hormonal one). If you are experiencing these symptoms and have marfans / hypermobility maybe find an alternative contraceptive method before it gets as bad as it did for me. And of course, tell your doctor.\n\n**Question:**\n\nIf any marfan suffering mums are reading this I would be really interested to know about your experiences during pregnancy. Were your joints extremely painful or do you think this is more caused by the levels of progesterone used in contraceptives?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1286, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Progesterone &amp; marfans contraindication", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/jwhx09/progesterone_marfans_contraindication/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AbelG12", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_i60aj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605692513, "domain": "self.marfans", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/jwcxqp/what_ethnicity_are_you_guys/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jwcxqp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 35, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/jwcxqp/what_ethnicity_are_you_guys/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1605709622, "score": 3, "selftext": "I\u2019m Mexican and from southern United States and was diagnosed when I was 5.

I spent hours reading through posts from various age ranges. I am a 29 yo female who was diagnosed when I was just a few months old. I don't know what life is like without marfan's. Ever since I was a little kid they were monitoring something. First it was my scoliosis, then my aorta. I had my spine fused when I was just about 10 years old. Thankfully the human brain is resilient and I can say happily that I managed to forget a lot of that horrible 3 surgery process. Just last year it finally came time to have surgery on my heart. I almost had surgery when I was 17 years old, but something odd happened, not totally explainable, and I was pushed back into the waiting line.\n\nBeing a teenager with marfan's was certainly a difficult task. I think one of the hardest things was that I was the only one. I knew that there were obviously others out there, but I never met anyone else like me. Briefly I met one older boy when I was in the hospital when I was 10, but we never kept in touch. I think that was one of the biggest things that could have made the awkward time of puberty easier, was having someone else to talk to about it.\n\nI read a lot of posts from those younger with marfan's and I can feel a lot of the same things I went through. Due to having marfan's I developed depression and anxiety throughout most of my life. I started struggling with chronic pain when I was only 15, and that is what kicked off the a lot of my mental struggles. Looking back, I wouldn't blame anyone in my shoes, it was rough. I wanted to come on here to say that it does get better though. I learned to embrace who I am and I now wear my scar on my chest like a medal of honor. I battled through it, and I finally get to be in a place were there is no anticipation, no middle of the night anxiety that a momentary odd heart beat was \"it\".\n\nI wanted to come here and reach out a virtual hand. If you ever need a fellow marfan's beholder to talk to, I am happy to listen. I'm no doctor, but I have certainly been through the ringer and can tell you what I did to deal with this that and the other.

I am a 30 year old Loeys-Dietz patient. I have been an active member in this group because of the similarities between Marfans and Loeys-Dietz. In 2017 I completed my aortic root replacement surgery. Since then, I have had a number of migraines (never experienced any before surgery). My cardiologist mentioned that migraines are common for post-op patients but they still do not know why. My question to you all (maybe those who have experienced the same surgery) is do you also get them? And if so, any recs on coping with or preventing them?\n\nI have experienced them after strenuous (I know I'm not supposed to be doing this) activity. My most recent one was yesterday after a bike ride with lots of hills. It's not a huge issue because they are rare and they seem to be brought on after activity, but I have had a few that were random.

I'm not freaking out about the surgery (yet) but I'm worried about this procedure because I don't want anything to happen since I'm so close to getting it all fixed.

I've got the whole pack: scoliosis (2nd grade), chest convex (barely visible, but all the doctors always ask about it, mild case as well), Mitral valve prolapse, TMD and of course quite flexibel joints. I've seen already many posts about the weight and why ist it that difficult to gain something. I would like to tell my story about it and then ask you all a question. \n\nI'm 6.2. with the weight of 61 kg (just a year ago i was 64). I was always happy about the thing, that i can eat whatever I want to, and gain absolut 0. But then, as many of us, I've started noticing things, and decided to become a school jock. Sweet Jesus, it took me like 3 years. I've been training 3-4 times a week and ate a quite a lot, counted all the calories, that I consumed and so on. But the attempt was unsuccessful. Well once I actually did succeed and gained like 5 kg during 6 months. I was amazed, but then i suddenly got a flu and was sick for a week and a half and lost 6 kg. I can't express my dissappointment at that particular moment, when i checked my weight. Anyways after this I've decided, why should I even try and eat 3000-3500 Kcalories per day. I just won't have such an Apollo body.  Whatever. \n\nBut more and more common I face the problem of my BMI. For example if I would like to get the job, I have to do a medical for this job. My BMI is out of healthy range and it will be much better if I can get like 5-7 kg. I am pretty sure, that it will help the immune system as well. \n\nSo did you succeed with weight gain? If so, what was your story and how much time/energy did it cost?

It also stated negative wrist sign however this confused me as I thought it was positive given my thumb fully covers the entire finger nail of my fifth finger. \n\nFBN1 screen was negative with \"no known causative mutation found\"\n\nI queried with the geneticist the positive wrist sign in a letter and questioned whether this would indicate MASS Phenotype as the Ghent score would be &gt;5 and Marfan.org seem to indicate this as a positive differential diagnosis when Ghent score is 5 or more. \n\nThe geneticist stated that MVP is key to MASS and as no MVP was detected I would not have MASS and therefore future periodic screening is not required. The MASS factsheet on marfan.org seemed to state that MVP \"may\" be present with MASS and that scans every few years are recommended although I appreciate I may be misreading this.\n\nAdditionally to confuse matters the clinic seemed to indicate that they had seen my maternal cousin however they have no record of a confirmed diagnosis of Marfan in my family, but due to data protection were unable to discuss my cousin's records. The family tell me this is not true and that he is 100% confirmed and his sibling had to be screened who was thankfully given the all clear. Unfortunately my cousin has fallen out with the family and is uncontactable for now to clarify things.\n\nI know most of this is good news but I'm left with doubt in my mind, especially as my mother passed away at 26 and there was an inconclusive post mortem for cause of death and her father died from a heart attack and emphysema albeit older at 75 but I recall reading that lung conditions like this are linked to connective tissue disorders.  \n\nI don't know whether to just forget about the whole affair (I am 44 so would most likely have more symptoms by this age) or ask for medical records with a view to a potential second opinion just in case but I feel I wasted enough people's time already. I appreciate many of you have far worse problems than this and apologise for sounding unappreciative of the positive cardiac result and wondered if anyone has any words of wisdom?

I didn\u2019t mention anything at the time and brushed it off beacuse it kinda scared me, but I knew a lot of the symptoms matched me. I\u2019m tall, 6ft (granted my parents are tall), I have flat feet and struggled with a lot of pain as a kid till I got insoles, my feet are also really big like a uk 9/10. I had a huge overbite because of my small jaw that had to be corrected, and also the roof of my mouth had to be widened. My chest is slightly convex and I have often times near passed out when doing strenuous excerise. I had to have surgery on my toes cause they were curled over and my fingers are long and easily overlap around my wrist. Though the only issues I\u2019ve had with my eyes is I\u2019m slightly short sighted but not enough for glasses.\n\nAnyway recently I\u2019ve been going to the hospital a lot for pain in my abdomen and weight loss to have scans and such and on one of the visits I decided to finally ask if it was a possiblity. They did a few physical tests and asked some questions and said it was a possible and confirmed I was hyper mobile and refered me to a cardiologist, geneologist and optition. \n\nThen a few months later I booked an appointment at my gp since i also have issues with my legs getting painful when standing too long, and it was starting to become a problem. I was also starting to get quite a lot of pain around my joints and while manageable I thought I might as well also go for that aswell beacuse I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to help when it got bad or prevent it worsening in the future. I mentioned I was getting tested for marfans and that it might be related and I had some blood tests to rule out other conditions, which all came back negative. In the consultation my gp said he didn\u2019t think I had marfans after only asking about if anyone in my family had it (which I don\u2019t think so but in 25% of cases I thought there was a random mutation) and the height of my parents (mum 5\u201d10 dad 6\u201d3), he didnt ask about my other symptoms. He then went on to say he thought I was just very anxious since I had also been in about a random pain in my side that\u2019s affected me over a year and a half now and has been accompanied by 18kg of weight loss. Then said that \u201cI\u2019m just a normal girl\u201d and \u201cI shouldn\u2019t let this stop me from doing anything\u201d and that \u201cthis is when he\u2019d tell his daughter off for being too anxious\u201d. 1 how does having health issues make me not \u201cnormal\u201d?, 2 my pain is holding me back since I cant wait in a line for more then 5 minutes and my job oppunitys are a lot smaller and 3 I\u2019m not overly anxious I\u2019m just concerned and need to know if I have this condition since I have to make lifestyle choices and it will effect my potential children and I also wanted some advice on how to manage my pain. I didn\u2019t say this as to the point as now however and he kept asking \u201cwhere my confidence went\u201d and this confused me more since I didn\u2019t feel anxious and I didn\u2019t feel my confidence changed but he kept saying that over again and that I was an \u201canxious girl\u201d, it could be my tics making me seem nervous but I wasn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m now just really confused, immediately I wanted to just cancel all my appointments and felt so stupid for even going to the doctor in the first place. I haven\u2019t but now I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any real concern here or if I have been too anxious with my health.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1549, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I\u2019ve been referred for testing for marfans but my gp said he thought I didn\u2019t have it", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/p24a2q/ive_been_referred_for_testing_for_marfans_but_my/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "fascinatedobserver", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_513so", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1628287678, "domain": "labroots.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/ozgqee/reversing_the_heart_damage_seen_in_marfan/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ozgqee", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/ozgqee/reversing_the_heart_damage_seen_in_marfan/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "link", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "R9ifn8ljrZC8OvT7BofMdASJ7NPh-jEYpahLnky7N2M", "resolutions": [{"height": 72, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MS6xE5RIPhA-IaqEae7vR5fLc1Z1WYDtuKZ_Z0-GExg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e90003790f43ffa9ee6707739e8d39f3db36856b", "width": 108}, {"height": 144, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MS6xE5RIPhA-IaqEae7vR5fLc1Z1WYDtuKZ_Z0-GExg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4d6ad55dedf9e472d8ee5940945a0256d439f41", "width": 216}, {"height": 213, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MS6xE5RIPhA-IaqEae7vR5fLc1Z1WYDtuKZ_Z0-GExg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bce282ed4a792c44a7420e3ef320f8d876d72cf9", "width": 320}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MS6xE5RIPhA-IaqEae7vR5fLc1Z1WYDtuKZ_Z0-GExg.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a9352d82fd670a838b20e5053f47e8187e11932", "width": 640}, {"height": 640, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MS6xE5RIPhA-IaqEae7vR5fLc1Z1WYDtuKZ_Z0-GExg.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33bf59869b4a76e4f92141498475d15eaf238f20", "width": 960}, {"height": 720, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MS6xE5RIPhA-IaqEae7vR5fLc1Z1WYDtuKZ_Z0-GExg.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0103cb2c64e01b5ef8249a1892fd1cfe627a3252", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 960, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MS6xE5RIPhA-IaqEae7vR5fLc1Z1WYDtuKZ_Z0-GExg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=725047eac2b8b15433b15e3867f63cea6f3365df", "width": 1440}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1628287689, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1543, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/G7d08nRNByBKinOJBMOcaF2XvZuyn-mR93AL0D_qPsU.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 93, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Reversing the Heart Damage Seen in Marfan Syndrome | Cardiology.

Some claim I am straight oblivious, but I simply breath reality and the reality is that I have been depressingly alone for so long that I cannot believe that any of these situations are truly what they claim they are. I'm used to being pittied, being a charity case, toyed with, etc. I have always had the sense of being less of a being.\n\nAlso, I'm one of those \"proper\" autistics, I cannot force myself into a non-picture perfect situations. For example, I cannot employ a prostitute due to the lack of desire AND lack of a legitimate relationship. Even though I am a virgin, I cannot enter into acts without commitments. I have to be polite at all times and I am very reserved when I do have naughty things to say; it makes me uncomfortable.\n\nI have recently been 'sweet-talked' by a girl I've know for 3+ years. Shes understanding of my quirks and alot of her flirting is straight forward so I'm able to understand her just fine. \nWe talked about alot of different aspects of what a relationship might look like and the things we could do together. All of the things we could do with each other.\nI'm ready for this, to be treated the way I want to be and to finally be let inside societies best kept secret.\n\nI'm not concerned, myself, over my physical marfoid structure; like I said, I'm going to live. I may be a sporadic case, I may be randomly Julius Caesar'ed in the chest. But I can run decently, walk for miles without stopping, stand for hours on end, carry upto 120+ lbs, etc.\n\nShe is worried, though, that sex might kill me. She is afraid my hips will break, back will snap, I'll dis-joint something, or my aorta will go pop, etc. \n\nHow can I reassure her that I'm going to be fine?

We don't owe anyone handsomeness or muscles or being sporty or looking or acting in a \"masculine\" or \"manly\" way.\n\nYou are all beautiful and handsome and fine as you are. The people with the problem are those who would judge us on our body shape and not our contribution to the world, not us.\n\nI would like to also say that things get easier as you get older. Young people are going through a lot of changes and it's a confusing time. This confusion often gets dealt with in mean or unhealthy ways and I promise you that most people grow out of it. I also put on some weight in time, developed my interest and style and made loads of friends who shared my interests.

I\u2019m scared It might be too late to do something I have a doctors appointment Tuesday but every day I my chest pain gets worse.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1504, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Finally going to doctors office to see what\u2019s going on.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/o8j4xo/finally_going_to_doctors_office_to_see_whats/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ThirdMusketer", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9yy87kw6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1624656746, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marfans/comments/o7x2we/should_i_be_tested_for_marfans_i_have_small/", "gildings": {}, "id": "o7x2we", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/marfans/comments/o7x2we/should_i_be_tested_for_marfans_i_have_small/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "o_a1WJ6myu--aIO9xEJfd3vQp5wVKAvEYMxydkAcbRU", "resolutions": [{"height": 144, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/vnokgxy3dh771.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af2bd3457dc417adef55523c04f24bfe50ef2252", "width": 108}, {"height": 288, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/vnokgxy3dh771.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4db21050d45b6a9aef25b9460e6085e7de5c33a9", "width": 216}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/vnokgxy3dh771.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3735a4f19c4a95288426142816586745a6ae0cb8", "width": 320}, {"height": 853, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/vnokgxy3dh771.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04543aaf577b504708a9d37d8603c9589b961a1c", "width": 640}, {"height": 1280, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/vnokgxy3dh771.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d8a67511be4e0ff34e3f2818e0d59398eb8b88d", "width": 960}, {"height": 1440, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/vnokgxy3dh771.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0bb29dbdb20e4ae2e47a028446342d770b2e485", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 4032, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/vnokgxy3dh771.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=92055e003f734ab039881433d3c4faeb6a5845f8", "width": 3024}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1624656756, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "marfans", "subreddit_id": "t5_2se3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1502, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9Q2nBG1tx1NNaWcSWxh6S_PsX3jyKVLHo455fq4hSo4.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Should I be tested for Marfans?

This is because the nerves that control ejaculation run along the aorta and during the repair they were damaged. I only learned this later on when I was seeing a urologist, but many urologists will recommend that patients freeze sperm before having an abdominal aneurysm repair because of the potential damage. \n\nThe second problem I encountered because of this surgery is that it lead to several additional surgeries. Since the original procedure I have had a complete abdominal reconstruction surgery and a muscle plication of my lover right abdomen. 2 completely different surgeries with months of recovery time and rehab in between and I am just wrapping up my recovery now.\nThis is all because us marfan patients are blessed with weak connective tissue.

I\u2019m a 39/F with Marfans. Had surgery last year to repair my mitral valve. Aorta is looking good, I\u2019m monitored closely. I had scoliosis surgery when I was 14. \n\nAbout two years ago my body went insane. What started as neck pain morphed into me barely being able to walk, because my hips were in excruciating pain. I was diagnosed with Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, meaning they think I have this but none of the actual markers to confirm it show up in my blood tests. Prior to that they tested me for West Nile, Lyme disease, etc., all negative.\n\nI\u2019m currently having my second \u201cflare\u201d in the past three months. Yesterday my shoulder muscle hurt, and a few hours later I was screaming in agony like I was being stabbed (I\u2019ve been through a lot, I can handle pain, but this pain was almost making me pass out). It hurt to breathe. I went back on the prednisone I took last time, at my doctors instructions, so the pain is manageable right now. \n\nThis is all say, I\u2019m not convinced this is arthritis, and neither are my doctor and rheumatologist, but they are at a loss. I\u2019m wondering if this is tied to Marfans in any way. This is my long way of asking if anyone has been in a similar situation, or had similar pain? RA affects the joints, and while I have as some joint pain, it feels mostly muscular. Has anyone been diagnosed with RA? Or been misdiagnosed? Just looking for any info I can find.
