I just found this subreddit and had a few questions that I'd like to put out there. My boyfriend was just diagnosed today at age 24, after being misdiagnosed with MS in August. If you would like to answer any or all of my questions, I would be really grateful. \n\n1) How soon after your initial attack were you diagnosed?\n\n2) How long have stays been at the hospital? The neurologist told my SO today that he should expect to be in the hospital for 2-3 weeks, with rehab to follow. \n\n3) Any tips or tricks for the upcoming hospital stay? How have you been best supported by your loved ones while you've been going through treatment? \n\n4) Are you taking medications after being initially diagnosed and treated? \n\nThanks in advance!

I feel almost like I did back before being diagnosed 5 years ago, when I was trying to hide my symptoms, especially at work.

I'm fighting every day through this fatigue and at times complete exhaustion. But I keep pushing myself. I can't afford not to work. I can't see a neurologist about it, because I don't have insurance anymore. I could go to the ER, and they might do and MRI scan. But I can't do another plasmapheresis treatment after the trauma of last time at that hospital. I won't. That surgeon that put the catheter going into my heart didn't give a shit! about the pain he was inflicting; he just kept trying to jam it in with his soulless determination.

I wanted to share what I\u2019ve been going through and maybe get some advice. \n\nFor the past year or so I\u2019ve felt really run down. Not the typical \u201cworking too much\u201d stuff but so tired that it was hard to keep my eyes open at all during the day. I kind of thought I might just be depressed after lockdown but I\u2019ve been clinically depressed before and this feeling was very different. I started feeling unusual pains on the left side of my body and noticed that when I wld be reading or looking at something, I\u2019d do it with one eye closed. I have contacts and have had the same prescription for over 3 years and thought maybe one eye had gotten worse and I just needed a new script. \n\nI then noticed intense muscle spasms on the left side of my neck and into my head (behind my ear). I started getting unusual headaches that felt more like pressure on the front and lower back of my skull. The left side of my head tingled and itched a lot and I noticed that I was getting pins and needles in my hands and feet even if I didn\u2019t have them in positions that caused that before. \n\nI went to a walk in clinic and they said I had a mild fever and asked me if my eyesight had altered. They gave me a quick test and I noticed that my left eye wasn\u2019t only seeing worse, it was dimmer. Like a piece of tissue was over it. Colors were less vibrant as well. \n\nThe same night I noticed that the right side of my low face started to droop and I went to the ER. I\u2019m only in my early 40s and eat very healthy and have never had any sort of major illness in my life but they checked me for a stroke and of course my MRI came back with no indication of a stroke. At this point my ears were killing me,I was having double vision, brain fog and confusion. They diagnosed me with vestibular neuritis, released me and said I needed to follow up with a neurologist. \n\nOnce released, I developed a very high fever (103) and my hands arms and legs started to go numb with little shock waves. I noticed I cldnt ouch my toes and was putting all of my weight on the fronts of my feet. When I wld lean back on my heels one eye wld go blurry and then go back to normal. My shoulders burned like I had never felt before and the tinnitus and headaches were worse than I\u2019d ever had. The heat from my body wld start in my left ear/ head/ neck and circulate around my face when I would put ice on it. I went to the ER again thinking I might have meningitis. \n\nSecond trip to the ER, they did a spinal tap and more blood work. CSF fluid came back with no meningitis so I was released again w instructions to see a neuro. Neuro was booked for 3 months so I went to my PCP. Most of my blood work came back totally normal except I tested positive for ANA. The PCP basically blew me off and said I needed to see a rheumatologist and have more MRIs to check for MS. \n\nA few days later I went to the optho because my eyes were hurting so badly and were incredibly photosensitive. I went and took a peripheral exam and it indicated that I had optic neuritis. I was sent to the ER right away and got an emergency MRI of my orbits which showed less CSF fluid in my right eye (was shocked it wasn\u2019t my left) so i was admitted for more testing. \n\n6 MRIs and another spinal tap later they determined I did not have MS and there were no signs of lesions on my spine. My eyesight got even weirder: I wld see things move when they weren\u2019t and geometric shapes wld kind of vibrate. The tremors I have had for 15 years in my hands were worse and I cldnt walk on my heels. They sent my CSF fluid to the lab to test for myelin protein and NMO. I was released with a diagnosis of NMO while I wait for the antibody test to come back. It\u2019s been 3 weeks and no test result although I tested negative for myselin protein. \n\nSymptoms still persist and I\u2019m just so damn tired of these doctors treating me like I\u2019m crazy and not listening to the entirety of my symptoms.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "NMOdisease", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bcru", "subreddit_subscribers": 197, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Diagnosed but still awaiting antibody test.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NMOdisease/comments/rswzgp/diagnosed_but_still_awaiting_antibody_test/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "4ACEDROP", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_83t7g6nk", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1638429168, "domain": "self.NMOdisease", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NMOdisease/comments/r71o45/nmo_and_vaccines_and_rituximab/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r71o45", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/NMOdisease/comments/r71o45/nmo_and_vaccines_and_rituximab/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1638429178, "score": 1, "selftext": "Mom has been in the hospital cause of covid for a month now one of the doctors said that because of the rituximab she shouldn't have gotten the booster vaccines it may have made it worse.. he didn't explain how I know rituximab is an immunidepresent but wouldn't it be a good idea to get the booster vaccines?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "NMOdisease", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bcru", "subreddit_subscribers": 190, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Nmo and vaccines and rituximab", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NMOdisease/comments/r71o45/nmo_and_vaccines_and_rituximab/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "KnordicKnitter", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2p7uijkv", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1637530895, "domain": "self.NMOdisease", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NMOdisease/comments/qz55ys/hand_controls_for_cars/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qz55ys", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/NMOdisease/comments/qz55ys/hand_controls_for_cars/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1637530906, "score": 1, "selftext": "This past year, I undertook the task of getting hand controls for my Prius.

Each person had to evaluate my (dis)abilities &amp; sign off the  paperwork.  There is a special company that makes wheelchairs &amp; does hand control installations close by.  It was so liberating to be able to drive myself after 14 months.\n\nMy situation was caused by neuropathy in my feet caused by damage from MNO to my spinal cord.

She's like this go-to resource for the regular neurologists--I think they consult with her about treatments etc.\n\nPlease feel free to post sites you enjoy to perhaps help your friends here.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "NMOdisease", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bcru", "subreddit_subscribers": 150, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do you follow other patients' stories?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NMOdisease/comments/nk4ate/do_you_follow_other_patients_stories/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "KnordicKnitter", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2p7uijkv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1621036387, "domain": "self.NMOdisease", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NMOdisease/comments/ncmay8/have_you_written_anything_or_produced_any_art/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ncmay8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_metadata": {"udzgw2stb6z61": {"e": "Image", "id": "udzgw2stb6z61", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"u": "https://preview.redd.it/udzgw2stb6z61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6266feb022fa1486266921f90301ee4a2d9f7097", "x": 108, "y": 160}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/udzgw2stb6z61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2390c3aac8260c6447f7c0162a0e9de604213d4e", "x": 216, "y": 320}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/udzgw2stb6z61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab4f02977bbd8ccc66299da49812799b2427d00b", "x": 320, "y": 475}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/udzgw2stb6z61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=804d4d13fda289ef52afeca4f1282ee7f4f71316", "x": 640, "y": 951}], "s": {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/udzgw2stb6z61.jpg?width=934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98c8d88f2b82ed80c3407e00ba7671ea87c3f57e", "x": 934, "y": 1388}, "status": "valid"}}, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/NMOdisease/comments/ncmay8/have_you_written_anything_or_produced_any_art/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1621036398, "score": 1, "selftext": "...related to your illness?

His next course of action is to switch me over to oral immune suppressants by july-august 2021 and I\u2019m feeling overall uneasy having to think of this disease thats always seemingly at the back of my mind. Want to know if any of you out here are off of rituximab and how your overall experience is -\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* how old and when were you diagnosed? what were you attacks/attack like? when did you first get treatment and what did they give you? \n* did you also have to make a switch from a more intensive treatment like rituximab to a more blanket immune suppressant? what was your experience with the different treatments like in the longterm or just on a day to day situation?\n* did you make a lot of changes in your lifestyle? what advice could you give me to further improve on myself? \n* mothers and potential mothers on this group who have been diagnosed- what was your experience like with pregnancy and childbirth? How did the NMO affect you during and after this time? and what was your experience with it and the medication if you had to be on anything? i know this is a difficult topic but it is something that has caused many sleepless nights for me. I know I want to have a child with my wonderful husband at some point when we both are ready. but everything online seems very scary, whereas my doctor\u2019s very matter of fact about \u2018its okay well think about family planning next year\u2019 \n\nMy background: I(28F) was diagnosed with NMO back in May 2015. with most of my symptoms being transverse myelitis (lesion that was found in C4-5 vertebrae) and very very minimal (almost unnoticeable) affect to my optic nerves. the transverse myelitis symptoms however was pretty scary and I honestly don\u2019t know in retrospect how i handled everything that followed that year. By the time i had my first rounds of rituximab i had already had a second slightly more severe attack/lesion by the end of the year. thankfully the steroid course in both situations were administered almost immediately and I was soon on a steady road to recovery. \n\nIt\u2019s since been 5 years, haven\u2019t needed to take steroids since 2016 and have been doing my rituximab infusion each year (between 8-10 month intervals) Pretty much all my motor functions are back. I do have other issues which at this point idk if its because of the long term effects of the drug itself, or the sickness or if its age or just other random circumstances. stuff like slight hormonal imbalances, a nervous gut, feelings of anxiety and for a while, fainting spells. But I do recognise my immense luck considering how much strength and control has been regained. I\u2019ve mad massive strides in taking positive action towards a healthier lifestyle ; eating more often as I\u2019ve always been underweight, eating healthier and more well rounded meals, meditation and mindful yoga practice for the past 3 years, giving myself a healthy break from work initially and now working as a freelancer to get some leverage on how i spend my time, cut down from being the reckless party-person i used to be in uni (no more recreational drugs, and only very very occasionally will have a bit of alcohol and a cigarette) It\u2019s been a lot of little changes that I\u2019ve tried to make bit by bit in the last five years, and it isnt easy even today but I do feel a positive change in me to a large effect. I do have my moments of self doubt and anxiety when it comes to my health and what I should allow myself to be/do because of memories of how helpless and out of control i felt in 2015-16. And a major portion of this anxiety right now comes when i think about how this disease spectrum affects my ability to have children\u2026I have the sweetest most supportive husband; he and i started dating not long before my first attack, and our relationship though thoroughly tested, has only grown since then. we got married last year and we both know we\u2019d love to have kids of our own if the time came and if we were lucky enough.\n\nI\u2019d be grateful to hear some of your stories since your diagnosis! I haven\u2019t ever openly spoken to another nmosd person before and would love to get some insight from some people here!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "NMOdisease", "subreddit_id": "t5_3bcru", "subreddit_subscribers": 128, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "to other NMO patients who've been diagnosed a while ago", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NMOdisease/comments/kb0gsq/to_other_nmo_patients_whove_been_diagnosed_a/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Celestine47", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_690qjoh9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606691297, "domain": "self.NMOdisease", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NMOdisease/comments/k3jkju/leg_issues/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k3jkju", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/NMOdisease/comments/k3jkju/leg_issues/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1606691308, "score": 1, "selftext": "I wanted to know if anyone could relate to this.
