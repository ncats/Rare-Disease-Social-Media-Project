At the time I was frustrated there wasn't a subreddit for people dealing with SBS.  I created one today and thought this would be a good way to start it off.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI wrote this mostly for theraputic reasons, but I thought I would share it with hopes that it helps out some other Dads (or Moms) out there who may be in or find themselves in a similar situation.\n\nMy name is Remo. I\u2019m a thirty-four-year-old software developer, a gamer, and a guitar player, but mostly, I\u2019m a Dad. My daughter, M, is five years old now. She was born prematurely at 28 weeks and was 1 pound and 13 ounces. She was tiny, but she came out fighting. I was always one of those guys who shied away from holding other people\u2019s babies and I never really knew how I would react when I had my own to look after. The nurse took me up to where they had my tiny daughter in this plastic chamber. They told me I could put my hand in and touch her. As soon as my hand was in the chamber she reached up, grabbed my index finger, and pulled it tight to her chest. In that moment I knew what it meant to be a Dad. I would have thrown myself in front of a bus just to have her healthy and at home where she belonged.\n\nShe did well in her first few weeks, but as the doctors started to try to feed her it quickly became apparent that something was wrong. Her belly swelled and she couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom. Tests were run and it was determined they needed to do surgery on her belly. She was diagnosed with Necrotizing Entercolitis (NEC) and they had to operate to remove dead intestinal tissue from her stomach. My wife, N, and I were devastated. Our world was shattered. As a father, so many thoughts run through your head. What if I never really get to know my daughter? Why can\u2019t I protect her? What will happen to me and N if we lose her? Will we ever be the same?\n\nThankfully, after a couple of surgeries over a couple of weeks, all of the necrosis was removed and our baby girl was on her way to gaining weight and coming home. She spent four months in the NICU. N and I were lucky enough to be able to visit her daily. We became closer as a couple through our experiences because we only had each other to lean on.\n\nOver the next three years, M had some minor issues. She was diagnosed with mild cerebral palsy. It only affected her left side muscle tissue so she had to wear a brace on her foot and go to physical therapy. She also had spent so much time in the NICU laying on one side because of her incisions, that she developed a flat spot on her head. She had to wear a helmet for about 6 months, but it rounded out nicely. Nothing we couldn\u2019t handle. We were so proud of our little fighter for all of her accomplishments and we were always eager to see what was around the next corner.\n\nOn March 2, 2016, N and my Aunt(who took care of M while we worked), took M to her first dentist appointment. She did great and she also used the potty successfully that day. They decided to take her to a store and let her pick out a prize for good behavior. While there, M said she needed to go to the bathroom. N took her back to the restroom and M used it again. Once again, she said she needed to go. After a few times of this, M started screaming in pain. They decided to take her to the ER a couple of blocks away and let them have a look. N called me and I met them there.\n\nWhen I arrived, M had calmed down some, but was still in significant pain. The ER doctor assumed she just had a stomach virus so she gave her Zofran and told us to just wait it out for a while. I was sitting on the bed with M in my lap when a tech came in to check her vitals. He immediately ran out of the room after looking at her and brought in a nurse. M\u2019s situation was getting worse quickly. After that they made us all leave the room so the doctors would have room to work. Several doctors, including M\u2019s original intestinal surgeon from the NICU, came in and we were left waiting outside the room.\n\nAfter what felt like hours, but was probably closer to ten minutes, a nurse came out and told us that M\u2019s heart had stopped and they were doing chest compressions. My world collapsed. It was like an out of body experience. I could see myself sitting there sobbing and felt like I was a million miles away from anyone. I couldn\u2019t speak, I couldn\u2019t think, I couldn\u2019t do anything but cry. Eventually that just turned into a blank stare and numbness. The nurse finally came back and said that her heart was beating again, but within a few minutes it stopped again. After the second time she was revived she finally stabilized somewhat but was critical. They still didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her. The ER doctor pulled us aside and told us she had about a five percent chance of making it through the night. Once again, our world was shattered. I don\u2019t remember much about that night. It is just a fuzzy dream to me.\n\nMiraculously, she made it through the night. She\u2019s a fighter. After imaging and scans showed nothing, M\u2019s surgeon told us that he needed to do an exploratory surgery, but it was high risk due to her still being critical. He proceeded with the surgery and found that M\u2019s intestines had looped over on themselves and cut off the blood supply. It was a freak thing that no one could have predicted. He removed a significant amount of intestine and left her stomach open. He would go in the next day and clean up and close her wound. The next day of surgery produced more bad news. Even more of her bowel had died and had been removed. She was left with less than one percent of her intestine and a third of her colon. N and I sat in the room with the surgeon and we all just cried.\n\nI had so many thoughts race through my head. How do you go on from this? What will her life be like? Can she even have a life? How do you survive without intestines? And of course, why can\u2019t I protect my little girl? The first time was hard, but this was worse. Now we knew what we were losing. It wasn\u2019t just this tiny new baby, it was a person. We loved her. We loved her personality. We loved her sweet little voice. This was our daughter and it wasn\u2019t fair.\n\nWe stayed in the ER for a few days until we were transported to a larger children\u2019s Hospital. They sent us there in case M needed dialysis due to the trauma that had occurred to her kidneys. M was still unconscious, so we hadn\u2019t been able to see our baby girl awake after all that had happened. We had so many concerns. Would she ever wake up? Was she going to be the same person? Was she going to have brain damage or lasting neurological effects? No one had answers for us.\n\nWhile there, we were told that M would probably be on TPN (an IV nutrition) for the rest of her life. We weren\u2019t really told what this meant. I was picturing her being bed ridden for the rest of her life. I was at the lowest point I had ever been. And this is the point I want to make here, so I\u2019m going to take a little break from M\u2019s story and talk about the thoughts you have as a Dad. \n\nNot enough people tell the Father\u2019s that it\u2019s okay to not be strong all of the time. We\u2019re expected to soldier on.\n\nWhen I was given the news about M\u2019s intestinal condition, my heart sank. I felt like the most selfish person on the planet. I thought about M being bed ridden. I still didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever be able to speak or take care of herself. I had thoughts of suicide. I wondered if it would be better if it all just ended there. I had thoughts that maybe it would be better if she didn\u2019t pull through. Would I be better off if she didn\u2019t just hold on to this bit of life? Would she be better off if she just never woke up and had to deal with any of this? Would my wife and I stay together? Could we ever possibly recover from this if she didn\u2019t make it? Could we take care of a child that would never be a normal kid or adult?\n\nI\u2019ve come to realize that it\u2019s okay to have these thoughts. They don\u2019t make you a bad person. They don\u2019t make you a selfish person. The mother of your child is probably having the same thoughts. But as a man, you feel like you can\u2019t have these thoughts and you sure can\u2019t talk about them. You can\u2019t show weakness. You are the father and the husband. Your job is to protect your family. But in this moment, you can\u2019t. There is nothing you can do to protect your family and that is the hardest thing to come to terms with. What makes it even tougher is the well-meaning family and friends. They tell you that it\u2019s God\u2019s plan or that it all happens for a reason. They tell to keep your head up because at least you still have your child.\n\nThey are wrong.\n\nYou may still have your child, but that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t allowed to grieve. Grieve for the life and normalcy that has been taken from you. Grieve for the life and innocence your child has had taken away. Grieve for all of the things that have been unfairly taken away from you and your family. Grieve for as long as you need to. When you\u2019re finished grieving, that\u2019s when you will be able to step up and start being a father again. It\u2019s not selfish. It\u2019s not wrong. You\u2019re not missing the big picture. It\u2019s natural, but only someone who has been through it will ever understand it. Talk about it. There are support groups, professionals, and most of all, the other parent. She is the only person who will ever come close to knowing how you feel in that moment. Don\u2019t be afraid to let it out.\n\nBack to M\u2019s story. Did I mention she\u2019s a fighter? After a few weeks of being unconscious, the doctors decide it\u2019s time to start weening her off of sedation and pain medication. We were living at the hospital with her and one day the nurse asked us to come in because she was moving around. I walked in the room and the first thing she said was, \u201cDaddy, what happened to me?\u201d I was crushed and relieved all at the same time. She could speak. At least part of her is still in there. But how do you tell a three year old what\u2019s happened? I told her that her tummy got really sick and the doctors had to work on it. She rolled over and went back to sleep.\n\nOver the next months, while we waited for M to recuperate, we learned about the ways our life was going to change. M wasn\u2019t allowed to eat. Instead, she was going to be on IV Nutrition 24 hours a day. The pump and IV bag would be housed in a backpack that would keep her somewhat mobile. Of course, it\u2019s like half her body weight, so she couldn\u2019t wear it and we would be responsible for moving it around for her. There was also learning how to take care of her central line and G-Tube, setting up getting her supplies, and everything that went along with it. This whole situation had really flipped our lives upside down, but we were ready to get our daughter home.\n\nWe\u2019re now about two and a half years removed from the initial issue. We\u2019ve had good months and bad. She has had numerous line infections, surgeries, and hospital stays. She has been evaluated, but isn\u2019t a candidate for a transplant. But she\u2019s also started kindergarten, and though she needs a little help every now and then, she\u2019s doing great. She is also off of the TPN for 8 hours a day, but still needs it for 100% of her nutrition. She had her first trip to the beach, and thanks to a special dry-suit, she was able to go swimming in the pool and the ocean and had a blast.\n\nN and I also have our good and bad days. A lot of that hinges on how M is doing. But there are still those moments when she\u2019s bouncing around happy like a normal five-year-old and you see that IV port hanging from the bottom of the shirt and you just want to ball up and cry or put your fist through a wall. But slowly, the good days are starting to outnumber the bad. We\u2019re learning how to deal with and work around our limitations. Taking care of M is a lot of work and sometimes as parents you take out frustrations on each other, but you have to stay strong and remember that the other parent is going through it with you.\n\nM is the type of kid who is so good natured and makes a lasting impact on anyone who is fortunate enough to spend time with her. She is a testament to the strength that children possess. She doesn\u2019t complain about her situation even though she knows she is different.

Though I was a very ill baby, a team of doctors at Cardinal Glennon Memorial Children's Hospital --and my infinitely loving and self-sacrificing parents-- saw me through to a healthy adulthood. I do not currently require feeding tubes, nor do I have an ostomy; although I do have kidney stones, my gallbladder was removed at age 14, and I continually struggle to maintain a healthy gut biome and sufficient levels of vitamins A, D, and B-12.\n\nHowever, I am alive!! I can work, I am married, I have no mobility issues -- to the outward observer, my SBS is easily hidden when it is under control, which is most days. I am extremely grateful for my quality of life and ability to do everyday activities without requiring medical apparatus or cycles of hospitalization and treatment, but am still learning about living life with short bowel syndrome with each passing day. My outstanding GI team runs blood panels and meets with me two or three times per year, monitoring stability and striving for continued success. Still, I often find myself wondering, \"*Is this normal for people with short gut?*\" and curious about what nutrition and activities work best for people who have their gut on their mind 100% of the time.\n\nI would love to share my story (and its many humorous and/or cautionary episodes) with other SBS patients, and learn from theirs as well, so that we may support each other with compassion and information, helping one another navigate our unique experiences living life with this little discussed but increasingly common condition.\n\nIn solidarity with all GI patients everywhere,\n\n\\-TCB-", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ShortBowelSyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_2e4iva", "subreddit_subscribers": 49, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "4 decades of living [pretty] well with Short Bowel Syndrome", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortBowelSyndrome/comments/onlrqs/4_decades_of_living_pretty_well_with_short_bowel/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dogsitter47", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_cvktsy2p", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626383285, "domain": "self.ShortBowelSyndrome", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortBowelSyndrome/comments/ol2016/anyone_on_gattex/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ol2016", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ShortBowelSyndrome/comments/ol2016/anyone_on_gattex/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1626383296, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi! I have Crohn's and UC. No large intestine left and have Short gut Syndrome, but enough small intestine to be able to eat solid food. My doc wants to put me on Gattex because I can't absorb nutrients or gain weight. I'm maintaining weight right now and I'm not on any type of TPN. Yay! I can pretty much eat anything I want. He also wants to start me on Entyvio. I'm concerned about starting Gattex. It has some pretty serious side effects and I seem to be the queen of side effects. I kinda enjoy eating all day and not worrying about gaining weight. I was on only TPN for 2 years and wasn't able to eat at all. So food is kinda a big deal to me. I also love to cook and stick to a pretty decent diet with protein, fruits and veggies since I can finally eat them again. I couldn't eat much fruit or veggies for years because of all my gut trouble. My one guilty pleasure is ice cream since I do need a little weight on me and it is summer time!!! But the Gattex is concerning with the ostomy blockage and appetite changes so I'm looking for people with experience with it. I do have a permanent ileostomy and a lot of inflammation in the small intestine. I have been through a lot and don't want aggressive treatment. I can expand if anyone is interested. I am on a maintenance dose of Flagyl and that does help me feel better. I don't have a lot of energy and I know the Gattex can help with that but the side effects do concern me.

emergency surgery to remove 75% of her bowel (12ft of her large and 3ft of her small). They just discharged her from the hospital yesterday and we are trying to set her up at home. She lives alone and needs TPN for 12 hours at night. We were told that either a specialized nurse must administer the TPN at night or a family member can do it. Unfortunately, my sister and I won't be able to stay with her long term and it seems like the only person (other than a family member) who is allowed to hang her TPN bag, is a registered nurse. Strangely, Medicare won't cover this service even though she really needs it and cannot do it alone. Has anyone navigated this situation and/or have any advice?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ShortBowelSyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_2e4iva", "subreddit_subscribers": 35, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My mother just lost 75% of her bowel - some advice would be helpful!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortBowelSyndrome/comments/m23l6i/my_mother_just_lost_75_of_her_bowel_some_advice/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Chumonka", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_85oe230o", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1615380551, "domain": "self.ShortBowelSyndrome", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortBowelSyndrome/comments/m1wqt7/what_medications_do_you_use_to_slow_down_digestion/", "gildings": {}, "id": "m1wqt7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ShortBowelSyndrome/comments/m1wqt7/what_medications_do_you_use_to_slow_down_digestion/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1615380561, "score": 1, "selftext": "For me lomotil, loperamide, and Victoza", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ShortBowelSyndrome", "subreddit_id": "t5_2e4iva", "subreddit_subscribers": 34, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What medications do you use to slow down digestion?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortBowelSyndrome/comments/m1wqt7/what_medications_do_you_use_to_slow_down_digestion/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Chumonka", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_85oe230o", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1615380414, "domain": "self.ShortBowelSyndrome", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortBowelSyndrome/comments/m1wpeq/what_do_you_do_for_hydration/", "gildings": {}, "id": "m1wpeq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ShortBowelSyndrome/comments/m1wpeq/what_do_you_do_for_hydration/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1615380425, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've got SBS and also a diabetic, so I use propel and I add some salt.
