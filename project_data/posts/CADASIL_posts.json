My dad is a 56 year old man. Over 200lbs and 5\u20199. \n\nYesterday afternoon he was outside doing yard work. My sister noticed he started staring off, like he was confused or something. She asked him if he was ok. He didn\u2019t respond. She sat him down and tried talking to him, he wouldn\u2019t respond. She called 911 and he was taken to the hospital. \nNow here\u2019s where it gets weird .. he became  violent. They couldn\u2019t control him. He was screaming. Fighting them etc. Completely unlike him. When they got him to the hospital they had to get 3 security guards to hold him down. He kept ripping his IV out and screaming. He then began vomiting and moaning in pain. When they tried talking to him, he wouldn\u2019t speak. When my mom got there he started swearing at her and wouldn\u2019t talk to her either. He was still completely freaking out. \nMy dad had a few mini strokes a couple years back. They did a Scan and said it wasn\u2019t a stroke.. however his neurologist apparently told him he may have cadasil syndrome. But the ER docs didn\u2019t think so. They said he had higher levels of ammonia in his liver but not high enough to explain his behaviour. Fast forward to this morning, he was basically his normal self again. He has no memory of what happened yesterday. They released him today because he was stable and they told him to follow up with his family doctor and they can\u2019t explain what happened to him. We\u2019re all so confused and concerned. He takes Effexor and has for over 20 years. They did lots of blood work. No drugs or alcohol in his system.

showed no conclusive benefit to the use of donepezil (Aricept) in patients with CADASIL. \n\nBut there are so few studies done and so few of us out there properly diagnosed. \n\nI know that anecdotal evidence is not always helpful, but my personal experiences with CADASIL and Aricept therapy is that research studies are not always able to perfectly recreate the full reality of the patient situation. \n\nFor me, Aricept gave me my mind back. \n\nThere are drawbacks: it won't last forever. Aricept is a temporary solution. In ideal circumstances it won't work for everyone. Where it does work, it will only work for a period of time. When it stops working, it won't work again. Upping the dose won't generally change anything. You get one chance. \n\nThere are things that help it be successful: being as fully involved in activities that engage the senses. It was suggested that I dive deep into interests and activities that involved as many of my senses as possible. \n\nIt hasn't been the easiest through pandemic and lockdown but it's been helpful knowing I'm not helpless. \n\nI'm going to post what's been helpful for my treatment here intermittently. Not because I think I have all the answers. Because there are so few sources of information out there. And because if there's a chance it might help someone else, I have an obligation. \n\nIn regard to the Aricept, doctors wanted me to put it off until the last possible moment - to preserve cognitive function in its last vestiges. When thinking, remembering, and simple things like conversation became near impossible I forced the issue. It has meant all the difference in the world these last several years.

Just seeing what it can do is pretty terrible.\n\nI thought my cousin was lucky because living in this time the disease is a little more understood and he knew what his triggers were (alcohol, aspartame, msg). But unfortunately that only goes so far. He is not quite 50 yet and had lost almost all of his peripheral vision. He was recently in a car accident where he required multiple surgeries, had a punctured lung, etc. Well, after a day or 2 in the hospital he had what's called a watershed stroke and basically has almost no brain activity now. I suspect the hospital gave him something they shouldn't have, but of course I don't have any way to know that. When he came into the hospital though he was alert, knew what had happened, knew who his mother was, etc and now he's just gone. Living off of machines now until they decide to pull the plug from what I gather. There is no hope of any recovery beyond living in a vegetative state in a wheelchair, and that's best case scenario.\n\nI'm just absolutely devastated. We all knew he wouldn't necessarily get as long of a life as he deserved because of the disease, but he'd had strokes and come back pretty well from them.\n\nI don't know why I'm posting this exactly, just wanted to get it off my chest. We are all pretty shook up at how quickly he went from just needing a few surgeries (wasn't in critical condition) to basically no chance of having a life again and realistically will probably be dead soon from it. \n\nFuck Cadasil.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CADASIL", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yhac", "subreddit_subscribers": 31, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This disease sucks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CADASIL/comments/8hsbrg/this_disease_sucks/"}, {"author": "kcirenim", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1520301914, "domain": "self.CADASIL", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CADASIL/comments/82bhi3/how_to_get_tested/", "gilded": 0, "id": "82bhi3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/CADASIL/comments/82bhi3/how_to_get_tested/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1520359343, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 2, "selftext": "Fast forward ten years...
