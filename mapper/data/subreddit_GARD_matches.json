While occasionally symptoms do disappear on their own, many people benefit from a variety of treatment options. Treatments for conversion syndrome include hypnosis, psychotherapy, physical therapy, stress management, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Treatment plans will consider duration and presentation of symptoms and may include one or multiple of the above treatments. This may include the following:\n\n&gt;* 1  Explanation. This must be clear and coherent as attributing physical symptoms to a psychological cause is not accepted by many educated people in western cultures. It must emphasize the genuineness of the condition, that it is common, potentially reversible and does not mean that the sufferer is psychotic. Taking an etiologically neutral stance by describing the symptoms as functional may be helpful but further studies are required. Ideally, the patient should be followed up neurologically for a while to ensure that the diagnosis has been understood.\n&gt;* 2  Physiotherapy where appropriate;\n&gt;* 3  Occupational Therapy to maintain autonomy in activities of daily living;\n&gt;* 4  Treatment of comorbid depression or anxiety if present.\n\nAll of this is directly stolen from the  Wikipedia page  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Conversion_disorder  on conversion disorder.

There are many causes of vulvar pain and vulvodynia is a diagnosis based on exclusion of other causes, and the aim is to rule out possible causes such as infections, skin conditions, or malignancies.\n\nFor provoked pain, the doctor will typically do a cotton swab test  as shown in  this diagram   https:  www.nva.org what-is-vulvodynia diagnosis    applying gentle pressure to various vulvar sites. \n\nAlthough sometimes there might be underlying issues such as pelvic floor dysfunction, hormonal deficiencies, or inflammation, often there is nothing to be seen. This doesn't mean that there is nothing wrong or that the pain is 'all in your head', but rather that it is the nerves themselves that are sending pain signals. Often women find that they have to see several specialists before they are diagnosed which can be frustrating. Please know that the pain is never in your head, and pain is never normal. \n\nYou might find it helpful to note down in advance of your appointment what your symptoms are, when do you notice the pain, and how it affects you. It is also helpful to ask whether they think it might be vulvodynia.\n\nThe Vulval Pain Society has produced a  pre-clinic questionnaire  http:  www.vulvalpainsociety.org vps images pdf vulval%20pain%20questionnaire%20inc%20diagram%20and%20desc.pdf  as well as  additional guides and leaflets  http:  www.vulvalpainsociety.org vps index.php downloadable-info2  to help you get the most out of your doctor's visit.\n\n**How is vulvodynia treated?**\n\nThe treatment of vulvodynia depends on the subtype of it and any associated factors  such as hormonal issues, or pelvic floor dysfunction . It's not about necessarily finding a 'cure' but rather about managing the symptoms and most women do get better. Some information can be found on the  NVA page on vulvodynia treatments  https:  www.nva.org what-is-vulvodynia treatment  \n\nBroadly speaking, there are three main approaches that are often combined together: \n\n* **Pain management and other medical treatments**: this includes topical numbing cream  usually lidocaine , oral medication, typically either tricyclic antidepressants  amitriptyline nortriptyline  or anticonvulsants  gabapentin pregabalin . These might also be available in topical forms in some places. \nIf the pain started after going on birth control, it may be worth going off the pill and using a topical oestrogen cream.\nSurgery known as a vestibulectomy is sometimes done where the pain is provoked, localised to the vulvar vestibule, and other treatments haven't worked.\n\n*  **Physical therapy  physiotherapy**: this treatment addresses the muscular components of the pain. Often women with vulvodynia have tight, overactive pelvic floor muscles and benefit from seeing a physical therapist who helps you learn to relax those muscles. Sometimes women have vaginismus  an involuntary tightening of the pelvic floor muscles  in addition to vulvodynia. An  explanation of the differences in treatment can be found here  https:  pelvicpainrehab.com female-pelvic-pain vulvodynia-female-pelvic-pain 5458 ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-vulvodynia-vestibulodynia-and-vaginismus  . You might be given dilators that desensitise the nerves and stretch the muscles. You also might be given stretches to do to release various tight muscles around your pelvic floor. Some women also find that certain types of yoga helps as well. Some more information can be found here about  physical therapy approaches to vulvodynia  https:  pelvicpainrehab.com female-pelvic-pain 4354 pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-vulvodynia  .\n\n* **Psychological therapy**: there is a strong mind-body connection in any chronic pain condition. This does not mean the pain is in your head! Rather, your brain is a powerful organ, and the more it perceives the pain as a threat, the more it amplifies the signals. Various psychological strategies can be used to help with this, such as mindfulness and CBT. Sex therapists may be useful if the pain is causing issues with intimacy.  This video  https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=-UqQ4c2m608  provides a detailed explanation of mind-body approaches to managing vulvodynia.\n\n**Self-help measures**: There are also steps that you can take to make treatment more effective, such as avoiding products that can cause irritation and looking after the vulval skin. Many women find using ice packs helpful during a flare-up. The NVA has a  list of self-help tips.  https:  www.nva.org for-patients self-help-tips  \n\nYou might find these guides on coping with living with vulvodynia helpful:\n\n*  Vulvodynia: A Self-Help Guide  http:  www.isswsh.org images PDF NVA.Self-help.guide.pdf \n\n*  Vulval Pain Society \u00e2\u0080\u0093 general good advice  http:  www.vulvalpainsociety.org vps index.php advice-and-self-help general-advice \n\n*  Living with Vulvodynia  https:  www.kcl.ac.uk ioppn depts pm research imparts Quick-links Self-Help-Materials Living-with-Vulvodynia.pdf \n\nThis list is not exhaustive and there is no one-size-fits all approach, so you might have to try a number of treatments before you find something that helps you.\n\n**How can I find a specialist?**\n\nThis depends on where you live. Typically you will have to see your doctor and ask for a referral to a specialist, and explain that you are suffering from vulval pain. A few resources below:\n\n**US worldwide**: The NVA provides a  list of healthcare professionals  https:  www.nva.org for-patients health-care-provider-list    both in the US as well as worldwide. You have to join as an NVA member, but the money goes towards funding the charity and research. It's mainly US-based but does maintain a register of specialists in other countries.\n\n**UK**: The British Society for the Study of Vulval Disease provides a  list of clinics  https:  bssvd.org patient-information clinic-map   that you can ask your GP to be referred to. The list is non-exhaustive and there might be others not listed, but this is a good starting point. \n\nIt's worth searching online for vulval clinics or doctors specialising in vulval conditions in your area. If you are not sure whether a doctor specialises in vulval pain you can always ask them, as not all doctors are experienced in managing vulvodynia.\n\n**Related Subreddits**\n\n*  r vaginismus\n*  r PelvicFloor\n*  r ChronicPain\n*  r Endo\n*  r Interstitialcystitis.

David Kahn is hired as the new president of basketball operations for the Minnesota Timberwolves to restore hope to a disappointed franchise that won only 24 games in the prior year. Kahn has skilled big men Al Jefferson and Kevin Love as well as three first round picks in his turnaround arsenal.\n\nDraft day arrives, and Kahn selects Spanish PG Ricky Rubio with the 5th overall pick. \"Yes!\" exclaim Wolves fans. \"We need a talented guard alongside Al and Kev!\" Kahn and co. also have the 6th pick. They select another PG, Jonny Flynn. \"Ok, strange...\" muse Wolves fans. Stephen Curry is selected 7th.\n\nWith the final first rounder, Kahn selects PG Ty Lawson. Wolves fans are dumbfounded; \"Surely we don't need three rookie point guards!\" Kahn trades Lawson, who would go on to have the most fruitful career of the three selections, to Denver, for a pick that would become Luke Babbitt.\n\nMinnesota wins 15 games that fateful season. The online Wolves community wants blood. Kahn is not asked to return for the following season. He blames that online community of backseat GMs.\n\n\"You think you can do better than me!?

First and foremost, this is a support group. We all have been touched in some way by this horrible disease.

So please be thoughtful and supportive.\n2.

As this is a support sub, we shy away from \"high level\" scientific articles... If you have any scientific material you would like to post, please make sure it has been vetted in   r Science  https:  www.reddit.com r science  , first. Only then can you cross-post here.\n4. We understand that ALS places an intense financial hardship on the family &amp; friends of the afflicted. However, we **cannot** accept submissions for specific fundraisers, donations, or related requests. However, asking the community for direction towards official aid programs is always allowable. \n\n##What is ALS?\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ALS  is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord.

Severe A1AT deficiency causes panacinar emphysema or COPD in adult life in many people with the condition  especially if they are exposed to cigarette smoke . \n\nThe disorder can lead to various liver diseases in a minority of children and adults, and occasionally more unusual problems. It is treated through avoidance of damaging inhalants and, in severe cases, by intravenous infusions of the A1AT protein or by transplantation of the liver or lungs. It usually produces some degree of disability and reduces life expectancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the common genotypes are:\n\nPiMM: 100%  normal \n\nPiMS: 80% of normal serum level of A1AT\n\nPiSS: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT\n\nPiMZ: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT\n\nPiSZ: 40% of normal serum level of A1AT\n\nPiZZ: 10-15%  severe alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency \n\n\nBeing a carrier means you need to stay away from pollutants more than ordinary people.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency G6PD , Also known as Favism, is an X-linked recessive hereditary disease characterized by abnormally low levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. People with this condition exhibit no symptoms whatsoever unless subjected to environmental or nutritional triggers which cause haemolytic anaemia which can be fatal. \n\n\n\nGPPD is a metabolic enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, especially important in red blood cell metabolism. G6PD deficiency is the most common human enzyme defect. 1  Individuals with the disease may exhibit nonimmune hemolytic anemia in response to a number of causes, most commonly infection or exposure to certain medications or fava beans. \n\n\n\n\nG6PD deficiency is closely linked to favism, a disorder characterized by a hemolytic reaction to consumption of fava or broad beans, with a name derived from the Italian name of the broad bean  fava . The name favism is sometimes used to refer to the enzyme deficiency as a whole, although this is misleading as not all people with G6PD deficiency or Favism will manifest physically observable symptoms to the consumption of broad beans.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This information is for general guidance and is not a substitute for a clinical consultation. Please consult a doctor if you think you have G6PD or if you think you are having a reaction.\n\nDrugs that would start an episode: primaquine, pamaquine, and chloroquine, Nitrofurantoin, Dapsone, Sulphonamides , Methylene Blue\n\n\n\n\n\nDrugs that will exacerbate G6PD deficiency, and carry a definite risk: Sulfonamides  such as sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, and mafenide , thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency, certain analgesics  such as aspirin, phenazopyridine, and acetanilide  and a few non-sulfa antibiotics  nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, dapsone, and furazolidone  Henna has been known to cause haemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants.\n\nFoods to avoid: Broad beans seem to be the only food mentioned by scientific journals and sources that absolutely has to be avoided at all times and in any quantity. \n\nGreen tea has been shown in vitro to cause some a reaction, but only in high doses. \n\nOther internet sources cite avoidance of all Legumes and even some vitamins. However, they do not back their claims with anything other than personal experience of feeling \"less fatigued\". As a result, that advice should be taken at face value.. Support, advice, and awareness for G6PD deficient internet folk :  Whether you have it or care for someone who does, or just curious, please come in and join the conversation.

It is estimated to affect around 1 in 7,000 people and is believed to cause 3,500-4,000 deaths in the United States per year.\n\n**How is LQTS diagnosed and treated?**\n\nLQTS can be genetic or acquired through medications that elongate the QT interval or some eating disorders. It is diagnosed through an EKG that shows an elongated QT interval. Treatment can include beta blockers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and certain lifestyle changes such as avoiding strenuous exercise or potentially startling activities such as haunted houses, roller coasters, or alarm clocks.\n\n**Are there different types of LQTS?**\n\nThere are several genetic variations of LQTS, with types 1, 2, and 3 being the most common. For LQT1, exercise and mental stress are common triggers for episodes, which are more common for LQT1 than other types but often less fatal. For LQT2, loud noises and being startled are common triggers. For LQT3, the highest risk for episodes, which are less frequent but more likely to be fatal, occurs during sleep or immediately after waking.\n\nThis subreddit lists up through LQT8  Timothy Syndrome  for potential user flairs, but there are at least 16 known types. However, many of these are extremely rare  fewer than 20 people worldwide have been reported to have LQT8 . If you have a type not listed, please let us know and we will add it to the flairs list!\n\n**Good resources:**\n\nhttps:  crediblemeds.org  - Website with information on medications that can prolong the QT interval.\n\nhttps:  www.sads.org  - Website for the SADS  Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes  Foundation.

This is not a place to advertise 'gigs' or ask for donations.\n\n2. Flair - You can edit your flair! It is recommended to place your type of dwarfism, and your height if you'd like. In addition, there's coloring for gender if you wish to use that.\n\n3. Trolling and attacks on others are strictly prohibited in this subreddit.  There is no reason to be hateful or try to start something. This is a subreddit for those with dwarfism to connect with each other, and to help educate the public at large!\n\n4. Be respectful to other users. \n\n##TERMINOLOGY\n\n- **Dwarfism**: Any genetic condition that results in an adult height of under 4'10\". There are over 200 forms of dwarfism. Includes  skeletal dysplasia  http:  emedicine.medscape.com article 943343-overview  and  growth hormone deficiencies  http:  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmedhealth PMH0002159  . Skeletal dysplasia usually result in disproportionate dwarfism, where the limbs are disproportionate compared to the head and torso. Growth hormone disorders usually result in proportional dwarfism, where the body is equally proportioned.\n\n- **Little Person**: A term to describe anybody affected by dwarfism or under 4'10\". Widely accepted by the LP community in English-speaking countries. Shorthand is *LP*.\n\n- **Dwarf**: Medically-defined term to refer to a person affected by dwarfism. The plural form is *dwarfs*, although it is commonly mistaken as *dwarves*.\n\n- **Midget**: A term that used to be used to refer to people with proportional dwarfism, until it was popularized by circuses and \"freak shows\" to refer to all LPs in a negative sense. For this reason, it is generally seen as offensive by the majority of LPs.\n\n- **AP**: Average-person, used by LPs to distinguish between themselves and those of average, everyday height.\n\n- **Achon**: Achondroplasia, the most common type of dwarfism.\n\n- **National**: A convention sponsored primarily by the LPA that happens once a year. This is where dwarfs make connections that last a lifetime. It rotates states yearly.\n\n- **Regional**: A smaller, region-based gathering held by an LP organization.\n\n##LINKS\n\n-  Little People of America  http:  www.lpaonline.org \n\n-  Little People of Canada  http:  www.lpo.on.ca lpc index.html \n\n-  Restricted Growth Association  UK   http:  restrictedgrowth.co.uk  \n\n-  Short Statured People of Australia  http:  www.sspa.org.au  \n\n-  Little People of New Zealand  http:  www.littlepeople.org.nz  \n\n-  Dwarfism Types  http:  lpamrs.memberclicks.net dwarfism-types  - A list of types of dwarfism on LPA's website.\n\n-  Understanding Dwarfism  http:  www.understandingdwarfism.com  - A site that was created by a couple in NY who have a daughter with Achondroplasia.

The known estimates for occurrence in society is 1:50,000 with likelihood being 3-5 times greater in males than females, though it does affect both genders.\n\nThe primary difference between HH and Kallmann's Syndrome is anosmia, a lack of sense of smell.

The condition is a common cause of chest pain. Though costochondritis often resolves on its own, it can be a recurring condition that can appear to have little or no signs of onset. Treatment options are quite limited and usually involve a combination of rest, analgesics, or anti-inflammatory medications. Cases with intractable discomfort may be managed with cortisone injections or surgery may be indicated if the condition is severe. Individuals with costochondritis are typically instructed to avoid strenuous physical activity to prevent the onset of an attack.\n\nCostochondritis symptoms can be similar to the chest pain associated with a heart attack. Unexplained chest pain is considered a medical emergency until life-threatening cardiac issues can be ruled out. Severe cases of costal cartilage inflammation that also involve painful swelling are sometimes referred to as Tietze's syndrome, a term sometimes used interchangeably with costochondritis. However, some physicians view costochondritis and Tietze's syndrome as separate disease states due to the absence of costal cartilage swelling in costochondritis..

The name is from the ancient Greek *narco-*  *to put to sleep*  &amp; *-lepsis*  *to have a seizure* .  **Narcoleptics** suffer from the inability to remain awake during the day and to stay asleep through the night.\n\n\n##Causes\n\n\n * Most people who have narcolepsy have low levels of hypocretin. This is a chemical in the brain that helps promote wakefulness. What causes low hypocretin levels isn't well understood.\n\n * It is thought that a combination of the following factors cause low levels of hypocretin:\n \n  * Heredity Genes\n  * Infections\n  * Brain injuries\n  * Autoimmune disorders\n  * Low histamine levels\n\n * Some research suggests that environmental toxins may also trigger narcolepsy.\n\n * \"*Toxins may include heavy metals, pesticides and weed killers, and secondhand smoke.*\"\n\n * Heredity Genes create a disposition towards developing narcolepsy, rather than causing the disorder itself.\n\n * Source:  US National Institute of Health: NHLBI  http:  www.nhlbi.nih.gov health health-topics topics nar causes.html \n\n\n##Symptoms\n\n\n * Common symptoms of Narcolepsy are:\n\n  * Excessive daytime sleepiness\n  * Abnormal REM sleep\n  * Cataplexy  loss of muscle tone \n  * Hallucinations\n  * Sleep paralysis\n  * Microsleep\n  * Nighttime wakefulness\n  * Rapid entry into REM Sleep\n\n * Source  Helpguide.org's Narcolepsy  http:  www.helpguide.org life narcolepsy_symptom_causes_treatments.htm \n\n\n##Diagnosis\n\n * If symptoms of narcolepsy are visible, provide evidence &amp; ask your doctor to refer you for further testing with a specialist.\n\n * This testing often takes place overnight at a sleep clinic, under the watch of professional medical staff.\n\n * The following are used in determining a diagnosis of narcolepsy:\n\n  * Sleep history\n  * Sleep records\n  * Polysomnogram\n  * Multiple sleep latency test\n  * Hypocretin test\n\n * These tests help doctors rule out signs and symptoms that could be linked to similar other sleep disorders.\n\n * Source:  MayoClinic.com's Narcolepsy: Tests &amp; Diagnosis  http:  www.mayoclinic.com health narcolepsy DS00345 DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis \n\n\n##Treatment\n\n\n * Currently there is no cure for Narcolepsy, but the symptoms of narcolepsy are controllable with medication. You should try to maintain a structured sleep schedule, which can include napping during the day if required.\n\n\n\n##Support\n\n\n *  Narcolepsy Network  http:  www.narcolepsynetwork.org  \n *  Wake Up Narcolepsy  https:  www.wakeupnarcolepsy.org  \n *  Stanford Center for Narcolepsy  http:  med.stanford.edu psychiatry narcolepsy  \n *  Narcolepsy Fact Sheet: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  NINDS   http:  www.ninds.nih.gov disorders narcolepsy detail_narcolepsy.htm \n\n\n##Reddits\n\n\n *  r sleep  http:  www.reddit.com r sleep  \n *  r sleepy  http:  www.reddit.com r sleepy  \n *  r nosleep  http:  www.reddit.com r nosleep  \n *  r polyphasic  http:  www.reddit.com r polyphasic  \n *  r GetOutOfBed  http:  www.reddit.com r GetOutOfBed  \n *  r luciddreaming  http:  www.reddit.com r luciddreaming  \n *  r SleepApnea  http:  www.reddit.com r SleepApnea  \n *  r Sleepparalysis  http:  www.reddit.com r Sleepparalysis  .

Facts &amp; Statistics\n\u00c2\u00b7 NF has been classified into three distinct types; NF1, NF2 and schwannomatosis. They are caused by different genes, located on different chromosomes.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 NF1 is the most common neurological disorder caused by a single gene; occuring in one in every 3,000 children born.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 NF2 is a rarer type, occurring in 1:25,000 people worldwide.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 While today there is no consensus, studies indicate that schwannomatosis occurs in 1:40,000 people.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 The Neurofibromatoses are genetically-determined disorders which affect more than 2 million people worldwide; this makes NF more prevalent than cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Huntington's Disease combined.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 All forms of NF are autosomal dominant genetic disorders which can be inherited from a parent who has NF or may be the result of a new or \"spontaneous mutation\"  change  in the sperm or egg cell.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene and developing NF. The type of NF inherited by the child is always the same as that of the affected parent, although the severity of the manifestations may differ from person to person within a family.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 NF is worldwide in distribution, affects both sexes equally and has no particular racial, geographic or ethnic distribution. Therefore, NF can appear in any family.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Although most cases of NF1 are mild to moderate, NF1 can lead to disfigurement; blindness; skeletal abnormalities; dermal, brain, and spinal tumors; loss of limbs; malignancies; and learning disabilities.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 NF1 also has a connection to developmental problems, especially learning disabilities, which are five times more common in the NF1 population than in the general population.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 The distinguishing feature of NF2 is tumors that grow on the eighth cranial nerve in both ears, commonly causing deafness and severe balance problems.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 NF2 brings on increased risk of other types of nervous system tumors as well.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 NF2 can also cause severe vision problems, including cataracts, retinal abnormalities and orbital tumors.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Accordingly, NF research may benefit an additional 100 million Americans  i.e. 65 million with cancer and 35 million with learning disabilities .\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 NF is not the \"Elephant Man's Disease,\" although it was at one time believed to be.
